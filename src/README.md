# Source Code
All the source code is contained in iPython Notebooks. The Topic Modeling is done in the notebook titled TopicModeling.ipynb.
This uses the Gensim library, as well as a custom built api, kept in customapi.py, in order to process the corpus. The other
important notebook is figures.ipynb, which is used to process data and produce the word clouds and temporal graphs. In order 
to execute the scripts contained in the notebooks, the notebook simply needs to be run with the file names contained within
it to the desired files to produce figures.
