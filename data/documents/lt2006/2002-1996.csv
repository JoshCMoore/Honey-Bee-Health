The developed method is based on the matrix solid-phase dispersion technique. A total number of 12 insecticides (azinfos-methyl, buprofezin, chlorpyriphos, chlorpyriphos-methyl, diazinon, ethion, fenitrothion, fipronil, methidathion, phosalone, pirimicarb, propoxur) used on flowering fields are determined by this method. The method uses Florisil and silica as dispersing agents, alumina and silica as cleanup adsorbents and a low polarity solvent system to elute pesticide residues from the honeybee samples. The insecticides were quantified using capillary gas chromatography with a nitrogen-phosphorus detector. The method has shown good recovery (70-110%) for various levels of spiked samples (0.01-1.0 mg/kg). The relative standard deviations were in the range of 2-8% for all pesticides studied. The limits of detection were in the range of 0.005-0.05 mg/kg. The procedure can be applied for the determination of residues of low-polarity and medium polarity pesticides in honeybee samples. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Yet, the ecological and economic underpinnings of most services are poorly understood, impeding their conservation and management. For centuries, farmers have imported colonies of European honey bees (Apis mellifera) to fields and orchards for pollination services. These colonies are becoming increasingly scarce, however, because of diseases, pesticides, and other impacts. Native bee communities also provide pollination services, but the amount they provide and how this varies with land management practices are unknown. Here, we document the individual species and aggregate community contributions of native bees to crop pollination, on farms that varied both in their proximity to natural habitat and management type (organic versus conventional). On organic farms near natural habitat, we found that native bee communities could provide full pollination services even for a crop with heavy pollination requirements (e.g., watermelon, Citrullus lanatus), without the intervention of managed honey bees. All other farms, however, experienced greatly reduced diversity and abundance of native bees, resulting in insufficient pollination services from native bees alone. We found that diversity was essential for sustaining the service, because of year-toyear variation in community composition. Continued degradation of the agro-natural landscape will destroy this ""free"" service, but conservation and restoration of bee habitat are potentially viable economic alternatives for reducing dependence on managed honey bees.","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Ecosystem service; Native bee Apis mellifera",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037168514

Analysis of the Dufour' s gland secretions of workers and queens of both races revealed that there were caste and racial differences. Secretions of queenright A. m. scutellata workers were dominated by a series of long-chain hydrocarbons. In contrast the secretions of the A. m. capensis workers both under queenright and queenless conditions were a mixture of hydrocarbons and wax-type esters, as were those of queens.

The imported dwarf honey bee Apis florea exploited 11 of these. The main pollen flow in the study area occurred between early December and late March. This is reflected by the amount of pollen collected by colonies of A. mellifera sudanensis. In spite of observations conducted soon after the introduction of A. florea, which gave hints of competition between the two bee species, further studies showed that A. mellifera sudanensis and A. florea do seem to coexist. This coexistence is based on different daily rhythms of pollen collection. A. mellifera collected pollen of Acacia seyal, date palm, and onions early in the morning (and partly in the late afternoon), while A. florea started pollen collection mostly later in the morning and ended it earlier in the afternoon. But in contrast to A. mellifera, A. florea was collecting pollen all day without interruption, even at very high air temperatures. Niche overlap (concerning the times of visits to flowers) between the two bee species was very low in date palms, and of medium importance in Acacia seyal. But it is remarkable that in total, A. florea is always present in higher numbers than A. mellifera sudanensis, on flowers.

Between February 1997 and January 1998 monthly records of the amount of pollen, honey, sealed worker and drone brood were recorded. In addition, mite infestation levels of adult bees and worker brood and the fecundity of the mites reproducing in worker cells were determined. The mean number of sealed worker brood cells (10,070 ± 1,790) remained fairly constant over the experimental period in each colony. However, the presence and amount of sealed drone brood was very variable. One colony had drone brood for 10 months and another for only 1 month. Both the mean infestation level of worker brood (18.1 ± 8.4%) and adult bees (3.5 ± 1.3%) remained fairly constant over the study period and did not increase rapidly as is normally observed in European honey bees. In fact, the estimated mean number of mites fell from 3,500 in February 1997 to 2,380 in January 1998. In May 2000 the mean mite population in the study colonies was still only 1,821 mites. The fertility level of mites in this study was much higher (83-96%) than in AHB in Brazil (25-57%), and similar to that found in EHB (76-94%). Mite fertility remained high throughout the entire study and was not influenced by the amount of pollen, honey or worker brood in the colonies.","Africanized bees; Apis mellifera; Mexico; Reproduction; Tolerance; Varroa destructor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036969974

Bee venom is also a complex mixture of enzymes and proteins. Thus, this study was conducted to examine the effects of bee venom (BV, Apis mellifera) fractions on apical transporters' activity and its related signal pathways in primary cultured renal proximal tubule cells. Whole BV was extracted into three fractions according to solubility [a water-soluble fraction (BVA), an ethylacetate-soluble fraction (BVE), and a hexane-soluble fraction (BVH)]. BVA fraction was further separated to three portions according to molecular weights: BF1 (&gt;20 kD), BF2 (10-20 kD), and BF3 (&lt;10 kD). Each fraction was treated to the PTCs to the ratio of BV (1 μg/ml). BVA (930 ng/ml) significantly decreased cell viability, but BVH (27 ng/ml) and BVE (43 ng/ml) did not. BF3 (710 ng/ml) among BVA fractions predominantly decreased cell viability and inhibited α-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (α-MG), phosphate (Pi), and Na+ uptake. In addition, BF3 increased [3H] arachidonic acid release, lipid peroxide formation, and Ca2+ uptake. These effects of BF3 were blocked by mepacrine and AACOCF3 (phospholipase A2 inhibitors) or N-acetylcysteine, vitamin C, and vitamin E (antioxidants). In conclusion, BF3 (&lt;10 kD) among BV fractions is the most effective portion in BV-induced inhibition of α-MG, Pi, and Na+ uptake and these effects of BF3 are associated with phospholipase A2-oxidative stress-Ca2+ signal cascade in the primary cultured rabbit renal proximal tubule cells.

Young nest bees care for brood around the clock with no circadian rhythms while older foragers have strong circadian rhythms that are used for sun compass navigation and for timing visits to flowers. Since juvenile hormone (JH) is involved in the coordination of physiological and behavioral processes underlying age-related division of labor in honey bees, we tested the hypothesis that JH influences the ontogeny of circadian rhythms and other clock parameters in young worker bees. Treatments with the JH analog methoprene or allatectomy did not influence the onset of rhythmicity, overall locomotor activity, or the free-running period of rhythmic locomotor behavior. There were, however, significant differences in the onset of rhythmicity, overall locomotor activity, and longevity between bees from different source colonies, suggesting that there is significant genetic variation for these traits. Our results suggest that JH does not coordinate all aspects of division of labor in bees and that coordination of task performance with circadian rhythms is probably mediated by other regulatory systems. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

An Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) study identified isolated magnetite nanoparticles and aggregates of these particles with a low temperature transition (52 K - 91 K). Hysteresis curves of Apis mellifera abdomens organized parallel and perpendicular to the applied magnetic field were obtained from 5K to 310K. At low temperatures, the hysteresis curves indicate a preferential orientation of the magnetic easy axis parallel to the body axis.

The culture of the bacterial samples in medium with venom revealed that 95.8% of the colonies are resistant to the different concentrations of the venom, and 4.2% were non-resistant at concentrations of 90 μg/mL (E. coli) and 100 μg/mL (S. aureus). The non resistant sample lysis occurred maybe due to the activity of some venom components, such as phospholipase A2 and melittin, which act on the cellular membrane.

Nevertheless, in Brazil an isolated population of Italian honey bees has been kept on an island since 1984 without treatment against this mite. The infestation rates in these colonies have decreased over the years. We looked for possible varroa-tolerance factors in six Italian honey bee colonies prepared with queens from this Brazilian island population, compared to six Carniolan colonies, both tested at the same site in Germany. One such factor was the percentage of damaged mites in the colony debris, which has been reported as an indicator of colony tolerance to varroa. A mean of 35.8% of the varroa mites collected from the bottoms of the Italian bee colonies were found damaged, among which 19.1% were still alive. A significantly greater proportion of damaged mites were found in the Carniolan bees (42.3%) and 22.5% were collected alive. The most frequent kind of damage found was damaged legs alone, affecting 47.4% of the mites collected from debris in Italian bees, which was similar to the amount found in Carniolan colonies (46%). The mean infestation rate by the varroa mite in the worker brood cells in the Italian bee colonies was 3.9% in June and 3.5% in July, and in drone brood cells it was 19.3% in June. In the Carniolan honey bee colonies the mean infestation rates in worker brood cells were 3.0 and 6.7%, respectively in the months of June and July and 19.7% in drone brood cells in June. In conclusion, the 'Varroa-tolerant' Italian honey bees introduced from Brazil produced lower percentages of damaged mites (Varroa destructor) in hive debris and had similar brood infestation rates when compared to 'susceptible' Carniolan bees in Germany. In spite of the apparent adaptation of this population of Italian bees in Brazil, we found no indication of superiority of these bees when we examined the proportions of damaged mites and the varroa-infestation rates, compared to Carniloan bees kept in the same apiary in Germany.","Apis mellifera carnica; Apis mellifera ligustica; Host-parasite relationship; Natural selection; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3242745250

Bagging experiments and comparative breeding system studies were carried out at different study sites and in different seasons. Our results revealed four important aspects of the reproductive biology of Musella. 1) This species blooms year round, but most flowering is concentrated from February to August. The longevity of female flowers is greater than that of male flowers and opening of both types of flowers occurs at anytime during the day, but is concentrated in the morning. 2) Although nectar is produced uniformly while flowers are open, the nectar volume and rate of female flowers are significantly higher than that of male flowers. 3) Insects, such as bumblebees (Bombus eximius and B. montivolans), honeybees (Apis cerana and A. florea), and wasps (Vespa mandarinia) are the primary floral visitors and show a preference for female flowers. 4) Both fruit and seed set are pollinator-limited at both study sites.

Seven Apis mellifera colonies that had mite populations resistant to the acaricide Apistan® were used. Pyrethroid-resistance was confirmed when only 17% rather than 90% of mites confined in dishes containing Apistan® died after 12 h of exposure. The average number of eggs laid by resistant mites invading worker and drone cells was 4.4 and 5.4 respectively. This is similar to the number of eggs laid by susceptible mites in worker (4.4-4.8) or drone (4.7-5.5) cells. Also the average number of fertilised V. destructor female mites produced by resistant mites in worker (1.0) and drone (2.1) cells were similar to the number produced by susceptible mites in worker (0.9) and drone (1.9-2.2) cells. In addition, no major differences between the resistant and susceptible mite populations were observed in either worker or drone cells when six different reproductive categories and offspring mortality rates were compared.

We surveyed damaging insects and pathogens, and arthropod natural enemies on Alnus acuminata and A. nepalensis in Kabale and Mbale districts, Uganda between March 1999 and August 2000 in order to identify the range and relative abundance of arthropods and pathogens associated with the Alnus species. Frequently encountered damaging insects on the Alnus species included Apis mellifera, Apion globulipenne, a Systates sp. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Phymateus viridipes, a Lobotrachelus sp. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Coloborrtics corticina and some Chrysomelidae. Some species such as Aphis fabae, Parastictococcus multispinosus and a Cacopsylla sp. (Homoptera: Psyllidae) were observed feeding on other agroforestry tree species and/or crops although they generally occurred at low population intensities. Spiders and parasitic Hymenoptera were the most common natural enemies. Diseases were more severe in nurseries than in the field. Damping-off caused by Fusarium oxysporum, Septoria brown leaf spot and stem canker were the most serious diseases of Alnus. The array of damaging insects and pathogens indicates a potential danger to the cultivation of Alnus species in Uganda as adoption of the species for agroforestry continues to expand in the country. In view of the increasing demand for Alnus species for agroforestry in Uganda, regular pest monitoring and appropriate control strategies are necessary.","Diseases; Insects; Multipurpose tree species; Pests",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036940233

The order of genes encoding proteins is identical to that of most arthropods. Ten of 22 transfer RNAs are in different locations relative to hard ticks, and the 12S ribosomal RNA subunit is inverted and separated from the 16S rRNA by a novel non-coding region, a trait not yet seen in other arthropods. We describe a dispersed set of 45 oligonucleotide primers that can be used to address genetic questions in Varroa.

Farmers' ability to recognise pest problems on Alnus species was significantly influenced by their length of experience in cultivating the species, but not their age, sex or formal education. Most farmers (77%) were aware of pest problems on Alnus species. However, identification of pest problems was based largely on damage type rather than causal agents. Whereas farmers had good knowledge of vertebrate pests of Alnus, insects and diseases that infest the tree species were unknown to most farmers. Apis mellifera damage on Alnus was the most frequently described damage, but its cause was either unknown or misdiagnosed. Most farmers did not control insect and disease infestations on Alnus because they did not know the causal agents and/or appropriate control measures. Farmers were generally more knowledgeable on insect and disease infestations on crops than on multipurpose tree species (MPTS) and most of them (98%) perceived that crops suffer more damage from such pests than do MPTS. However, farmers' ability to manage insect pests and diseases seemed weak on both crops and MPTS. Most farmers suggested the use of pesticides to combat pests, but they mentioned only one insecticide, permethrin and one fungicide, mancozeb. More alarming were the suggestions by a few farmers on the use of mancozeb against aphids, and permethrin to combat crop wilt and dieback. Farmers need to be educated about diagnosis, basic ecology and management strategies for both crop and tree pests to ensure sustainable pest control in agroforestry. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study aimed to verify possible effects exerted on the attractiveness towards pollinators by the application on lucerne plants of high concentrations of three volatile compounds, the aldehyde trans-2-hexenal, the alcohol oct-1-en-3-ol, and the terpene ocimene, naturally present in lucerne flower aroma. In each of three test days, three potted plants per odour treatment were sprayed with each compound, whereas three unsprayed plants were used as a natural control treatment. All the plants were located in the proximity of an apiary with five honey bee colonies. The number of visits by both honey bees and other pollinating hymenopterans were recorded on each plant between 14.30 h and 15.30 h every day, and between 17.00 h and 17.30 h on the second and third days. Every day at 18.00 h, the 12 plants were placed back under an isolation cage, where five other plants were kept throughout as a control, not pollinated by insects. After about 40 days, number and weight of seeds were recorded on all 41 plants. Chemical analyses on bulked flowers collected from all plants confirmed previous results (high concentrations of trans2-hexenal, relatively large amounts of oct-1-en-3-ol, and limited amounts of ocimene). The effect of pollinating insects was remarkable on seed set, as indicated by the comparison between the 36 plants used in the outdoor trial and the five plants always kept in the cage. There seemed to be some attractive effect of ocimene on honey bees, whereas wild pollinating hymenopterans preferred the unsprayed control plants. The results also demonstrated the preponderant role of flower visits by wild pollinating hymenopterans on lucerne seed set, whereas honey bees confirmed to be poor pollinators of this crop.","Attractiveness; Lucerne (medicago sativa l.); Pollination; Seed set; Volatile compounds",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2942708937

The encoded precursor of BmKAPi consisted of 89 amino acid residues including a signal peptide of 24 residues, a putative mature peptide of 64 residues (BmKAPi) and an extra basic residue at the C-terminus which might be removed in the post-translational processing. BmKAPi is stabilized by five disulfide bridges, whereas all other disulfide-bridged scorpion toxins described are cross-linked by three or four disulfide bridges. It suggested the three-dimensinal scaffold of BmKAPi might be different from other scorpion toxins. The amino acid sequence of BmKAPi showed no homology with other scorpion venom peptides, but shared a little similarity with some anticoagulant peptides and proteinase inhibitors isolated from hookworm, honeybee or European frog, respectively. RT-PCR analysis showed that BmKAPi mRNA could be induced by venom extraction suggesting BmKAPi might be a component of scorpion venom. These results suggest that BmKAPi is a new type of scorpion venom peptide different from other described scorpion toxins in structural and functional aspects. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 320 Morrill Hall, 505 S. Goodwin Avenue, Urbana, IL 61801, United States","Efficient division of labor is one of the main reasons for the success of the social insects. In honey bees the division of labor is principally achieved by workers changing tasks as they age. Typically, young adult bees perform a series of tasks within the colony before ultimately making the transition to foraging outside the hive for resources. This lifelong behavioral development is a well-characterized example of naturally occurring behavioral plasticity, but its neural bases are not well understood. Two techniques were used to assess the role of biogenic amines in the transition from in-hive work to foraging, which is the most dramatic and obvious transition in honey bee behavioral development. First, associations between amines and tasks were determined by measuring the levels of amines in dissected regions of individual bee brains using HPLC analysis. Second, colonies were orally treated with biogenic amines and effects on the onset of foraging were observed. Octopamine concentration in the antennal lobes of the bee brain was most reliably associated with task: high in foragers and low in nurses regardless of age. In contrast, octopamine in the mushroom bodies, a neighboring neuropil, was associated with age and not behavior, indicating independent modulation of octopamine in these two brain regions. Treating colonies with octopamine resulted in an earlier onset of foraging in young bees. In addition, octopamine levels were not elevated by non-foraging flight, but were already high on return from the first successful foraging trip and subsequently remained high, showing no further change with foraging experience. This observation suggests that octopamine becomes elevated in the antennal lobes in anticipation of foraging and is involved in the release and maintenance of the foraging state. Foraging itself, however, does not modulate octopamine levels. Behaviorally related changes in octopamine are modulated by juvenile hormone, which has also been implicated in the control of honey bee division of labor. Treatment with the juvenile hormone analog methoprene elevated octopamine and octopamine treatment 'rescued' the delay in behavioral development caused by experimentally depleting juvenile hormone in bees. Although the pathways linking juvenile hormone and octopamine are presently unknown, it is clear that octopamine acts 'downstream' of juvenile hormone to influence behavior and that juvenile hormone modulates brain octopamine levels. A working hypothesis is that octopamine acts as an activator of foraging by modulating responsiveness to foraging-related stimuli. This is supported by the finding that octopamine treatment increased the response of bees to brood pheromone, a stimulator of foraging activity. Establishing a role for octopamine in honey bee behavioral development is a first step in understanding the neural bases of this example of naturally occurring, socially mediated, behavioral plasticity. The next level of analysis will be to determine precisely where and how octopamine acts in the nervous system to coordinate this complex social behavior. Copyright © 2003 S.

An important consequence of this procedure is captured in the economic concept of rationality, defined through a number of principles that are necessary for the existence of an ordinal scale of value upon which organisms base their choices. Violations of these principles, such as some recently reported breaches of transitivity and regularity in birds and honeybees, have strong implications for the understanding of decision mechanisms in humans and nonhumans alike. We investigated rationality in risky choice using European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris. Birds had to choose between two or three food sources, each associated with a different variance in delay to reward. In three experiments, starlings were strongly risk prone, showing regular and consistent preferences in binary and trinary choices. Preferences also satisfied weak and strong stochastic transitivity. Our results extend the generality of previous research in risk-sensitive foraging to situations where more than two alternatives are present and suggest that violations of rationality in risk-sensitive choices may be expressed only under restricted sets of conditions. © 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Queenless workers had higher tyramine levels and lower N-acetyltyramine levels than normal workers did. Intermediate reproductive workers that were transferred into a normal colony from a queenless colony had intermediate levels of tyramine and N-acetyltyramine. Elevation of tyramine in the queenless workers occurred at an earlier adult stage than elevation of dopamine. Tyramine levels in intermediate reproductive workers returned to the levels seen in normal workers, but dopamine levels in intermediate reproductive workers remained elevated at the same level as in queenless workers. Thus, brain tyramine may be regulated by the colony condition with or without a queen. Injection of an amine uptake inhibitor, reserpine, depleted tyramine and elevated N-acetyltyramine. Distributions of tyramine and dopamine within the brain were distinctively different, whereas distributions of N-acetyltyramine and N-acetyldopamine were similar, suggesting that each functional amine is stored in specific neurosecretory cells and released to the relevant receptor sites but that metabolism into each N-acetylmetabolite is determined by diffusion. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This plant inhabits the high altitudinal sub-alpine zone, which is characterized by a harsh climate, low species diversity and a short growing season. Echium wildpretii is a monocarpic perennial, producing a 2-3 m column-shaped, red-flowered, nectar-rich inflorescence. Although these floral traits have previously been suggested as being typical of ornithophilous flowers, this is the first study reporting observations of native birds (Phylloscopus collybita and Serinus canarius) in addition to insects visiting the flowers for nectar. The purposes of this study were firstly to investigate levels of visitation by native birds, native insects, and introduced honey bees. Secondly, we studied the influence of floral display (plant height and number of flowers), nearest neighbours (distance and size) and local vegetation structure on visitation rate. Finally, we discuss the evolution of ornithophily in an otherwise entomophilous plant lineage. We found that the level of bird visitation was relatively high early in the flowering season, but decreased in mid/late season, while the opposite pattern was found for introduced honey bees. For native insects, the frequency of visits was similar in early and late season. Bird visits were correlated with floral display. In the early season, visitation rates of honey bees and the two most common native bee species were correlated with size of the plant or its nearest neighbours, consistent with preference patterns for larger resource patches. Since only insects visit the flowers of other species in the Echium clade, E. wildpretii appears to have evolved from a truly insect-pollinated lineage. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

Sci. 77, 138-145). We describe a detailed experimental and mathematical analysis of information exchange and decision-making in, arguably, the most difficult collective choices that social insects face: namely, house hunting by complete societies. The key issue is how can a complete colony select the single best nest-site among several alternatives? Individual scouts respond to the diverse information they have personally obtained about the quality of a potential nest-site by producing a recruitment signal. The colony then deliberates over (i.e. integrates) different incoming recruitment signals associated with different potential nest-sites to achieve a well-informed collective decision. We compare this process in honeybees and in the ant Leptothorax albipennis. Notwithstanding many differences - for example, honeybee colonies have 100 times more individuals than L. albipennis colonies - there are certain similarities in the fundamental algorithms these societies appear to employ when they are house hunting. Scout honeybees use the full power of the waggle dance to inform their nest-mates about the distance and direction of a potential nest-site (and they indicate the quality of a nest-site indirectly through the vigour of their dance), and yet individual bees perhaps only rarely make direct comparisons of such sites. By contrast, scouts from L. albipennis colonies often compare nest-sites, but they cannot directly inform one another of their estimation of the quality of a potential site. Instead, they discriminate between sites by initiating recruitment sooner to better ones. Nevertheless, both species do make use of forms of opinion polling. For example, scout bees that have formerly danced for a certain site cease such advertising and monitor the dances of others at random. That is, they act without prejudice. They neither favour nor disdain dancers that advocate the site they had formerly advertised or the alternatives. Thus, in general the bees are less well informed than they would be if they systematically monitored dances for alternative sites rather than spending their time reprocessing information they already have. However, as a result of their lack of prejudice, less time overall will be wasted in endless debate among stubborn and potentially biased bees. Among the ants, the opinions of nest-mates are also pooled effectively when scouts use a threshold population of their nest-mates present in a new nest-site as a cue to switch to more rapid recruitment. Furthermore, the ants' reluctance to begin recruiting to poor nest-sites means that more time is available for the discovery and direct comparison of alternatives. Likewise, the retirement of honeybee scouts from dancing for a given site allows more time for other scouts to find potentially better sites. Thus, both the ants and the bees have time-lags built into their decision-making systems that should facilitate a compromise between thorough surveys for good nest-sites and relatively rapid decisions. We have also been able to show that classical mathematical models can illuminate the processes by which colonies are able to achieve decisions that are relatively swift and very well informed.","Decision-making; House hunting; Mathematical models; Social insects",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037195899

T. incisa exhibits protandry within flowers and umbels; however, an overlap of 3 days in male and female phases among umbels of consecutive orders permits geitonogamous pollination. There are 72 ± 2.0 (n = 74) white flowers per umbel and nectar is presented during the male and female phases. Apis mellifera appears to be the main diurnal pollinator. The pollen:ovule ratio is 1902:1, indicating that T. incisa is a facultatively xenogamous species. The long phase of pollen presentation and the low natural seed set of about 45% implies that many flowers are functioning as pollen donors only.

Here we assess whether the invasion of exotic plants - mostly mediated by habitat disturbance - facilitates the invasion of exotic flower visitors in temperate forests of the southern Andes, Argentina. We recorded visit frequencies and the identity of visitors to the flowers of 15 native and 15 exotic plant species occurring in different highly disturbed and less disturbed habitats. We identified three alien flower visitors, the hymenopterans Apis mellifera, Bombus ruderatus, and Vespula germanica. We found significantly more visitation by exotic insects in disturbed habitats. This pattern was explained, at least in part, by the association between alien flower visitors and flowers of exotic plants, which occurred more frequently in disturbed habitats. However, this general pattern masked different responses between the two main alien flower visitors. Apis mellifera exploited almost exclusively the flowers of a subset of herbaceous exotic plants that thrive under disturbance, whereas B. ruderatus visited equally flowers of both exotic and native plants in both disturbed and undisturbed habitats. We did not find any strong evidence that flowers of exotic plants were more generalist than those of native plants, or that exotic flower visitors were more generalist than their native counterparts. Our results suggest that alien plant species could facilitate the invasion of at least some exotic flower visitors to disturbed habitats. Because flowering plants as well as flower visitors benefit from this mutualism, this association may enhance, through a positive feedback, successful establishment of both exotic partners.","Exotic plants and flower visitors; Facilitation; Forest habitat disturbance; Generalisation; Plant-pollinator interactions; Southern South America",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036034952

The mite has developed resistance to fluvalinate, an acaricide used to control it in beehives, and fluvalinate residues have been found in the beeswax, necessitating an urgent need to find alternative control measures to suppress this pest. Accordingly, we investigated the possibility of using the fungus, Hirsutella thompsonii, as a biocontrol agent of the Varroa mite. Among the 9 isolates of H. thompsonii obtained from the University of Florida and the USDA, only the 3 USDA isolates (ARSEF 257, 1947 and 3323) were infectious to the Varroa mite in laboratory tests. The mite became infected when it was allowed to walk on a sporulating H. thompsonii culture for 5 min. Scanning electron micrographs revealed that the membranous arolium of the mite leg sucker is the focus of infection where the fungal conidia adhered and germinated. The infected mites died from mycosis, with the lethal times to kill 50% (LT50s) dependent on the fungal isolates. Thus, the LT50s were 52.7, 77.2, and 96.7 h for isolates 3323, 257, and 1947, respectively. Passage of H. thompsonii through Varroa mite three times significantly reduced the LT50s of isolates 257 and 1947 (P &lt; 0.05) but not the LT50 of isolate 3323. The fungus did not infect the honey bee in larval, prepupal, pupal, and adult stages under our laboratory rearing conditions. Our encouraging results suggest that some isolates of H. thompsonii have the potential to be developed as a biocontrol agent for V. destructor. However, fungal infectivity against the mites under beehive conditions needs to be studied before any conclusion can be made. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Language advocates then ignored basic precepts of scientific process, rejected and/or ignored results not in accord with their favored hypothesis, and instead repeatedly sought additional supportive evidence.

By invoking ad hoc modifications and qualifications, advocates weakened, rather than strengthened, the hypothesis they continued to embrace.

Detection of the causative agent, Paenibacillus larvae subspecies larvae, is a very important concern in order to prevent disease dissemination and decrease of honey production. Since spores are the infective forms of this pathogen, in the present work we report the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect P. l. subsp. larvae spores from in vitro cultures, larvae with clinical symptoms and experimentally contaminated honey. The set of primers was designed based on the published P. l. subsp. larvae 16S rRNA gene. Using this approach we could amplify the pathogen DNA and obtain a great sensitivity and a notable specificity. Detection limit for spore suspension was a 10-2 dilution of template DNA obtained from 32 spores, as determined by plate count. For artificially contaminated honey, we could detect the PCR product at a 10-3 dilution of template DNA obtained from 170 spores. In addition, when PCR conditions were set to improve specificity, we were able to amplify P. l. subsp. larvae DNA selectively and no cross-reactions were observed with a variety of related bacterial species, including P. l. subsp. pulvifaciens. Since spore detection is very important to confirm the presence of the disease, this method provides a reliable diagnosis of AFB from infected larvae and contaminated honey in a few hours.","16S rRNA; American foulbrood; American foulbrood-contaminated honey; Dead bee larvae; Paenibacillus larvae subspecies larvae; Polymerase chain reaction; Spore detection",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036828388

The dance language has been the subject of controversy3,4, and of extensive research into the mechanisms of acquiring1,5,6, decoding7,8 and evaluating9 the information in the dance. The dance language has been hypothesized, but not shown, to increase colony food collection1,9,10. Here we show that colonies with disoriented dances (lacking direction information) recruit less effectively to syrup feeders than do colonies with oriented dances. For colonies foraging at natural sources, the direction information sometimes increases food collected, but at other times it makes no difference. The food-location information in the dance is presumably important when food sources are hard to find, variable in richness and ephemeral. Recruitment based simply on arousal of foragers and communication of floral odour, as occurs in honeybees1, bumble bees11 and some stingless bees12, can be equally effective under other circumstances. Clarifying the condition-dependent payoffs of the dance language provides new insight into its function in honeybee ecology.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037206860

The A. m. capensis strain that is parasitic has at least two traits that make it a serious pest of the native African bee colonies: workers rapidly develop their ovaries when in a non-capensis colony even when a queen is present, and worker-laid eggs are not killed by worker policing. Here we investigate whether A. m. capensis workers also have special mechanisms to circumvent the guard bees of A. m. scutellata thereby aiding their horizontal transmission between infected and non-infected colonies. We studied the acceptance of non-nestmate A. m. capensis and A. m. scutellata bees by guards of African bee colonies by introducing them to the hive entrance of A. m. scutellata colonies. We used 2 A. m. scutellata discriminator colonies that were both split into a queenright and a queenless portion. Our results suggest that invading workers of A. m. capensis have no special mechanisms to circumvent the African guards. Neither race of the introduced bee nor presence or absence of the queen in the guarding colony affected the proportion of introduced workers accepted. When pooled, 15% of introduced A. m. capensis and 18% of A. m. scutellata non-nestmate workers were accepted by African guards.","A. m. scutellata; Apis mellifera capensis; Guard bees; Mandibular gland pheromones (QMP); Parasitism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036392355

The treated eggs developed into the anaphase of the first meiotic division at 15 min after treatment, whereas the untreated eggs remained arrested at the metaphase of the first meiotic division. The results of histological examination of the common oviduct showed that its inner widths were sufficiently narrow to cause the distortion of eggs passing through it. The distorted eggs could be fertilized and develop into diploid embryos if they were exposed to the semen immediately (within 30 sec) after egg distortion. However, this would not happen if the distorted eggs were exposed to semen later (30 min). The eggs exposed to the semen but not given mechanical stimuli could initiate the embryonic development with diploid chromosomes. The interval between mechanical distortion and sperm acceptance by eggs in vitro is compatible with that of natural oviposition of fertilized eggs by honeybee queens. These results suggest that egg activation by mechanical stresses in the common oviduct is valid for the natural oviposition in honeybees.","Apis mellifera; Development; Eggs; Fertilization; Sperm",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036389752

We then observed all instances of aggression against marked workers for 3 hours. The colonies were then killed and all marked bees retrieved and scored for ovary activation. About 10-40% of workers had activated ovaries. In 3 of 6 colonies, wild-type workers were attacked more often if they had activated ovaries than workers without activated ovaries. Anarchistic workers were more likely to be attacked if they had activated ovaries in one anarchistic host colony only, but in one wild-type host they were more likely to be attacked if they had inactive ovaries. In all colonies there was no significant difference in attack rates between anarchistic and wild-type workers with activated ovaries. This indicates that, like wild-type workers, anarchistic workers are unable to mask their ovary activation from other workers.

Apis mellifera was observed foraging selectively on young Alnus leaves and buds in search of a sticky substance, apparently propolis. In so doing, the bee created wounds that enlarged and caused tattering of Alnus leaves as they matured. Biological surveys indicated that the damage was prevalent and occurred widely, particularly on Alnus acuminata Kunth in Uganda. Incidence of the Apis mellifera damage on Alnus acuminata peaked in the dry season, with up to 90% of leaves emerging per shoot per month damaged, and was lowest in the wet months during peak leaf emergence. Apis mellifera leaf damage was consistently higher on Alnus acuminata than A. nepalensis D. Don., on saplings than mature trees, and on sun exposed than shaded leaves.

The lowest reported values (approximately 0.3 Wg-1) occur in tethered bees generating the minimum lift to support their body weight, free-flying 2-day old bees, winter bees, or bees flying at high air temperatures (45°C). The highest values (approximately 0.8 Wg-1) occur in foragers that are heavily loaded or flying in low-density air. In different studies, flight metabolic rate has increased, decreased, or remained constant with air temperature. Current research collectively suggests that this variation occurs because flight metabolic rates decrease at thorax temperatures above or below 38°C. At 30°C, approximately 30% of colonial energy is spent during typical foraging, so variation in flight metabolic rate can strongly affect colony-level energy balance. Higher air temperatures tend to increase colonial net gain rates, efficiencies and honey storage rates due to lower metabolic rates during flight and in the hive. Variation in flight metabolism has a clear genetic basis. Different genetic strains of honey bees often differ in flight metabolic rate, and these differences in flight physiology can be correlated with foraging effort, suggesting a possible pathway for selection effects on flight metabolism. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Learning flights are longest following initial visits to the food and subsequently decline in duration, which suggests that the investment in learning results from an active decision modulated by a bee's accumulating experience. We document various factors that influence this decision: (1) learning flights reappear when experienced bees encounter a delay in finding food at a familiar place and the durations of such ""reorientation flights"" increase with the length of the delay; (2) the decay in learning flight duration over visits following such reorientation flights is more rapid than following initial discovery of the food; (3) learning flight duration increases with the visual complexity of the scene surrounding the food, and when spatial relationships among landmarks are unstable; and (4) durations of learning flights at a new feeding place are influenced by the sucrose concentration in the food. Taken together, these experiments suggest that bees can adjust their learning efforts in response to changing needs for visual information and that both sources of spatial uncertainty and the quality of the food influence the value of such information.","Honeybee; Learning flight; Navigation; Spatial learning; Turn back and look (TBL)",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036826593

Two dancers performed 4 dances except for waggle dancing. No.874 performed transition dancing even at the 105-m feeder.

Shaking and tremble dancing were often observed on cold days, and/or in unsuccessful flights and in the start or end of the flights on warm days.

Glomeruli undergo significant changes in volume during the lifetime of the adult worker bee, at least some of which are activity dependent. This study tests the commonly expressed assumption that increases in neuropil volume are accompanied by an underlying increase in the number of synapses present in the tissue. A combination of light and electron microscopy was used to determine total synapse number within two glomeruli, T1-44 and T4-2(1). The Cavalieri direct estimator of volume was applied to 1.5 μm sections of resin-embedded brains. Selected sections were then re-embedded and prepared for transmission electron microscopy. Synapse densities were determined using the physical disector method on electron micrographs, Synapse density and glomerulus volume were combined to give an unbiased estimate of the total number of synapses. In glomerulus T1-44, a significant increase in volume was accompanied by a significant increase in the total number of synapses. In contrast, synapse counts in T4-2(1) remained unchanged, despite a significant increase in the volume of this glomerulus. These results demonstrate that synapse proliferation in antennal lobes of the adult worker bee is highly site specific. Although volumetric changes and changes in synapse number both contribute to the structural plasticity of the antennal lobes, these two components of plasticity appear to be independent processes.","Apis mellifera; Olfactory bulbs; Stereology; Structural plasticity; Synapse; Transmission electron microscopy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036812514

In particular, the labiomaxillary complex is essential for food intake. In the present study we investigated the anatomical design of the labiomaxillary complex in various ant species, focusing on movement mechanisms. Six labial and six maxillary muscles with different functions control the several joints and ensure the proper performance of the labiomaxillary complex. According to our measurements of sarcomere lengths, muscle fiber lengths and diameters, and the relative muscle volumes, the labial and maxillary muscles feature rather slow than fast muscle characteristics and do not seem to be specialized for specific tasks. Since glossa protractor muscles are absent, the protraction of the glossa, the distal end of the labium, is a nonmuscular movement. By histological measurements of hemolymph volumes we could exclude a pressure-driven mechanism. Additional experiments showed that, upon relaxation of the glossa retractor muscles, the glossa protracts elastically. This elastic mechanism possibly sets an upper limit to licking frequency, thus influencing food intake rates and ultimately foraging behavior. In contrast to many other elastic mechanisms among arthropods, glossa protraction in ants is based on a mechanism where elasticity works as an actual antagonist to muscles. We compared the design of the labiomaxillary complex of ants with that of the honeybee and suggest an elastic mechanism for glossa protraction in honeybees as well. J.

In most neopteran insects, the mushroom bodies receive direct olfactory input. In addition, the calyces of Hymenoptera receive substantial direct input from the optic lobes. We describe visual inputs to the calyces of the mushroom bodies of the honeybee Apis mellifera, the neurons'dendritic fields in the optic lobes, the medulla and lobula, and the organization of their terminals in the calyces. Medulla neurons terminate in the collar region of the calyx, where they segregate into five layers that receive alternating input from the dorsal or ventral medulla, respectively. A sixth, innermost layer of the collar receives input from lobula neurons. In the basal ring region of the calyx, medulla neuron terminals are restricted to a small, distal part. Lobula neurons are more prominent in the basal ring, where they terminate in its outer half. Although the collar and basal ring layers generally receive segregated input from both optic neuropils, some overlap occurs at the borders of the layers. At least three different types of mushroom body input neurons originate from the medulla: (a) neurons with narrow dendritic fields mainly restricted to the vicinity of the medulla's serpentine layer and found throughout the medulla; (b) neurons restricted to the ventral half of the medulla and featuring long columnar dendritic branches in the outer medulla; and (c) a group of neurons whose dendrites are restricted to the most ventral part of the medulla and whose axons form the anterior inferior optic tract. Most medulla neurons (groups a and b) send their axons via the anterior superior optic tract to the mushroom bodies. Neurons connecting the lobula with the mushroom bodies have their dendrites in a defined dorsal part of the lobula. Their axons form a third tract to the mushroom bodies, here referred to as the lobula tract. Our findings match the anatomy of intrinsic mushroom body neurons (Strausfeld, 2002) and together indicate that the mushroom bodies may be composed of many more functional subsystems than previously suggested. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Higher brain centers; Optic lobes; Social insects",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037200893

All were protogynous. Stigmas were receptive and had pollen deposited on them 2 days before anther dehiscence. The period of anthesis in the three bamboos was 3 days. Individual pollen grains of the three species were similar in size (30-40 μm in diameter) and had features typical of wind-pollinated plants. The ratios of pollen to ovules (p/o ratio) in P. nidularia, P. heteroclada and P. nuda were 6500, 12 700 and 33 000, respectively. Mean pollen loads on each flower (one ovule) of these three species were 7.3, 8.8 and 9.4 grains, respectively. Pollen transfer in P. heteroclada and P. nuda depended on wind, and no flower visitors were seen in the field. However, in P. nidularia, Apis cerana Fab. was a frequent pollen collector observed from 1200 to 1330 h. The visits undertaken by thousands of honeybees resulted in a large number of pollen grains being released from the anthers in a short time (10-15 min) in one day, which accelerated and synchronized the release of pollen from the anthers that seemed to enhance the chance of pollination. Given that honeybees played an indirect role in pollen transfer this could partly explain the low p/o ratio in P. nidularia. Reviewing the literature, we found insect visits to flowers of bamboos were not infrequent phenomena. We suggest pollination efficiency should be considered as one selective factor in attempts to understand mast flowering in bamboo. © 2002 The Linnean Society of London.","Floral syndrome; Mast flowering; P. nuda; Phyllostachys heteroclada; Pollen/ovule ratio; Pollination efficiency",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036036046

Most agricultural pollination is provided as an unpaid service by feral A. mellifera and native insects. A smaller proportion of agricultural pollination is provided as a paid service by beekeepers. Insect pollination is threatened by misuse of insecticides and the loss of remnant vegetation, but most potently by the likelihood that the honeybee mite, Varroa destructor, will enter the country. Now is the time to prepare for the effect of these changes, and international experience with pollinator decline should serve as a guide. We need to protect and manage our remnant vegetation to protect wild pollinators. Insurance against declining A. mellifera will come through the development of management practices for alternative pollinator species.

Chemical agents currently used for mite control leave contaminating residues and promote pesticide resistance. As an alternative means of control, it would be useful to identify natural substances enabling bees to detect Varroa inside brood cells. These substances could then be used to trigger mite hygienic behaviour by bees. In this study several techniques were used to screen substances that might allow detection of infested brood cells by bees. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was performed on substances extracted in dichloromethane from the contents of brood cells. Solid phase microextraction and solid injection were performed on substances obtained from living and dead Varroa, respectively. Electroantennography was performed to assess the sensitivity of olfactory receptors in bee antennae to some of these substances. Principal component analysis based on proportions of cuticular substances allowed discrimination between bees and other cell contents. Foundress Varroa exhibited the greatest dissimilarity to healthy pupae that were used as controls. Immature Varroa and faecal material were intermediate. High molecular weight compounds, mainly dimethylalkanes, were proportionally the most characteristic components of foundress Varroa. This finding suggests that these compounds would be the most apt to induce uncapping of cells infested by Varroa. Solid-phase microextraction and solid injection demonstrated the presence of aliphatic acids, esters, and one alcohol, eicosenol, in Varroa.

A successful forager performs waggle dances on the surface of the comb where it interacts with nectar receivers and dance followers. A forager uses tremble dance when it experiences difficulty finding a receiver bee to unload food upon return to the hive. A bee colony containing numerous subfamilies may increase its efficiency in dance communication if dances are realized by particular groups of specialized individuals or subfamilies rather than by undifferentiated workers. In this study, we determined the subfamily frequencies of waggle and tremble dancers in a colony headed by a naturally mated queen, where the 17 subfamilies can be identified by microsatellite genetic markers. Our results demonstrate that a genetic component is associated with the dance communication in honeybees. More than half of the waggle dances and the tremble dances were performed by workers from only four subfamilies in each case.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036741085

In an anarchistic colony, many workers' sons are reared in the presence of the queen. Anarchy has previously been described in only two Australian colonies. Here we report on a first detailed genetic analysis of a British anarchistic colony. Male pupae were present in great abundance above the queen excluder, which was clearly indicative of extensive worker reproduction and is the hallmark of anarchy. Seventeen microsatellite loci were used to analyse these male pupae, allowing us to address whether all the males were indeed workers' sons, and how many worker patrilines and individual workers produced them. In the sample, 95 of 96 of the males were definitely workers' sons. Given that ≈ 1% of workers' sons were genetically indistinguishable from queen's sons, this suggests that workers do not move any queen-laid eggs between the part of the colony where the queen is present to the area above the queen excluder which the queen cannot enter. The colony had 16 patrilines, with an effective number of patrilines of 9.85. The 75 males that could be assigned with certainty to a patriline came from 7 patrilines, with an effective number of 4.21. They were the offspring of at least 19 workers. This is in contrast to the two previously studied Australian naturally occurring anarchist colonies, in which most of the workers' sons were offspring of one patriline. The high number of patrilines producing males leads to a low mean relatedness between laying workers and males of the colony. We discuss the importance of studying such colonies in the understanding of worker policing and its evolution.","Anarchy; Apis mellifera; DNA microsatellites; Social insects; Worker policing; Worker reproduction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036718241

We examined the effect of octopamine treatment on responsiveness to brood pheromone (an activator of foraging) and to the presence of older bees in the colony (an inhibitor of foraging in young bees). Octopamine treatment increased responsiveness to brood pheromone and decreased responsiveness to social inhibition. These results identify octopamine both as an important source of variation in response thresholds and as a modulator of pheromonal communication in insect societies.

In honey bees, brood production, and thus colony growth, are controlled by the workers. Thus, we tested for genetic differences between African and European workers in their preference for tasks associated with brood production by monitoring individual African and European workers cross-fostered in common colony environments. We additionally examined differences in the age of transition between tasks (age polyethism). Our data provide strong evidence for genetically based differences in a subset of tasks. African workers were more likely to collect and process pollen, the nutrient source for brood. They initiated pollen foraging at a younger age, but this result was not significant after Bonferroni adjustment. African and European workers showed no difference in brood-care task performance, and did not vary in the age at which they performed brood-care tasks. These data suggest that a significant part of the competitive advantage of this major invasive pest can be traced to a small subset of worker behaviors, those involving resource intake.","Apis mellifera ligustica; Apis mellifera scutellata; Foraging behavior; Genetic differences; Honey bee",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036764736

As an exception to this rule, laying workers of the Cape honeybee, A. m. capensis, parthenogenetically produce diploid female offspring, usually developing into workers and occasionally into queens. Some of such workers can develop into pseudoqueens, which show high ovarial development and a queenlike pheromonal bouquet. Because there is high genetic variance for these characters, this results in an extreme intracolonial selection. This process is governed by a competition for reproductive dominance among workers, leading into a facultative social parasitic reproductive pathway as part of the life history of the Cape honeybee. A. m. capensis workers show an increased potential for invading foreign colonies. Inside of the host colony, parasitic A. m. capensis workers produce queenlike pheromones and swiftly activate the ovaries, despite the presence of a queen. Eventually they establish themselves as pseudoqueens and replace the host queen. The parasitic worker offspring is preferentially fed by the host workers, leading to highly virulent intercastes and thereby completing the social parasitic life cycle of laying A. m. capensis workers. Recently, a particularly virulent parasitic strain of A. m. capensis workers has invaded the neighboring subspecies A. m. scutellata (""capensis calamity""). Because male sexuals are completely lacking in this invasive strain and female reproductives are never reared in infested A. m. scutellata host colonies, this results in reproductive isolation of the parasitic clones from the host gene pool and sets the stage for the evolution of a queenless social parasitic honeybee. The Cape honeybee may therefore constitute a unique subject for studying sympatric speciation of a social parasite.","Apis mellifera capensis; Evolution; Honeybee; Social parasite; Sympatric speciation",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036764716

To assess whether native insects have lower abundance or are excluded in areas that have been colonised by exotic bees, we quantified the abundance, diversity and floral preferences of flower-visiting insects at sites where bumblebees and honeybees were present, and compared them to sites where they were absent. This was achieved by hand searches at 67 sites, and by deploying sticky traps at 122 sites. Honeybees were by far the most abundant bee species overall, and dominated the bee fauna at most sites. There was considerable niche overlap between honeybees, bumblebees and native bees in terms of the flowers that they visited. Sites where bumblebees were established had similar species richness, diversity and abundance of native flower-visiting insects compared to sites where bumblebees were absent. In contrast, native bees were more than three times more abundant at the few sites where honeybees were absent, compared to those where they were present.

The results suggest that total pollen production in these crops may not necessarily reflect total pollen availability to floral visitors (bees). However, of the total amount of pollen actually removed per flower, >57% occurred during the 2 h following flower anthesis of cucumber and muskmelon, and >77% occurred during the 2 h following flower anthesis of watermelon. Thus, most of the accessible pollen was removed shortly after anthesis, which is when these crops are most receptive to pollination. Nonviable triploid and viable diploid watermelon pollen were removed at similar rates (P = 0.4604).

One of the most important greenhouse crops that benefit from honey bee pollination is sweet pepper, Capsicum annuum. However, colonies placed inside sweet pepper greenhouses deteriorate quickly, resulting in reduced pollination activity and eventually need for replacement. We tested whether honey bee colonies kept in enclosures of sweet pepper suffer from nutritional deficiencies by following their food reserves and brood production. In both years of the study, colonies not supplemented with a protein diet deteriorated during the 68-day (1999) and 88-day (2000) duration of the study. Colonies that were given pollen supplements (500 g per week) maintained a high level of brood production. Levels of sealed brood provided the most informative measure of the efficacy of the supplementary feedings. As the winter progresses, sweet pepper flowers produce fewer pollen grains and with reduced viability, and thus greater pollinator activity is needed. We show that by feeding pollen supplements, colonies maintained in enclosures of sweet pepper over the long flowering period of the crop, can sustain stable levels of brood production, which are needed for achieving efficient pollination.","Apis mellifera; Brood; Capsicum annuum; Enclosures; Greenhouse; Honey bees; Pollen supplement; Pollination; Sweet pepper",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036738356

This article first presents the likelihood of observing different classes of paternal haplotypes in a half-sib family, where only family members of a certain phenotype (e.g., affected) are genotyped and are fully informative. The likelihood function is then generalized to multiple phenotypic categories. A linear predictor allows for discontinuous as well as for continuous phenotypes and other explanatory variables. Finally, how to incorporate not fully informative offspring and how to analyze super sister families are shown. Maximum-likelihood estimates of all parameters can be found by a Newton-Raphson algorithm, which mimics an iteratively weighted least-squares procedure. The method allows for any multilocus feasible mapping function and, among others, for situations with selective or nonselective genotyping, single or multiple traits, and continuous or categorical traits. No parameters are required to describe the mode of inheritance and the method copes with virtually any family size. Fields of applications are therefore mapping experiments in species with a high reproductive capacity, such as cattle, pigs, horses, honey bees, trees, and fish.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036742549

As the neural structures involved in the detection and integration of CS and US are bilaterally symmetrical in the bee brain, we ask what respective role each brain side plays in the conditioning process. More specifically, the US normally used in conditioning experiments is the compound stimulation of the antennae (which triggers the PER) and of the proboscis (where bees lick the sucrose solution). Anatomically, the brain receives unilateral US input through each antenna, but bilateral input from the proboscis. By controlling each US component, we show that an antenna-US produces unilateral sensitization, whereas a proboscis-US or a compound-US induces bilateral sensitization. Bees can learn a unilateral odor CS with all three USs, but when a proboscis-US is used, new learning is inhibited on the contralateral side, owing to a possible US-preexposure effect. Furthermore, we show that the antenna-US induces both unilateral and bilateral reinforcement processes, whereas the proboscis-US produces only bilateral effects.

They can associate, with a landmark, a memory that encodes the direction and distance of the path segment between that landmark and the next. The expression of the memory results in the performance of a local vector matching the distance and direction of the path segment. The memories of path segments appear to be 'chained' together, so that the performance of one local vector is sometimes sufficient to elicit the subsequent local vector, even in the absence of the associated landmark. We have investigated the effect of visual panoramic context on the expression of local vectors. Bees were trained to fly along a narrow channel to collect sucrose from a feeder positioned partway along it. Panoramic context was provided by various types of patterning on the walls. The channel was partitioned into different segments using landmarks of two kinds: a boundary landmark that marked a change in the pattern on one or both side-walls of the channel, and an isolated landmark, consisting of a baffle through which the bee passed, for which the wall pattern was the same before as after. In tests, we removed the feeder and analysed the search distribution of the bees for various arrangements of landmarks. Altering the spatial relationship between landmarks has different consequences for the two types of landmark. If the final boundary landmark is shifted, the centre of the search distribution shifts by approximately the same amount. Changes in the position of an isolated landmark have a weaker effect. In the absence of the final context, the search is disrupted. We suggest that for local vectors to be expressed the surrounding panoramic context needs to be appropriate. A comparison of search patterns from two different training configurations of landmarks supports the hypothesis that local vector memories merely encode route segments and that global positional coordinates are not linked to landmark memories.","Apis mellifera; Honeybee; Landmark; Local vector; Navigation; Panoramic context",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036335629

Following feeding, they were dissected after fixed periods of time in order to measure crop content and haemolymph sugar titers. Between feeding and dissection, the metabolic rate of every investigated forager was measured using open-flow respirometry, so as to assess the effects of both food quality (concentration, molarity and viscosity of the fed sugar solution) and food quantity on the transport rate through the proventriculus. The sugar transport rate through the proventriculus was observed to be mainly dependent on the metabolic expenditure of the individual. Bee foragers were able to precisely adjust the sugar transport rate to their metabolic rates, but under certain conditions, an excess of sugars was transported through the proventriculus, more than needed to cover the bee's energetic demands. This excess depended on the nutritive value and quantity of the fed sugar solution, and on the time after feeding. It did not depend on the metabolic rate of the bee, the molarity, or the viscosity of the fed sugar solution. As long as the bees did not exhaust their crop contents, the haemolymph sugar titers were unaffected by this excess amount transported, by the time after feeding, the concentration and the viscosity of the fed sugar solution. For all feeding conditions assayed, the haemolymph trehalose titer remained constant, while the titers of other haemolymph sugars varied. It is suggested that the trehalose concentration in the haemolymph is regulated in honeybees, and that it represents the controlled variable in the feedback loop responsible for the transport rate through the proventriculus. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Some species are limited by a lack of suitable pollinators, but the introduction of exotic pollinators can facilitate rapid spread. In Tasmania, where many non-native plants are naturalised, exotic honeybees (Apis mellifera) and bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) have become established. We determined how these species affect the pollination of Lupinus arboreus, an invasive, nitrogen-fixing shrub, which is rarely visited by native pollinators. The proportion of flowers setting seed and the number of ovules fertilised per flower were positively related to the visitation rates of both exotic bee species. There was no effect of bee visitation rates on the proportion of seeds aborted prior to maturity, possibly due to post-fertilisation environmental constraints. We conclude that the spread of B. terrestris may not alter the fecundity of L. arboreus because of the pollination service provided by A. mellifera, and discuss potential interactions between these two bee species. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

(Sapotaceae), and to examine pollination efficiency of birds and honey bees. Location: An upland heath area on the island of Mauritius, Indian Ocean. Methods: We quantified visitation rates of endemic birds and introduced honey bees at two endemic species of flowering trees. Diurnal variation in nectar standing crop and nectar production was measured. Pollination efficiency of flower visitors was examined using bagging and caging experiments. Results: White-eyes were only nectar-feeding at the two Sideroxylon species early in the morning, stopping when honey bee foraging activity rapidly lowered nectar standing crops. White-eyes continued nectar-feeding at other flowering plant species, exploited less by honey bees, throughout the day. Honey bees were less efficient pollinators of the two Sideroxylon species than white-eyes. Main conclusions: Our results indicate that introduced honey bees could be interfering with endemic interactions between the two Sideroxylon species and the two white-eye species. However, because of lack of a neutral control site without honey bees, we cannot exclude other explanations. We do recommend, although, that honey bees need to be taken into consideration in the future conservation management of Mauritian ecosystems. We suggest that island ecosystems are especially vulnerable to introduced honey bees.","Apis mellifera; Bird pollination; Conservation; Interspecific competition; Sideroxylon; Zosterops",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036331880

We found that 27% of the experienced foragers had no contact with the returning foragers inside the hive. The most common interactions were dance following (64%) and trophallaxis (21%). The great variability found in the amount of interactions suggests that individual bees require different stimulation before changing to the foraging mode.

The (composite) clone, named Acmar1, was 1,378 bp long, and encoded 336 amino acids corresponding to a transposase-like putative polypeptide in a single open reading frame. The P,D(34)D motif, the catalytic domain of the mariner transposase, was present, although there was a deletion of five amino acid residues within it as compared with the active transposase in Drosophila mauritiona. Nineteen-bp-long imperfect inverted terminal repeat-like sequences flanked by TA dinucleotides, the typical target site for mariner insertion, were observed. Southern blot analysis using a fragment covering two-thirds of the Acmar1 transposase coding sequence as a probe indicated the presence of multiple Akmar1-like elements in the genome. Maximum-parsimony phylogenetic analysis based on the transposase amino acid sequences of insect mariner-like elements revealed that Acmar1 is a member of the mellifero subfamily. © 2002 Wiley-liss, Inc.","Apis cerana japonica; Hymenoptera; Mariner; Transposon",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036675853

RFLP analyses were simplified by restricting the amplifications to sections, within each locus, that contained most of the informative polymorphic sites. AluI digests of locus L-1 section 2 (L-1S2) revealed three suballeles of which one was African-specific (Apis mellifera scutellata Lepeletier) and one was east European-predominant (A. m. ligustica Spinola, A. m. carnica Pollman, and A. m. caucasica Gorbachev). Alleles found originally at locus L-2 with AvaI were determined in RFLP analysis of two sections, L-2S1int and L-2S2, resulting in two African-specific and two east European-predominant suballeles. Suballele identity was determined by the combination of banding patterns from both fragments. Polymorphisms revealed by HaeIII in locus L-2 were analyzed in amplifications and digests of L-2S1int, an 830 bp fragment within L-2S1. Seven suballeles were found of which two were African-specific and three were east European-specific or predominant, including one suballele specific to the east European subspecies A. m. caucasica. In locus L-5, RFLPs were detected with HaeIII, DdeI, and SpeI. HaeIII polymorphisms were analyzed by amplification and digestion of fragments L-5S1xt and L-5S1ter. Five suballeles were found of which three were African-specific and one east European-predominant.

In order to understand how such changes may have evolved, we analyzed the pupal ecdysteroid titers in two closely related, highly social bees: the honey bee, Apis mellifera, and a stingless bee, Melipona quadrifasciata. In both species, the ecdysteroid titers in queens reached their peak levels earlier than in workers. Titer levels at peak maxima did not differ for the honey bee castes, but in Melipona they were twofold higher in queens than in workers. During the second half of pupal development, when the ecdysteroid titers decrease and the cuticle progressively melanizes, the titer in honey bee queens remained higher than in workers, while the reverse situation was observed in Melipona. Application of the juvenile hormone analog Pyriproxyfen® to spinning-stage larvae of Melipona induced queen development. Endocrinologically this was manifest in a queen-like profile of the pupal ecdysteroid titer. Comparing these data with previous results on preimaginal hormone titers in another stingless bee, we conclude that the timing and height of the pupal ecdysteroid peak may depend on the nature of the specific stimuli that initially trigger diverging queen/worker development. In contrast, the interspecific differences in the late pupal ecdysteroid titer profiles mainly seem to be related to caste-specific programs in tissue differentiation, including cuticle pigmentation. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Free-flying bees were trained to discriminate concentric patterns in a Y-maze. The rewarded pattern could be composed of either a cyan and a yellow colour, which presented both different chromatic and achromatic L-receptor contrast, or an orange and a blue colour, which presented different chromatic cues, but the same L-receptor contrast. The non-rewarded alternative was either a single-coloured disc with the colour of the central disc or the surrounding ring of the pattern, a checkerboard pattern with non-resolvable squares, the reversed pattern, or the elements of the training pattern (disc or ring alone). Bees resolved and learned both colour elements in the rewarded patterns and their spatial properties. When the patterns subtended large visual angles, this discrimination used chromatic cues only. Patterns with yellow or orange central discs were generalised toward the yellow and orange colours, respectively. When the patterns subtended a visual angle close to the detection limit and L-receptor contrast was mediating discrimination, pattern perception was reduced: bees perceived only the pattern element with higher contrast.","Colour vision; Compound eye; Honeybee; Pattern vision",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036707349

During a study of the stability of homing information over time, we noticed that honey bees held at a feeding place for several hours sometimes headed not in the homeward compass direction on their release, but in the reverse compass direction. This behavior suggested that the path integration system had been reset to a state corresponding to an outward flight to the food. Most models of insect navigation assume that it is the experience of reaching home that resets the path integration system, enabling the activation of vectors appropriate for subsequent outbound foraging trips. Here we provide evidence that this resetting can be influenced by motivational cues associated with food deprivation.

Happily, things are not totally gloomy in the degenerative domain: many Corporate Caterpillars have the potential for transformation, as do at least some Corporate Locusts. The strategies appropriate to these two different domains, and four types of wealth creation, are diverse. A key question in each case is how the process of transformation to more sustainable forms of wealth creation can be triggered, steered and valued. The need to digest old, unsustainable structures and create new structures is a major challenge, both in the worlds of insect and economic metamorphosis. The challenge is made harder when you have to do it in the same space at the same time - as both insects and corporations must.

Bees can also be conditioned differentially: They learn to respond to a reinforced odor and not to a nonreinforced one. They can also learn to reverse their choice. Here we ask whether honeybees can learn successive olfactory differential conditioning tasks involving different overlapping pairs of odors. The conditioning schedules were established in order to train the animals with 3, 2, 1, or 0 reversals previous to a last differential conditioning phase in which two additional reversals were present. We studied whether or not successive reversal learning is possible and whether or not learning olfactory discrimination reversals affects the solving of subsequent discrimination reversals. Therefore we compared the responses of bees that had experienced reversals with those of bees that had not experienced such reversals when both are confronted with a new reversal situation. In experiment 1 we showed that bees that had experienced three previous reversals were better in solving the final reversal task than bees with no previous reversal experience. In experiment 2, we showed that one reversal learning is enough for bees to perform better in the final reversal task. The successive different reversals trained in our experiments resemble the natural foraging situation in which a honeybee forager has to switch successively from an initial floral species to different ones.

Following feeding, bees were injected either with metabolisable (glucose, fructose, trehalose), or non-metabolisable (sorbose) sugars, in order to distinguish between haemolymph osmolarity and haemolymph sugar levels as factors controlling the solution transport rates through the proventriculus. After a fixed period, workers were dissected in order to measure crop content and haemolymph sugar titers. Between feeding and dissection, the metabolic rate of every investigated forager was measured using open-flow respirometry. Bees injected with metabolisable sugars 15 min after feeding were observed to reduce their solution transport rates through the proventriculus, but injection of non-metabolisable sugars had no influence on them. This suggests that the solution transport rate through the proventriculus is controlled by the concentration of metabolisable compounds in the haemolymph, and not by the haemolymph osmolarity. A period of 10 min after injection of metabolisable sugars was enough to observe reduced solution transport rates. However, if bees were injected only 5 min after feeding, no reduced solution transport rates were observed 10 min after injection. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We tested the sex locus hypothesis for the evolution of polyandry in honey bees (Apis mellifera). A queen may produce infertile, diploid males that reduce the viability of worker brood and, presumably, adversely affect colony fitness. Polyandry reduces the variance in diploid male production within a colony and may increase queen fitness if there are non-linear costs associated with brood viability, specifically if the relationship between brood viability and colony fitness is concave. We instrumentally inseminated queens with three of their own brothers to vary brood viability from 50% to 100% among colonies. We measured the colonies during three stages of their development: (1) colony initiation and growth, (2) winter survival, and (3) spring reproduction. We found significant relationships between brood viability and most colony measures during the growth phase of colonies, but the data were too variable to distinguish significant non-linear effects. However, there was a significant step function of brood viability on winter survival, such that all colonies above 72% brood viability survived the winter but only 37.5% of the colonies below 72% viability survived. We discuss the significance of this and other ""genetic diversity"" hypotheses for the evolution of polyandry.","Mating systems; Polyandry; Sex determination; Social insects",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036664279

Twenty social parasitic workers were sampled from both of two infested A. m. scutellata colonies at two distant apiaries (Graskop and Heilbronn, about 390 km apart) and compared with data obtained from 80 colonies in four different geographical zones (zone I: thelytokous A. m. capensis morphocluster; zone II: natural thelytokous hybrids between A. m. capensis and A. m. scutellata; zone III: thelytokous A. m. scutellata morphocluster; zone IV: an arrhenotokous A. m. scutellata morphocluster). Thelytokous laying workers occur naturally in zones I-III. Highly significant morphometric differences were found among the bees in the four zones. The data support the conclusion that the social parasitic workers belong to the thelytokous A. m. capensis morphocluster. It is most likely that the social parasitic workers originated from the heart of the Cape bee's distribution range in the Western Cape region in zone I. Morphometric analysis makes it feasible to restrict the possible origin of the social parasitic workers from the natural distribution range of thelytoky (approximately 240 000 km2) down to about 12 000 km2, which represents a resolution capacity of about 95%.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036630017

Recent molecular biological studies have shown that a large number of genes in insects and other organisms are coding for olfactory receptor proteins. In general, one receptor type seems to be expressed in each neurone. The functional characterisations of olfactory receptor neurones have been extensive in certain insect species, demonstrating a fine-tuning of single neurones to biologically relevant odourants; both insect and plant produced volatiles. Stained neurones of the same functional type have been shown to project in one and the same glomerular unit in the primary olfactory centre, the antennal lobe. This corresponds to molecular biological studies, showing projections in one glomerulus by neurones expressing the same receptor type. Comparison of these findings with physiological and morphological characterisations of antennal lobe neurones has indicated correspondence between input and output of the glomerular units. Examples are presented from studies of heliothine moths. From the antennal lobe, the olfactory information is further conveyed to the mushroom bodies, particularly important for learning, and the lateral protocerebrum, a premotoric area. The three brain areas are regions of synaptic plasticity important in learning of odours, which is well studied in the honeybee but also in species of moths.","Antennal lobe neurons; Chemical communication; Heliothine moths; Insects; Olfaction; Olfactory coding; Olfactory receptor neurones; Ordinary glomeruli",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036665094

In contrast, European honey bees (EHBs: Apis mellifera carnica) at the same tropical study site are highly intolerant to these ectoparasites. A lower attractiveness of Varroa-tolerant AHB larvae has been hypothesised to be an important trait in reducing the susceptibitlity of AHBs to these mites. Thus, selection for EHB brood that is less attractive to mites is thought to be one possibility for limiting mite population growth and thus increase the tolerance of EHBs to the mite. In Ribeirão Preto, Brazil, European A. m. carnica bees and AHBs were tested with respect to their rate of brood infestation and brood attractiveness to Varroa mites. For the comparison of brood infestation rates, we introduced combs with pieces of EHB and AHB brood into honey bee colonies (18 repetitions). The relative infestation rate of EHB brood was significantly higher compared to AHB brood. The preference behaviour of single Varroa mites was tested in a laboratory bioassay where either living host stages were offered or host extracts were presented on dummies. By these tests we could confirm the preference of Varroa females for certain developmental host stages and for their corresponding extracts. In contrast to the within-colony results, Varroa mites in the laboratory bioassay showed a slight preference for AHB compared to EHB larvae. The gas chromatographic analysis revealed differences in the chemical spectrum of extracts obtained from different larvae. In accord with the results of the bioassays, we could detect stage-specific odour differences in larval cuticular compounds, including methyl esters and hydrocarbons that have been described as kairomones. None of these substances, however, revealed significant race-specific differences. Therefore, the quantity and composition of certain cuticular compounds seem to be responsible only for the recognition of a suitable host stage by Varroa females. The different infestation rates in the colonies, however, seem to be caused neither by race-specific differences in attractiveness of bee larvae nor by an extended attractive period of EHB larvae: both AHB and EHB larvae become attractive approximately 21 h before capping of the brood cell, and thus have the same window of time when they can be parasitised. Therefore differential Varroa-infestation rates are not related to larval attraction but probably are determined by other race-specific and colony-related factors.","Africanized honey bee; Apis mellifera carnica; Bee brood infestation; Bioassay; Host-finding cues; Larval cuticular volatiles; Semiochemical; Varroa mites",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036270170

Intracellular recordings were used to address the question whether neuroanatomical features affect odor-coding properties. We found that neurons in the median antennocerebral tract code odors by latency differences or specific inhibitory phases in combination with excitatory phases, have a more specific activity profile for different odors and convey the information with a delay. The neurons of the lateral antennocerebral tract code odors by spike rate differences, have a broader activity profile for different odors, and convey the information quickly. Thus, rather preliminary information about the olfactory stimulus first reaches the mushroom bodies and the lateral horn via neurons of the lateral antennocerebral tract and subsequently odor information becomes more specified by activities of neurons of the median antennocerebral tract.

Little is known about the major antigenic sites on PR3. To facilitate epitope mapping, PR3 was cloned in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. Four different sequences of the PR3 cDNA were amplified by PCR: two clones containing the pro-peptide of PR3 with or without a His-tag (rproPR3-his and rproPR3, respectively) and two clones without the pro-peptide and with or without a His-tag (rPR3-his and rPR3, respectively). The PR3 sequences were cloned behind the polyhedrin promoter and the honeybee melittin signal peptide enabling secretion of rPR3. Plasmids were transposed into the genome of baculovirus, and wild types as well as PR3-containing virus genomes were transfected into Sf21 insect cells. All four rPR3 variants were secreted into the medium and were recognized by anti-neutrophil PR3 rabbit serum and by at least two anti-PR3 monoclonal antibodies. Mature forms of PR3 were recognized by almost all patient sera, whereas the pro-forms of PR3 were recognized by 14 of 18 PR3-ANCA sera tested. On SDS-PAGE, the four rPR3 forms migrated at approximately 32 kDa. RPR3-his and rproPR3-his could be purified by means of this His-tag. In conclusion, especially the mature rPR3s are well recognized by PR3-ANCA sera. The presence of a C-terminal His-tag facilitated purification of His-tagged rPR3. Thus, rPR3 expressed in insect cells can be used as a tool for diagnostic tests as well as for epitope mapping studies. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This series of experiments examined the ability of bees to detect and discriminate among the floral odors of different varieties of two species of canola (Brassica rapa and Brassica napus) and also among three varieties of snapdragons (Antirhinnum majus). Individual worker honeybees were trained using a proboscis extension assay. The ability of bees to distinguish a floral odor from an air stimulus during training increased as the number of flowers used during training increased. Bees conditioned to the odor of one variety of flower were asked to discriminate it from the odors of other flowers in two different training assays. Bees were unable to discriminate among flowers at the level of variety in a randomized presentation of a reinforced floral odor and an unreinforced floral odor. In the second type of assay, bees were trained with one floral variety for 40 trials without reinforcement and then tested with the same variety or with other varieties and species. If a bee had been trained with a variety of canola, it was unable to differentiate the odor of one canola flower from the odor of other canola flowers, but it could differentiate canola from the odor of a snapdragon flower. Bees trained with the odor of snapdragon flowers readily differentiated the odor of one variety of a snapdragon from the odor of other varieties of snapdragons and also canola flowers. Our study suggests that both intensity and odor quality affect the ability of honeybees to differentiate among floral perfumes.","Antirhinnum majus; Apis mellifera; Brassica napus; Brassica rapa; Floral odors; Honeybee; Olfactory learning; Proboscis extension assay",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035987159

Its effect on the process of colon carcinogenesis and DNA damage were evaluated in the male Wistar rats using the aberrant crypt foci (ACF) assay and the comet assay, respectively. For both tests, animals were treated with the colon carcinogen 1,2 dimethylhydrazine (DMH, 40 mg/kg, s.c.) for 2 weeks (two injections/week) in order to induce both DNA damage and ACF. The animals were divided into groups that received propolis (ethanolic extract) at three different doses (10, 30, and 90 mg/kg b.w., by gavage), either simultaneously or after DMH treatment. For the comet assay, peripheral blood samples were collected 4 h after the last DMH treatment. All animals were sacrificed at the 5th week for evaluation of ACF. The results show that only the intermediate dose (30 mg/kg) of propolis, administered after DMH initiation, is significantly associated to a smaller number of aberrant crypts in the distal colon. No effect on DNA damage in peripheral blood cells, however, was verified by the comet assay.

Our results are consistent with Rinderer and Beaman (1995) in that inheritance of the transition point from round dancing → waggle dancing is consistent with control by a single locus with more than one allele. That is, we found one dance type to be dominant in the F1, and observed a 1:1 segregation of dance in a backcross involving the F1 and the recessive parent.

Here, we analyzed the effects of landscape context on the distribution of bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) at multiple spatial scales with respect to the following hypotheses: (1) Local abundance and diversity of bees increase with increasing proportion of the surrounding seminatural habitats. (2) Solitary wild bees, bumble bees, and honey bees respond to landscape context at different spatial scales. We selected 15 landscape sectors and determined the percentage of seminatural habitats and the diversity of habitat types at eight spatial scales (radius 250-3000 m) by field inspections and analyses of vegetation maps using two Geographic Information Systems. The percentage of seminatural habitats varied between 1.4% and 28%. In the center of each landscape sector a patch of potted flowering plants (four perennial and two annual species) was placed in the same habitat type, a grassy field margin adjacent to cereal fields. In all, 865 wild bee individuals and 467 honey bees were observed and an additional 475 individuals were caught for species identification. Species richness and abundance of solitary wild bees showed a close positive correlation with the percentage of seminatural habitats at small scales up to 750 m, whereas bumble bees and honey bees did not respond to landscape context at these scales. In contrast, honey bees were correlated with landscape context at large scales. The densities of flower-visiting honey bees even increased with decreasing proportion of seminatural habitats at a radius of 3000 m. We are not aware of any empirical studies showing contrasting foraging patterns related to landscape context at different spatial scales. We conclude (1) that local landscape destruction affects solitary wild bees more than social bees, possibly changing mutualistic plant-pollinator and competitive wild bees-honey bees interactions and (2) that only analyses of multiple spatial scales may detect the importance of the landscape context for local pollinator communities.","Bees; Biotic interactions; Community structure; Connectivity; Habitat fragmentation; Landscape ecology; Pollination; Spatial scales; Species diversity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0010539443

Here we report how this model has been expanded and show how, through self-organization, three colony-level phenomena can emerge: symmetry breaking, cross inhibition and the equal harvest-rate distribution. Symmetry breaking is the phenomenon that the numbers of foragers visiting two equally profitable food sources will diverge after some time. Cross inhibition is the phenomenon that, by increasing the profitability of one of two equal food sources, the number of foragers visiting the other source will decrease. In some circumstances, the bees foraging on two sources of different profitabilities will be distributed between these sources such that the two average energy harvest rates are equal. We will refer to this phenomenon as the equal harvest-rate distribution. For each of these three phenomena, we show what the necessary behavioural rules to be followed by the individual forager bees are, and what the necessary circumstances are (that is, what values the model parameters should take) in order for these phenomena to arise.

Experimenting with two types of currency, net gain rate and net gain efficiency, revealed that only gain rate may result in an equal harvest-rate distribution of foragers visiting different food sources.","Collective foraging; Communication; Honeybee; Individual-oriented model; Self-organization",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036589925

The eusocial corbiculate bee tribes comprise the Apini (honey bees), Bombini (bumble bees), and Meliponini (stingless bees). Honey bee foragers (Apis) transfer nectar to receiver bees within the nest. This is an example of task partitioning, in which a task is split into sub-tasks connected by material transfer. Nectar transfer does not occur in Bombini. Although it is reported in some species of Meliponini, it has not been subject to detailed study. 2. Nectar transfer was investigated in five genera of Meliponini from Yucatan, Mexico (Melipona, Trigona, Scaptotrigona, Nannotrigona, and Plebeia). Nectar transfer occurred in all species and for > 99% of foragers. Multiple transfer, in which a forager unloads nectar to more than one receiver, occurred but at a lower level than in Apis. In M. beecheii, multiple transfer was associated strongly with putative recruitment dances. 3. The data provide some support for the hypothesis that task partitioning is favoured by large colony size, in that the Meliponini never have small colonies because colonies are swarm founded. This ensures that colonies are always large enough to prevent delays in finding a transfer partner imposing high costs. Further tests of this hypothesis are suggested. 4. Viewed in a phylogenetic context, the most parsimonious interpretation is that nectar transfer evolved once in the clade (Apini + Meliponini).","Foraging; Melipona; Meliponini; Nannotrigona; Nectar transfer; Plebeia; Scaptotrigona; Task partitioning; Trigona",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036225225

Allelic variation causes alternative behavioral phenotypes, whereas changes in gene expression can influence the initiation of behavior at different ages. We show that the age-related transition by honey bees from hive work to foraging is associated with an increase in the expression of the foraging (for) gene, which encodes a guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKG). cGMP treatment elevated PKG activity and caused foraging behavior.

One example is the maintenance of pollen stores in the nest by honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). To adjust pollen intake in an appropriate manner, individual foragers must assess the colony's need for pollen. This assessment could be done either directly, through physical contact with larvae and stored pollen, or indirectly, using information obtained from other bees in the colony. We investigated the mechanisms by which foragers assess their colony's need for pollen. We segregated foragers from non-foragers using either a single screen that permitted contact between the two groups of bees, or a double screen that prevented contact. We supplied the segregated foragers in colonies of both of the screen treatment groups with either a comb containing 300 g pollen (P+) or a comb without pollen (P-). To create a need for pollen in the non-forager compartment of each colony, we provided that compartment with combs bearing 3-5 d old larvae but without any pollen. Foragers on combs with pollen returned 3.5% of the time with pollen, while foragers on combs without pollen returned with pollen 20.7% of the time (P < 0.005). Foragers able to contact their non-foraging nestmates through a single screen (S1) returned with pollen 12.6% of the time, while foragers prevented from contacting nestmates by a double screen (S2) returned with pollen loads 11.7% of the time (P > 0.80). The interaction between the pollen and screen treatments was not significant. These results suggest that foragers adjust their foraging behavior based on their direct assessment of the amount of pollen stored in the colony, and that non-foragers do not provide an excitatory indirect stimulus to foragers.","Apis; Direct assessment; Honey bees; Pollen foraging; Regulatory mechanism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036216403

The maternity of drones of the giant honey bee A. dorsata (n = 660) was determined using DNA microsatellite analysis. None carried markers from the queen's mates indicating that none was a worker's son. In addition, dissection of 1,902 workers from 8 colonies showed that none had activated ovaries indicating that worker sterility is usual. Worker policing behavior involves costs when police workers make errors: removing eggs laid by a queen or failing to remove worker-laid eggs. We develop a model that examines the effect of these costs on the acceptance threshold of eggs. The model shows that costs may be reduced by any cues that help police workers distinguish worker-laid and queen-laid eggs. Once such cue may be the use of unique cells for rearing drones and workers. Unlike other Apis, A. dorsata rear both workers and drones in the same-size cells with the drone brood scattered among worker brood. Thus, the ability of A. dorsata workers to detect and eliminate (police) worker-laid eggs may be associated with higher costs than in other species. Our model suggests that these higher costs may select for a more permissive egg-acceptance threshold, because of the costs of erroneously removing queen-laid eggs, leading to greater worker reproduction. However our empirical results suggest that worker reproduction is very low in the species, suggesting that worker policing is efficient and that police workers have no difficulty in distinguishing queen-laid and worker-laid eggs.","Apis dorsata; Ovary activation; Worker policing; Worker sterility",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036220827

Several daughter queens are raised in the original nest, and these start to emerge shortly after the first swarm departs. One or several of these daughter queens may then leave the original colony sequentially with smaller afterswarms. Here we study the change in acceptance of former nestmates after colony reproduction using free-flying honey bee colonies. We used a total of four colonies each of which we divided to make four new colonies: two artificial swarms (the offspring colonies) and two colonies that mimic established ('old') colonies after swarming. The way the original (mother) colonies were divided allowed us to determine the relative importance of wax comb on cue divergence. Half of the divisions contained the original wax combs from the mother colony whereas the other divisions were not provided with comb requiring them to construct their own. We then tested the acceptance of former nestmates by introducing foragers at the hive entrances and observing the behaviour of guard bees. Our results did not show a consistent change in acceptance of former nestmates after swarming. In two out of four replicates, workers originating from the colonies that contained the original wax combs were rejected by guards from the initially comb-less colonies. This suggests that comb wax plays an important role in nestmate recognition. However, the remaining two replicates did not show a response; all former nesmates were still accepted two weeks after artificial swarming.","Apis mellifera; Honey bees; Nestmate recognition; Swarming",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036217431

We determined whether starvation affects worker-worker interactions by quantifying the frequencies of five social interactions (trophallaxis, begging, offering, antennating, and grooming) in colonies that either were starved or well-fed. We hypothesized that bees in starved colonies engage in fewer social interactions than bees in colonies with ample food stores. In all three trials, starved colonies had significantly greater numbers of foragers than well-fed colonies, as in a previous study. In three of three trials, starved bees showed a significantly higher frequency of begging behavior than well-fed bees. Begging in starved colonies increased exponentially with time as the starvation presumably grew more severe. Immediately following the onset of foraging in starved colonies, the frequency of begging declined dramatically. No consistent differences for other observed social behaviors were found. Our results under starvation conditions do not provide support for the hypothesis that precocious forager development must be associated with a decrease in social interactions. Perhaps factors that influence precocious foraging under starvation conditions differ from those under conditions of ample food stores.

It was shown that both self- and cross-pollination can set fruits in cashew, but most of fruits originating from self-pollination are shed 9-15 d after pollination, and fruits harvested are primarily from cross-pollination. Honey bees display foraging behaviour in cashew orchards conducive to cross-pollination, but in plantations originating from clonal material they failed to increase fruit yield despite cashew's dependence on insect pollination. It is concluded that cashew has a mechanism of selective abortion through which it discards self-pollinated fruits and that honey bees can contribute to increased fruit yield only when cashew trees of genetically diverse origin are found in the same orchard.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036218831

The social behavior of insects is a result of complex interactions at different levels of biological organization. Genes give rise to proteins and peptides that build the nervous and muscular systems, regulate their own synthesis, interact with each other, and affect the behavior of individuals. Social behavior emerges from the complex interactions of individuals that are themselves far removed from the direct effects of the genes. In order to understand how social organization evolves, we must understand the mechanisms that link the different levels of organization. In this review, we discuss how behavior is influenced by genes and the neural system and how social behavior emerges from the behavioral activities of individuals. We show how different levels of organization share common features and are linked through common mechanisms.

How the control of pollen collection is achieved is still unclear. Different feedback mechanisms have been proposed but little is known about the experience of pollen foragers in the hive. A detailed documentation of the behavior of pollen foragers in the hive under different pollen need conditions is presented here. Taking a broad observational approach, we analyze the behavior of individual pollen foragers in the hive between collecting trips and quantify the different variables constituting the in-hive stay. Comparing data from two colonies and 143 individuals during experimentally induced times of low vs. times of high pollen need, we show that individual foragers modulate their in-hive working tempo according to the actual pollen need of the colony: pollen foragers slowed down and stayed in the hive longer when pollen need was low and spent less time in the hive between foraging trips when pollen need by their colony was high. Furthermore, our data show a significant change in the trophallactic experience of pollen foragers with changing pollen need conditions of their colony. Pollen foragers had more short (< 3 s) trophallactic contacts when pollen need was high, resulting in an increase of total number of trophallactic contacts. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that trophallactic experience is one of the various information pathways used by pollen foragers to assess their colony's pollen need.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036123782

We caged a queen in a specific area of empty combs inside the broodnest and filmed nursing episodes within this area. We created 5-day observation periods with and without artificial rain, as well as periods with and without manual reduction of pollen stores and reduction of pollen income. In rain periods, there were significantly fewer nursing episodes for young larvae (1-3 days old) than in no-rain periods. The nursing frequency was significantly correlated with the amount of pollen in the hive, as well as with the total amount of unsealed larvae. The ratio of available pollen to larvae had the strongest influence on the nursing frequency: the more pollen available per larva, the higher the nursing frequency of young larvae. Higher nursing frequency, as well as a longer total duration of nursing episodes, resulted in a higher protein content of the larvae. In contrast, the frequency of nursing of older larvae (4 days old) did not depend on the amount of pollen or on the ratio of pollen to larvae, even after some days of severe pollen reduction. The amount of honey stores and the weight of the hive were not correlated with the nursing frequency of any larval age group. When pollen becomes scarce, older larvae receive preferential treatment.

To characterize and evaluate the ecological and reproductive features of wild soybean (Glycine soja Sieb. et Zucc.), which is the most probable ancestor of cultivated soybean (G. max (L) Merr.), the breeding system and genetic diversity of G. soja were investigated. The extent of natural cross-pollination of G. soja was estimated in four populations along the Omono River in Akita Prefecture, Japan by examining allozyme variation. Although it has been previously believed that G. soja is autogamous, as is cultivated soybean, the mean multilocus outcrossing rate (tm) estimate was 13%. These values are much higher than the outcrossing rate previously reported for both G. soja and G. max. Frequent visits by honeybees and carpenter bees to flowers were also observed, which supported this conjecture. Furthermore, to evaluate the genetic variation of G. soja as a genetic resource, the genetic structure of 447 populations over Japan were analyzed. Wild soybean populations had a higher degree of variation of isozyme loci. The GST coefficient of gene differentian values among the sites within the district were particularly high, revealing that the isozyme genotype was greatly different among site populations and homogeneous within the sites. The genetic differentiation among nine districts was observed in the allele frequencies of a few loci, indicating that geographic isolation in the wild soybean population was effectively created through the distance between the districts. The difference in the allele frequency among the districts may be produced under genetic drift. Finally, the importance of the preservation of natural plant populations and the habitats of wild progenitors (i.e. the in situ conservation of plant genetic resources) was emphasized.","Breeding system; Genetic diversity; Genetic resources; Glycine soja; Wild soybean",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036547517

DNA sequencing yielded a contig of 21.5 kb spanning the honeybee IP3K locus and a 3′ flanking gene similar to a transcription factor NFR-κ-B. The IP3K locus gives rise to three differentially expressed major transcripts produced by alternative splicing that encode proteins with identical, highly conserved C-termini and distinct, non-conserved N-terminal domains. The type A transcript is dominant in the adult brain and its level of expression increases threefold during the first 4 days of adult development. The type B message is expressed in brains of naive bees, but is also found in the thorax and abdomen, whereas transcript C is expressed largely in non-neural tissues and in the antenna.

While various mechanisms underlying insect navigation have been thoroughly explored, little is yet known about the degree of integration of spatial parameters to form higher-level spatial representations. In this paper we explore the basic interactions between landmark cues and directional cues, which stand at the basis of our understanding of piloting mechanisms. A novel experimental paradigm allowed us independent manipulation of each parameter in a highly controlled environment. The approach taken was twofold: cue-conflict experiments were first conducted to examine the interactions between positional cues and directional cues. The bees were then successively deprived of sensory cues to question the dependence of landmark navigation on context cues. Our results confirm previous findings that landmark cues are used in concert with external directional cues if present. Conversely, the bees' ability to locate a food site was not disrupted in the absence of an external directional reference. Thus, bees store landmark memories in an egocentric frame of reference and only loose and facultative associations between visual memories and compass cues are formed.","Flight; Honey bee; Landmark; Memory; Visual learning",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036008959

The main goal of our work was to evaluate the use of honey proteins as chemical markers of the floral origin of honey. Considering that honeybee proteins should be common to all types of honey, we decided to verify the usefulness of pollen proteins as floral origin markers in honey. We used polyclonal anti-pollen antibodies raised in rabbits by repeated immunization of Sunflower (Elianthus annuus) and Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus sp.) pollen extracts. The IgG fraction was purified by immunoaffinity. These antibodies were verified with nitrocellulose blotted pollen and unifloral honey protein extracts. The antibodies anti-Sunflower pollen, bound to the 36 and 33 kDa proteins of Sunflower unifloral honey and to honey containing Sunflower pollen; and the antibodies anti-Eucalyptus sp. pollen bound to the 38 kDa proteins of Eucalyptus sp. unifloral honey in immunoblot assays. Satisfactory results were obtained in differentiating between the types of pollen analyzed and between Sunflower honey and Eucalyptus honey with less cross reactivity with other types of honey from different origin and also with good sensitivity in the detection. This immunoblot method opens an interesting field for the development of new antibodies from different plants, which could serve as an alternative or complementary method to the usual melissopalynological analysis to assess honey floral origin.","Botanical origin; Electrophoresis; Floral origin; Honey; Melissopalynology; Protein; Western blot",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037070319

The method considers the choice of appropriate output parameters. Sensitivity analysis was used to rank the input variables in terms of relative importance. In this model, seasonal variation in brood rearing of the host honeybees was found to be more important in determining the mite population growth rate than the reproductive rate of the mites. Simulations with different amounts of drone brood highlight its importance in determining the growth rate of the varroa population. Possible biological control methods that beekeepers can apply are discussed. Simulations with shortened post-capping times (PCTs) of worker brood and drone brood indicate that a reduction of about 10% in the PCTs for drone or worker brood would reduce the mite population growth by about 30 or 60%, respectively. This analysis highlighted some important variables that appear to have been given little consideration by previous workers, such as the start and end time of the brood rearing season.

In contrast, practically all ovarioles in the ovary of queens survive to the adult stage. The correct formation and persistence of polyfusomes has been suggested as a critical factor for ovariole survival. We have analyzed the developmental dynamics of F-actin and α-spectrin in fusomes of queen and worker larvae, and in juvenile-hormone-treated worker larvae. Small fusomes containing actin and spectrin can be detected in the ovaries of fourth instar larvae in both castes. After molting to the fifth instar, the actin-spectrin association persists in the enlarged fusomes of queen ovarioles. In workers, actin dissociates from the fusomal and cortical α-spectrin. Coinciding with the appearance of apoptosis markers, large agglomerates of actin are detectable in worker ovarioles. Treatment of fourth-instar worker larvae with juvenile hormone rescues ovarioles from apoptosis and maintains the actin-spectrin association. Juvenile-hormone-dependent actin-spectrin interaction is thus one of the earliest steps in the differentiation of a polymorphic ovary. Plasticity in ovariole numbers as a result of hormone-dependent fusome formation may be a more widespread phenomenon in insects, extending beyond caste polymorphism in highly eusocial Hymenoptera.","Bee, Apis mellifera (Insecta); Cytoskeleton; Fusome; Insect ovary; Programmed cell death",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036175193

The lack of genomic tools in this species has, however, hampered efforts to provide genome-based explanations for behavioral data. We have combined the power of DNA arrays and the availability of distinct behavioral stages in honeybees to explore the dynamics of gene expression during adult development in this insect. In addition, we used caffeine treatment, a procedure that accelerates learning abilities in honeybees, to examine changes in gene expression underlying drug-induced behavioral modifications. RESULTS: Spotted microarrays containing several thousand cDNAs were interrogated with RNAs extracted from newly emerged worker bees, experienced foragers and caffeine-treated bees. Thirty-six differentially expressed cDNAs were verified by northern blot hybridization and characterized in silico by sequencing and database searches. Experienced foragers overexpressed royal jelly proteins, a putative imaginal disc growth factor, a transcriptional regulator (Stck) and several enzymes, including alpha-glucosidases, aminopeptidases and glucose dehydrogenase. Naive workers showed increased expression of members of the SPARC and lectin families, heat-shock cognate proteins and several proteins related to RNA translation and mitochondrial function. A number of novel genes overexpressed in both naive and experienced bees, and genes induced by caffeine, have also been identified.

The highest number of sleeping bees were found at 28 °C. Evaluation of sleep behaviour in an observation hive revealed that bees prefer the same ambient temperature of about 28 °C under natural conditions. Honeybees save energy during sleep with an ectothermic behaviour, but do not reduce their metabolic rates as much as possible by choosing places in the beehive with the lowest temperature. Instead, they prefer places with moderate intermediate temperatures, probably in order to promote regenerative processes during sleep. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Investigation of the action of propolis on the heat production rate of Varroa mites was performed by means of a Biocalorimeter (BCP 600). Calorimetric results point to the fact that even weak propolis concentrations with feeble lethal effects have a strong influence on the specific heat production rate.

In this comparative study on ecdysteroid titers in the highly social honey bee, Apis mellifera, and a stingless bee, Melipona quadrifasciata, we focussed on the relationship between the ecdysteroid titer, social conditions (presence or absence of the queen), and ovary activity. In contrast to bumblebees, ecdysteroid titers in honey bee and stingless bee workers were either not altered, or dropped to even lower levels after the queen was removed. We also did not detect differences between virgin queens and mated, egg laying queens. These results suggest that ecdysteroids may have lost most of their reproductive functions - yet gained functions in larval caste differentiation - as higher levels of social organization were attained in the evolution of social insects. The observation that ecdysteroid titers are transiently elevated in young workers adds a new, yet functionally still speculative facet to hormonal regulation in insect societies. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We carried out experiments to determine when levels of vitellogenin are first detected in hemolymph of female castes of Apis mellifera, and whether juvenile hormone and ecdysteroids modulate this process. Vitellogenin levels were measured in hemolymph using immunological techniques. We show that in both castes the appearance of vitellogenin in the hemolymph occurs during the pupal period, but the timing was different in the queen and worker. Vitellogenin appears in queens during an early phase of cuticle pigmentation approximately 60h before eclosion, while in workers the appearance of vitellogenin is more delayed, initiating in the pharate adult stage, approximately 10h before eclosion. The timing of vitellogenin appearance in both castes coincides with a slight increase in endogenous levels of juvenile hormone that occurs at the end of pupal development. The correlation between these events was corroborated by topical application of juvenile hormone. Exogenous juvenile hormone advanced the timing of vitellogenin appearance in both castes, but caste-specific differences in timing were maintained. Injection of actinomycin D prevented the response to juvenile hormone. In contrast, queen and worker pupae that were treated with ecdysone showed a delay in the appearance of vitellogenin. These data suggest that queens and workers share a common control mechanism for the timing of vitellogenin synthesis, involving an increase in juvenile hormone titers in the presence of low levels of ecdysteroids.","Ecdysone; Honey bee; Juvenile hormone; Vitellogenin",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002817199

Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), an active component of honeybee propolis, has been identified to show anti-inflammatory, anti-viral and anti-cancer activities. The present study, therefore, examined effects of CAPE on iNOS expression and activity of iNOS enzyme itself. Treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with CAPE significantly inhibited NO production and iNOS protein expression induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). CAPE also inhibited iNOS mRNA expression and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) binding activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, transfection of RAW 264.7 cells with iNOS promoter linked to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, revealed that CAPE inhibited the iNOS promoter activity induced by LPS plus IFN-γ through the NF-κB sites of the iNOS promoter. In addition, CAPE directly interfered with the catalytic activity of murine recombinant iNOS enzyme. These results suggest that CAPE may exert its anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the iNOS gene expression at the transcriptional level through the suppression of NF-κB activation, and by directly inhibiting the catalytic activity of iNOS. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

The efficiency of recruitment with and without transmission of direction information in the waggle dance was quantified using artificial, plentiful unscented food sources and hives which were turned to a horizontal position to disrupt orientation of dancing bees and thereby eliminate the spatial information from dances. Transmission of location information seems to improve recruitment effect particularly at large distances. Recruitment declines more rapidly with distance if dances are disoriented, and for large distances it takes a few hours before a foraging group is established. However, this shows that even without dance information, foragers manage to recruit some bees to their food source. This process, however, is so slow that by the time a group of recruits has reached the food source, it may not be worth exploiting any more.

This pheromone mimicry by invading A. m. capensis workers causes a breakdown in reproductive regulation, resulting in reproductive anarchy.","Apis mellifera; Caste plasticity; Pheromones; Social parasite; Worker reproduction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036245937

Periodical evaluations of those colonies unravelled the pattern of the previously mentioned variables across the season, and allowed for comparative numerical analyses. Progressive reductions on the amount of capped worker brood, bee population and honey storage in mite-infested colonies only became increasingly evident during spring and summer, apparently associated with impressive mite population increases. By the end of the experiment, mite-infested colonies showed a unitary average reduction of 45% in the amount of capped honey they stored, meaning an average annual loss of ≈ 24 kg of honey per colony.

This results in worker-queen intermediates, with reduced pollen combs, enlarged spermathecae and higher numbers of ovarioles. The intermediates weigh more and develop faster than normal workers. The appearance of worker-queen intermediates probably affects parasitism of the African honey bee colonies by Cape workers. Different levels of larval nutrition resulting in less distinct caste differentiation may be important for the reproductive success of Cape workers in their own colonies.

The A. m. capensis workers, which are parasitizing and killing A. m. scutellata colonies in northern South Africa, are the asexual offspring of a single, original worker in which the small amount of genetic variation observed is due to crossing over during meiosis (P.

Parasitic A. m. capensis workers activate their ovaries in host colonies that have a queen present (queenright colonies), and they lay eggs that evade being killed by other workers (worker policing) - the normal fate of worker-laid eggs in colonies with a queen.

Bees removed the dead bees from the Modified-Gary-Trap, especially during good flight conditions. Dead bees disappeared from the IPSAB-Trap because of predators and wind. Both Gary-Traps had a negative effect on undertaking behaviour; the number of behavioural components involved in removing a dead bee from the colony was large and thus, undertaking took a long time. In IPSAB-Trap, the undertaker bees showed the same number of behavioural components and took similar times to remove dead bees as the control colonies without traps.

European (EHB) and Africanized (AHB) honey bees are two Apis mellifera subspecies that coexist in Mexico, the former highly compatible with Varroa destructor, the latter less compatible. Here we examine two mechanisms that could explain the low compatibility between AHB and V. destructor in Mexico: (1) grooming behavior appeared significantly more intensive in AHB colonies, but was nevertheless ineffective; (2) EHB removed 8.03% of the infested brood, while AHB removed 32.46%, especially between 5 and 7 days post-capping. Though the cost of removing infested brood was not different between subspecies, the result, in terms of the amount of removed infested brood, was significantly higher for AHB. For both bees, there is thus a real cost, since removing a pupa results in a lower number of adult bees. We discuss the possibility that the removal of infested brood corresponds with a threshold above which the cost of removal becomes greater than the benefit.","Apis mellifera; Behavioral resistance; Costs and benefits; Parasitology; Varroa destructor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036753384

We obtained reference populations from Europe, Africa, and South America and used these to provide baseline information for a microsatellite and mitochondrial analysis of the process of Africanization of the bees of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. The genetic structure of the Yucatecan population has changed dramatically over time. The pre-Africanized Yucatecan population (1985) comprised bees that were most similar to samples from southeastern Europe and northern and western Europe. Three years after the arrival of Africanized bees (1989), substantial paternal gene flow had occurred from feral Africanized drones into the resident European population, but maternal gene flow from the invading Africanized population into the local population was negligible. However by 1998, there was a radical shift with both African nuclear alleles (65%) and African-derived mitochondria (61%) dominating the genomes of domestic colonies.

Discriminant analysis showed that A4, O26, B4, D7, L13, N23 and E9 angles sufficiently discriminated the samples from different subspecies of Turkish honey bees. The first three-subset out of five canonical discriminant functions explained 96.1% of total variations. All samples collected from central and north-east Anatolia regions were 100% correctly classified into their original regions. The samples of other regions were overlapped with each other. The overall percentage of cases classified correctly was 88.9% (32 out of 36 cases). In conclusion, there are high biometrical variations between different regions of Turkey in terms of forewing angles of honey bees and forewing angles can be used for discrimination of Turkish honey bees.","Apis mellifera; Forewing angles; Genotype; Honey bees; Morphology; Morphometrics; Subspecies; Turkey",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036039659

Here, we show that honeybees (Apis mellifera) and gray jays (Perisoreus canadensis) are also influenced by the addition of an option to a choice set (i.e., by a change in local context). Like humans, our subjects violated basic properties of rational choice. Their relative preference between two original options changed with the introduction of a third, relatively unattractive option. Such context-dependent choice violates the constant-ratio rule. Our subjects increased their relative preference for the more similar of two alternatives, contrary to the similarity hypothesis. The jays also increased their absolute preference for the more similar of two alternatives, in violation of regularity. Thus, the principle of irrelevant alternatives, which assumes that preference between options does not depend on the presence or absence of other options, is violated not only by humans, but also by an invertebrate and a nonhuman vertebrate. These findings contradict the view that nonhuman animals should be immune to such psychological effects and that they should conform with normative accounts, such as rationality or optimal-foraging theory, because their decision-making processes are evolutionarily adaptive. We discuss the potential generality of context-dependent effects and suggest that such effects should be incorporated into decision-making models in behavioral ecology.","Asymmetric dominance; Context-dependent preferences; Foraging; Gray jays; Honeybees; Rationality; Regularity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036460882

Forty isolates of entomopathogenic fungi were assessed against V. destructor in a single-dose experiment (conidial concentration 1 × 108 ml-1) at 25°C and 100% RH. The fungal species were Verticillium lecanii (nine isolates), Hirsutella spp. (16 isolates), Paecilomyces spp. (three isolates), Beauveria bassiana (four isolates), Metarhizium spp. (six isolates), and Tolypocladium spp. (two isolates). All isolates could infect and kill V. destructor and 26 caused mean times to death of less than 100 h. Control (Tween-treated) mortality was 5% at 7 days post-treatment. Nineteen isolates were also examined for side effects against bees. Caged bees sprayed with conidial suspensions (1 × 108 ml-1) of seven of these isolates died within 14 days. However, not all mortality could be attributed to fungal infection as confirmed by sporulation; the mortality of control bees was 27%. Nine isolates were selected for further examination against V. destructor at 30°C and 40% RH to simulate the conditions in bee colonies. Of these, three isolates of M. anisopliae, one of V. lecanii, and one of B. bassiana killed 100% of V. destructor within 7 days at a conidial concentration of 1 × 108 ml-1. One isolate of M. anisopliae also killed 97% of V. destructor within 7 days at a conidial concentration of 1 × 106 ml-1.

The pathogenic mechanisms occurring in these accidents are still unclear. In this work the LD50 bee venom activity on kidney, skeletal muscle and renal vasculature of mice inoculated at 5, 10, 24 and 48 hours was studied. Necropsy specimens were obtained from kidney and sartorial muscles for light microscopy and electron microscopy studies. After 24 hours of exposure there was no evidence of structural changes on the kidney under light microscopy. Nevertheless, muscular tissue revealed lesions characterised by necrosis, phagocytosis and associated focal leukocyte inflammatory infiltration. In addition, mild regenerative activity and increase of the intermyofibrilar spaces in other muscular fibres were observed. From 5 to 48 hours there were ultrastructural changes on the kidney tissue. Showing early cellular swelling, non-uniform enlarging of the parietal or visceral glomerular membrane, tubular cell vacuolisation, capillary wall enlargment, haemoglobin presence in the lumen of the convoluted proximal tubules with later damage of sarcolemmal membrane. Changes in the muscular fibres were characterised by the presence of irregular and hyperchromatic nuclei and the sarcoplasma, augmented endothelial cytoplasm with prolongation toward the capillary lumen, muscular atrophy and partial loss of the sarcomeric striation. Besides to the increase of the intermyofibrillar spaces, prominent triads and pleomorphic mitochondria were evidenced. The subsarcolemmic nuclei were rounded and the nucleoli with diminished electronic density. The subsarcolemmic space was uncover, with abundant polysomes and mitochondria. An increase of the intermyofibrillar spaces, suggesting atrophy, was observed. The mitochondria were pleomorphic and electron dense. In some areas there was neither line M nor band H. Necrosis in muscle fibres was also observed, with the loss of the plasmatic membrane and cellular residues. The capillary endothelium of kidney vessels was altered with increment of the fenestrae. The capillary wall was augmented, with prolongation toward the lumen of the cytoplasm. These changes may be due to interactive effects of the multifactorial action of bee venom components (Phospholipase A2, mellitin, apamin and histamine).","Apis mellifera; Bee; Structure; Ultrastructural damage; Venom",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2542424665

One of these haplotypes shows the same restriction pattern and composition of the intergenic region carried by honeybees belonging to the African lineage. Two haplotypes are characterised by a particular intergenic region found with high frequency in the Canarian populations. The haplotype representative of the East European honeybee lineage shows a frequency of 35%, thus indicating introduction of queen honeybees.

We examined behaviours related to the choice and collection of pollen by foragers among six floral species and three artificial substrates (pollen analogues). First, we evaluated the responses of honeybees to the odours produced by different pollens (or pollen analogues) and pollen lipid extracts. Honeybees displayed similar levels of preference to the odours produced by all pollen species over those of pollen analogues, with a similar pattern of response shown to their extracts. We then evaluated behaviours of foragers in response to variation in particle size, using soybean meal that was ground and sifted to create a hierarchy of particle size classes. Bees preferred particle sizes below 150 μm, but the greatest response was shown for those particle sizes below 45 μm. We also assayed the effect of varying protein content on the foraging decisions made by bees by mixing soy flour with different proportions of cellulose powder. Foragers, however, were incapable of discriminating protein content. We determined changes in the response of foragers to different levels of handling time using different sized screens through which bees were forced to crawl to reach an attractive pollen odour source. In these tests, pollen-seeking behaviours were seen to decrease with increases in handling time. When odour was presented simultaneously with other stimuli, it was the primary and overriding cue used by bees to select pollen. These results suggest that individual honeybee foragers do not discriminate among pollen sources based on intrinsic differences in quality, but instead evaluate cues that may increase their efficiency of collection and recruitment to such a food resource. © 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036057267

Workers that produce vibration signals contact numerous other bees, some of which receive the signal while others are 'bypassed' (antennated but not vibrated). Vibrating bees may therefore select among potential recipients. We monitored vibration signal behaviour in six observation colonies to investigate the possible selection of recipients by vibrating bees and the factors that might influence these choices. Vibrating bees roamed throughout the nest and bypassed more than half of all workers contacted. Vibration signals were not directed towards specific worker age groups. There were no differences in the mean age of vibrated versus bypassed workers or the proportion of recipients that were of preforaging versus foraging age. The likelihood of receiving vibration signals was influenced by recipient activity level. Significantly more workers were vibrated if they were inactive versus active when contacted by a signalling bee. Signal production was not consistently influenced by relatedness. Vibrating bees from only a single patriline in one of our study colonies were more likely to perform signals on supersisters than on half-sisters. In all other colonies no kin preferences were observed during signal performance. Thus, vibrating bees may choose among potential recipients and direct their signals towards inactive workers of all ages and levels of relatedness. This, in combination with their movement throughout the colony, could help to activate simultaneously multiple worker groups that perform interdependent tasks, but which may be spatially segregated in the nest. © 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036055227

As workers and haploid drones develop in differently sized brood cells, they can be discriminated without sex inspection. However, because diploid drone larvae originate from fertilised eggs like workers, they hatch in brood cells of the same type and cannot be sampled according to cell size. In search of a reliable method of sexing live first instar larvae, we found that the contour and size proportions of the epiproct can be used for discrimination. The sex diagnosis based on these characters is carried out rapidly under a stereo microscope and allows the collection of pure samples of newly hatched diploid drone larvae from brood combs of inbred colonies.","Apis mellifera; Diploid drones; Epiproct; Sexing of live larvae",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036272089

By capturing hive bees that landed at the feeder in a 2-h period, the arrival rate of incoming bees could be obtained. With this procedure we quantitatively analyzed the maximum number of hive bees that can be brought to the feeding station by single foragers. Test bees collected sucrose solution during 12 visits to a rate-feeder located 160 m from the hive. The constant programs offered 0.6, 1.2, or 2.4 M sugar for all 12 visits, while the variable programs delivered either 0.6, 1.2, or 0.6 M or 0.6, 2.4, or 0.6 M, with four visits for each molarity. Results showed that the sucrose concentration exploited by single foragers increased the arrival rate. Moreover, there was a linear relationship within this range of sucrose concentrations that presented a slope of 1.58. Since the sugar solutions were provided at the same flow rate (5 μl/min) in all the programs, the arrival rate expressed in terms of sucrose flow rate (milligrams of sucrose/minute) shows that one additional incoming bee per hour arrived when the single forager assessed an increase in the sucrose flow rate of 0.75 mg sucrose/min at the rate-feeder. The absence of differences in the frequency of visits of the single foragers during the constant programs suggests that the differences observed in the arrival rate can mainly be explained by a more intensive display of the recruitment mechanisms performed per foraging trip instead of by their iterativeness throughout different foraging cycles. Variable reward programs showed that arrival rate is rapidly adjusted according to the reward change and is independent of its magnitude.","Apis mellifera; Foraging; Honeybee; Recruitment",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036184805

Paradoxically, little information is available on the distribution and economic impact of AHB on the beekeeping industry of the country. In this study we report the results of a survey of 186 managed colonies sampled during July 2000 in 16 departments of Peru covering all climatic environments within two transects. Morphometric classification showed that AHB colonies were found in all the Peruvian departments under study. However, the occupation of the Peruvian territory by AHB has produced varied levels of Africanization. Only 53% of the colonies were of ‘pure’ Africanized morphotype, whilst 30% were of intermediate African-European categories and 17% were of ‘pure’ European morphotype. There were also significant differences in the percentage of AHB colonies between departments and transects: the tropical departments and transects of the east were practically saturated with AHB colonies, but the tropical areas of the western Pacific coast showed more predominance of European honey bee (EHB) colonies. These results suggest that hybridization between EHB and AHB in western Peru has occurred as a result of reduced numerical advantages of the latter, in this case, due to a geographic barrier limiting the continued influx of AHB swarms. Currently, the beekeeping industry in Peru is increasing which probably reflects the adaptation of a new generation of beekeepers to AHB. We suggest that the establishment of national plans for selection and transfer of technology are feasible given the great potential for beekeeping in Peru. © 2002 International Bee Research Association.","Africanized honey bees; Apis mellifera; Beekeeping; Morphometrics; Peru",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036928455

Several regimes of sampling or removing drone bee pupae to estimate or remove numbers of varroa mites were simulated to compare their effectiveness. The model indicated that regular sampling of at least 100 drone pupae could provide the beekeeper with a useful warning of when numbers of varroa were approaching damaging levels. An infestation level of 15% of drone pupae would be a conservative threshold to indicate treatment was imminently required. The model indicated that significant reduction of mite numbers could be achieved either by very regular uncapping and removal of most of the natural drone pupae, or by trapping mites in artificially high numbers of drone pupae. The numbers of drone pupae required to significantly delay the mite build-up could be reduced considerably by trapping at a time when the bee colony was otherwise broodless.

Bees were trained to each of five different shapes, a disc, a square, a diamond and two different triangles, all of the same area, using fresh bees in each experiment. In subsequent tests, the trained bees were given a choice between the learned shape and each of the other four shapes. Two sets of experiments were conducted with both species. In the first, solid black shapes were presented against a white background, thus providing a high luminance contrast. In the second, the shapes carried a random black-and-white pattern and were presented 5cm in front of a similar pattern, thus producing motion contrast, rather than luminance contrast, against the background. The results obtained with the solid shapes reveal that both bee species accomplish the discrimination, although the performance of the honeybee is significantly better than that of the leaf-cutter bee. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the various shapes differs between the two species. However, in neither species is the discrimination performance correlated with the amount of overlap of the black areas contained in the various pairs of shapes, suggesting that, in our experiments, shape discrimination is not based on a template-matching process. We propose that it is based on the use of local parameters situated at the outline of the shape, such as the position of angles or acute points and, in particular, the position and orientation of edges. This conclusion is supported by the finding that bees of both species accomplish the discrimination even with the patterned shapes. These shapes are visible only because of the discontinuity of the speed of image motion perceived at the edge between the shape and the background.","Apis mellifera; Convex shape; Honeybee; Leaf-cutter bee; Luminance contrast; Megachile rotundata; Motion contrast; Shape discrimination; Training; Vision",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036022375

Recently it has been proposed that iron-rich granules found inside the fat body cells of this honeybee had small magnetite crystals that were responsible for this behaviour. In the present work, we studied the iron containing granules from queens of two species of honeybees (A. mellifera and Scaptotrigona postica) by electron microscopy methods in order to clarify this point. The granules were found inside rough endoplasmic reticulum cisternae. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis of granules from A. mellifera showed the presence of iron, phosphorus and calcium. The same analysis performed on the granules of S. postica also indicated the presence of these elements along with the additional element magnesium. The granules of A. mellifera were composed of apoferritin-like particles in the periphery while in the core, clusters of organised particles resembling holoferritin were seen. The larger and more mineralised granules of S. postica presented structures resembling ferritin cores in the periphery, and smaller electron dense particles inside the bulk. Electron spectroscopic images of the granules from A. mellifera showed that iron, oxygen and phosphorus were co-localised in the ferritin-like deposits. These results indicate that the iron-rich granules of these honeybees are formed by accumulation of ferritin and its degraded forms together with elements present inside the rough endoplasmic reticulum, such as phosphorus, calcium and magnesium. It is suggested that the high level of phosphate in the milieu would prevent the crystallisation of iron oxides in these structures, making very unlikely their participation in magnetoreception mechanisms. They are most probably involved in iron homeostasis. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We carried out experiments to determine when levels of vitellogenin are first detected in hemolymph of female castes of Apis mellifera, and whether juvenile hormone and ecdysteroids modulate this process. Vitellogenin levels were measured in hemolymph using immunological techniques. We show that in both castes the appearance of vitellogenin in the hemolymph occurs during the pupal period, but the timing was different in the queen and worker. Vitellogenin appears in queens during an early phase of cuticle pigmentation approximately 60h before eclosion, while in workers the appearance of vitellogenin is more delayed, initiating in the pharate adult stage, approximately 10h before eclosion. The timing of vitellogenin appearance in both castes coincides with a slight increase in endogenous levels of juvenile hormone that occurs at the end of pupal development. The correlation between these events was corroborated by topical application of juvenile hormone. Exogenous juvenile hormone advanced the timing of vitellogenin appearance in both castes, but caste-specific differences in timing were maintained. Injection of actinomycin D prevented the response to juvenile hormone. In contrast, queen and worker pupae that were treated with ecdysone showed a delay in the appearance of vitellogenin. These data suggest that queens and workers share a common control mechanism for the timing of vitellogenin synthesis, involving an increase in juvenile hormone titers in the presence of low levels of ecdysteroids.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044705328

Predominantly, either one or both median MB subunits were ablated. This prompted us to analyze the effects of asymmetrical or symmetrical HU-induced MB ablation on both the morphology of the brain and on the level of three proteins (synapsin, PKA RII, and PKC), which are considered to play a role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. In brains with one median MB subunit missing the volume of the overall MB calyx neuropil in the lesioned side was diminished by 35%. This strong reduction occurred although the remaining lateral MB calyx of the lesioned brain side was found to be significantly larger than that of the intact side. Accordingly, in brains with both median MB subunits missing the size of the remaining lateral calyces increased. The various types of MB ablation differentially affected the amounts of synapsin, PKA RII, and PKC expressed in the central brain. In animals with bilateral and thus symmetrical MB ablation (both median calyces ablated) the protein amount was found to be similar to that in control animals. However, unilateral MB ablation causes an increase in the amounts of the tested proteins in the intact brain side, while the levels in the ablated side were the same as in control animals. These findings not only show that HU-induced ablation of MB subunits is accompanied by volume changes and by changes in protein expression, but also suggest that these processes are highly regulated between the brain sides. The latter is of general importance in understanding the potential contribution of the MB subunits to learning and memory and their interaction between the brain sides. © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Chemical ablation; Insect brain; Kenyon cells; Mushroom bodies; PKA; PKC; Synapsin",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036135769

The population dynamics of host and parasites are computed for 100 generations after an initial infestation with parasitic workers.

They are secreted by hypopharyngeal glands and provide major proteinaceous components of the larval food. To date nothing is known about royal jelly proteins in other bee species. To fill this gap, we screened the genome of the Asian giant honey bee, Apis dorsata, for the two MRJP protein coding sequences MRJP3 and MRJP5. With PCR primers originally designed for A. mellifera we were able to amplify the presumably orthologous sequences in A. dorsata. Sequence analyses revealed high similarity in the two honey bees. As described in A. mellifera we found an orthologous extensive repetitive region in the MRJP3 sequence of A. dorsata. The number of reiterated repetitive motifs is highly variable in different A. dorsata individuals and is therefore well suited as a marker in population studies. The MRJP5 sequence region contains another repetitive region at the orthologous position as described for A. mellifera. These findings confirm the presence and indicate the functional equivalence of MRJP proteins in A. dorsata compared to A. mellifera.

Ideally this action involves communication between the workers, enabling coordinated action and a fast response. The Asian dwarf honeybee, Apis florea, is a small honeybee with an open nesting habit and a comparatively small colony size, features that leave them particularly exposed to predators. We describe here a novel defence response of these bees in which the emission of an initial warning signal from one individual (""piping"") is followed 0.3 to 0.7 seconds later by a general response from a large number of bees (""hissing""). Piping is audible to the human ear, with a fundamental frequency of 384 ± 31Hz and lasting for 0.82 ± 0.35 seconds. Hissing is a broad band, noisy signal, clearly audible to the human observer and produced by slight but visible movements of the bees' wings. Hissing begins in individuals close to the piping bee, spreads rapidly to neighbours and results in an impressive coordinated crescendo occasionally involving the entire colony. Piping and hissing are accompanied by a marked decrease, or even cessation, of worker activities such as forager dancing and departures from the colony. We show that whereas hissing of the colony can be elicited without piping, the sequential and correlated piping and hissing response is specific to the presence of potential predators close to the colony. We suggest that the combined audio-visual effect of the hissing might deter small predators, while the cessation of flight activity could decrease the risk of predation by birds and insects which prey selectively on flying bees.","Alarm communication; Apis florea; Colony defence; Hissing; Worker piping",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037001342

Low mite reproductive success in cells containing pseudo-clone was mainly as a result of increased mite mortality. This was caused by male protonymphs and some mothers becoming trapped in the upper part of the cell due to the pseudo-clone being 8% larger than their host and not due to their short developmental time.

A. andreniformis and A. florea chose similar nest sites, but the spatial correlations of their nesting sites were significantly negative, indicating that colonies may avoid areas containing nests of the other species. A. andreniformis nested at heights averaging about 6 m while A. florea nested at heights averaging about 4 m. The tendency of colonies of these species to establish their nest sites near existing nest sites of colonies of the same species may increase the probability that the newly selected nest sites are near suitable floral resources capable of supporting the survival and reproduction of the newer arrivals to the area. More importantly, spatial clumping probably helps assure that a colony's future reproductives will have potential mates within their mating range. Avoiding close association with colonies of conspecifics may help diminish interspecific interference with mating that may arise from the species having similar sex pheromones.","Apis andreniformis; Apis florea; Asian honeybees; Spatial distribution; Thailand",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036861271

In queenright (QR) workers it is composed of odd n alkanes, while in queens it also possesses long chain esters. However, glandular expression is plastic since queenless (QL) workers produce a queen-like secretion. Moreover, QR gland incubated in vitro produced these esters, indicating that glandular activity is regulated. We tested the hypothesis that the secretion is an egg marking pheromone. Chemical analysis of the egg coating revealed minute amounts of the queen esters, but neither queen secretion nor the synthetic esters were able to protect worker-laid eggs from policing, refuting the hypothesis. Analysis of abdominal tips further revealed that Dufour's egg secretion is also smeared on the abodominal cuticle, suggesting that its presence on egg surface may be due to passive contamination. Next, we tested the hypothesis that the secretion serves as a queen signal. Indeed queens, but not worker glandular secretion were attractive to workers.","Caste-specificity; Dufour's gland; Honeybee, queen-signal; Retinue behavior",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036860730

Tendency to run was positively correlated with tendency to hang from combs, and with hygienic behavior, but was negatively correlated with forewing length. Forewing length was negatively correlated with hygienic behavior, but it was not significantly correlated with stinging behavior.

In the present work, characteristics of nectar reward and floral morphology revealed that 'Jonathan' and 'Topred' flowers had similar nectar constitutions. However, honeybee behaviour was totally different in the two cultivars. 'Jonathan' flowers attracted fewer honeybees but, due to their anther arrangement, more of the flowers were approached from the top by honeybees collecting nectar than in 'Topred'.

Visual compound stimuli are relevant in nautre as bees learn flower images that consist of many visual elements. We studied whether elemental associations between each visual element and the reinforcement (elemental approach) are enough to explain the solving of visual discrimination problems that raise ambiguity at the elemental level. We asked whether bees could solve three different visual discriminations: (1) positive patterning (A-, B-, AB+); (2) negative patterning (A+, B+, AB-); and (3) biconditional discrimination (AB+, CD+, AC-, BD-). In experiments 1 and 2 bees had to discriminate a yellow-violet chequerboard from the yellow or the violet squares alone. In experiment 3, four different gratings combining one colour (yellow or violet) with one orientation (vertical or horizontal) had to be discriminated. In all three problems binary compounds were trained in such a way that each element appeared equally often as rewarded and nonrewarded. Bees could solve the three discrimination problems. They always chose the reinforced stimulus despite ambiguity at the level of the elements. For solving positive patterning, elemental processing could be used. For negative patterning and biconditional discrimination, nonelemental processing strategies (unique-cue or configural approach) are necessary to account for these results. Although we cannot decide between a configural and a unique-cue interpretation, we can clearly reject purely elemental processing in these cases. © 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

The geometric approaches use Procrustes distances in a curved shape space and distances in tangent spaces within and among families to estimate shape heritability. We illustrate the protocols with an example of wing shape variation in the honeybee, Apis mellifera. The heritability of overall shape variation was small, but some localized components depicting shape changes on distal wing regions showed medium to large heritabilities. The genetic variance-covariance matrix of the geometric shape variables was significantly correlated with the phenotypic shape variance-covariance matrix. A comparison of the results of geometric methods with the traditional multivariate analysis of interlandmark distances indicated that even with a larger dimensionality, the interlandmark distances were not as rich in shape information as the landmark coordinates.

At five commercial fields in 1998 and 1999, biennial caraway flowered for 7 wk, beginning in late May or early June and finishing by early to mid-July. Under optimal conditions, and assuming intense foraging activity by honey bees (Apis mellifera L.), caraway might yield 70-134 kg honey ha-1. However, weights of colonies near fields of caraway (0.47-4.2 hives ha-1) changed little while honey bees were predominant foragers on that crop. Then, in the second half of the caraway flowering period, when honey bees had almost deserted those fields as indicated by observation and pollen-trap analyses, hive weights rose steadily due to a switch to nearby crops of canola (Brassica spp.) and sweet clover (Melilotus spp.), which had begun to flower. Whereas biennial caraway is rated as negligible to only moderate for its honey potential in Saskatchewan, 83% of honey bees visiting caraway florets gathered pollen. Moreover, caraway pollen entering hives averaged 11% of total pollen (dry weight) over the entire flowering period of the crop, but 36.5% during the first half of flowering phenology, suggesting that biennial caraway may constitute a valuable source of protein for honey bees, particularly during colony build-up in spring.","Caraway (Carum carvi); Flowering phenology; Hive weights; Honey bee foraging; Honey potential; Pollen-trap collection",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036216699

The last inseminating males were identified by collecting and genotyping the mating sign left in the genital tract of each queen. Significant differences in paternity frequencies were observed between males, but the proportion of worker and queen offspring sired by the last inseminating drone did not differ significantly from those of other drones. Each male kept his rank of precedence for the different cohorts, although the variance in subfamily proportions decreased over time, most notably in the colony displaying the lowest level of polyandry. These results suggest that, if sperm competition exists in the honeybee, it does not significantly increase the fitness of the last inseminating drone. The spermatozoa of the different inseminating drones are not totally mixed before they reach the spermatheca, in particular when only few males mate with the queen.

Inhibition of the ATPase activity of these preparations by DDT was parallel to the poisoning of the source organism with DDT. Furthermore, both the inhibition and poisoning of insects were affected similarly by temperature. Inhibition of the insect enzyme activity by DDT was specific and differed from that by oligomycin or N, N-dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide (DCCD). PAGE analysis of the various preparations of the enzyme showed that the inhibition of the enzyme activity by DDT was associated with the presence of a selective protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 23 kDa. This protein band exists in the preparations from the DDT-susceptible insects but was absent from the preparations of the enzyme from the DDT-insensitive sources. Removal of this protein band from the enzyme rendered its activity insensitive to inhibition by DDT.

In all genetic improvement programs the selected characters must be measured with precision, and because of this we evaluated a metabolic method for testing honeybee defensive behavior in the laboratory for its usefulness in distinguishing between honeybee ecotypes and selecting honeybees based on their level of defensive responses. Ten honeybee colonies were used, five having been produced by feral queens from a subtropical region supposedly colonized by Africanized honeybees and five by queens from a temperate region apparently colonized by European honeybees. We evaluate honeybee defensive behavior using a metabolic test based on oxygen consumption after stimulation with an alarm pheromone, measuring the time to the first response, time to maximum oxygen consumption, duration of activity, oxygen consumption at first response, maximum oxygen consumption and total oxygen consumption, colonies being ranked according to the values obtained for each variable. Significant (p < 0.05) differences were detected between ecotypes for each variable but for all variables the highest rankings were obtained for colonies of subtropical origin, which had faster and more intense responses. All variables were highly associated (p < 0.05). Total oxygen consumption was the best indicator of metabolic activity for defensive behavior because it combined oxygen consumption and the length of the response. This laboratory method may be useful for evaluating the defensive behavior of honey bees in genetic programs designed to select less defensive bees.","Defensive behavior; Honeybee; Oxygen consumption",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036492274

The protein status appears to be a major determinant of honeybee lifespan, and the lipoprotein vitellogenin seems to play a crucial role. Here, we give a review of the role of the vitellogenin in honeybee workers, and present a data-driven mathematical model describing the dynamics of this representative protein in the individual bee as a function of its task profile under various regimes. The results support the hypothesis that vitellogenin is a true storage protein that is utilized for various metabolic purposes including the synthesis of brood food. Except for workers having been foragers for many days, they also suggest that the previous life histories of workers do not constrain them from becoming winter bees as long as they get ample food and time to build up their protein reserves before wintering. The results also indicate that it may not be necessary to introduce the ovary as a storage organ for vitellogenin in order to generate normal winter bees. The insights gained from these results are then discussed in a broader gerontological and life history context. Remarkably similar features concerning regulation of ageing in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and honeybees are pointed out and discussed. Furthermore, we show that in contrast to the ""mutation accumulation"" and the ""antagonistic pleiotropy"" evolutionary theories of ageing, the ""disposable soma"" theory is capable of explaining the bimodal longevity distribution of honeybees when interpreted in a group selection context. Finally, by showing that depletion of nutrient stores can be actively controlled by pathways connected to regulation of ageing, we strengthen the claim that age-based division of labour, with performance of risky tasks delayed until late in life by workers with depleted nutrient stores, may have evolved as an energy-saving mechanism in insect colonies. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Osmia excavata successfully established in both coastal (Shandong Province) and interior (Hebei Province) habitats, whereas O. jacoti was only able to establish in the coastal habitat. Sex ratios (female:male) ranged from 1:1.05 for O. jacoti to 1:2.46 for O. excavata. Apple, Malus domestica Borkh (Rosaceae), pollination was enhanced following the release of either species in orchards in Shandong. Fruit diameter increased following the release of either Osmia species in ‘Red Delicious’ blocks compared with control blocks where no pollination treatment was applied. The number of seeds per fruit was also increased relative to controls, and the percentage of asymmetrical fruit decreased. Release of O. excavata produced the best results for this cultivar. For ‘Ralls Janet’, the number of seeds per fruit increased following the release of either species and the percentage of asymmetrical apples decreased. Effects on fruit diameter were confounded by poor cultural practices (i.e., lack of adequate fruit thinning) in these ‘Ralls Janet’ blocks. Fruit set increased relative to controls following release of either Osmia species for both apple cultivars. Release of O. excavata also produced higher fruit set relative to blocks that received hand pollination treatment; release of O. jacoti was better than hand pollination only for ‘Red Delicious’. Observations on the behaviour of individuals showed that O. excavata averaged 49.6 foraging trips per day and set an estimated 3108 fruit on ‘Ralls Janet’; O. jacoti made fewer foraging trips (average of 31.2) per day and set 1831 fruit. Both species were more efficient pollinators than Apis mellifera.

Honey bees (Apis spp.) have among the highest levels of multiple mating in social insects, and have received the most empirical effort to quantify the effective paternities within colonies. We reviewed 24 studies that estimated paternity frequencies of individual, naturally-mated honey bee queens using molecular techniques. We summarize the methods used to estimate effective paternity (me) and intracolonial genetic relatedness (G). We then concentrate on the effect of sample size on estimates of me using Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate that me estimates may vary, significantly as a result of sampling error, particularly at low worker sample sizes and high paternity numbers. From these simulations, we arbitrarily define a ""threshold"" worker sample size to effective paternity ratio (n/me) that, at best, reduces the error of estimating me to less than one subfamily. The literature review illustrates that no study with an n/me ratio above this threshold estimates an me above 15 subfamilies. Finally, we briefly discuss other factors that may serve to over-estimate me including numerous sampling biases. We conclude that although 152 colonies in the various species of Apis have been tested, the extremity of their paternity frequencies may be somewhat exaggerated, although not drastically.","Honey bee; Mating number; Multiple mating; Paternity analysis; Polyandry",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036657389

I found that task switching plays the primary role in this process. Although self-grooming decreased, other indicators of inactivity increased or remained unchanged, leaving the role of reserve labor ambiguous. I also explored the relative importance of specialists versus generalists in the production of work. Wax working, a common task among middle-age workers, was used as a model. I found that although there is a distinct group of wax specialists, they contributed only 19.5% of the total number of wax-working observations. Most wax working was found to be performed by generalists. In addition, I tested for a distinct group of reserve specialists. I found that although activity rates differed between individuals, there was no evidence for a stable group of reserve specialists.

In many insect pests, resistance to pyrethroid insecticides is due to reduced target-site (sodium channel) sensitivity to pyrethroids in the nervous system, a phenomenon called knockdown resistance (kdr). A number of studies showed that kdr and kdr-type resistance is a result of point mutations in the para family of sodium channel genes. To investigate the molecular mechanism of resistance to fluvalinate in varroa, we have cloned and sequenced a large cDNA fragment corresponding to segment 3 of domain II (IIS3) to segment 6 of domain IV (IVS6) of a para-homologous sodium channel gene (VmNa) from susceptible and resistant mite populations. The deduced amino acid sequence from this cDNA shares 71%, 60%, and 50% identity with the corresponding region of the para-homologous protein of the Southern cattle tick, Boophilus microplus, Drosophila melanogaster Para, and rat brain type II sodium channel α-subunit, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that four amino acid changes, F758L in IIIS6, L826P in the linker connecting domains III and IV, 1982V in IVS5 and M1055I in IVS6, were correlated with fluvalinate resistance in both Florida and Michigan populations. Interestingly, the kdr or super-kdr (which confers much higher level resistance than kdr) mutation previously identified in insects was not detected in the resistant mites. These results support the emerging notion that distinct sodium channel gene mutations are selected in different insects and arachnids in response to pyrethroid selection.","Apis mellifera; Apistan; Knockdown resistance; Para; Pyrethroid resistance; Taufluvalinate; Varroa destructor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036039651

Colonies with drone comb gained only 25.2 ± 16.0 kg whereas those without drone comb gained 48.8 ± 14.8 kg. Colonies with drone comb also had a higher mean rate of drone flights and a lower incidence of drone comb building. The lower honey yield of colonies with drone comb apparently arises, at least in part, because drone comb fosters drone rearing and the rearing and maintenance of drones is costly. I suggest that providing colonies with drone comb, as part of a program of controlling Varroa destructor without pesticides, may still be desirable since killing drone brood to kill mites may largely eliminate the negative effect of drone comb on honey yields.","Comb foundation; Drone; Drone comb; Honey bee; Honey production",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036187526

However the experimental tools in doing so are limited in species that have not served as models for genetic studies. We have examined the effects of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the honey bee, an insect with considerably basic scientific interest. dsRNA derived from a 300 bp stretch of the E30 homeobox motif was injected into honey bee embryos at the anterior pole in the preblastoderm stage. We found that the dsRNA fragment successfully disrupted the protein expression of the target gene throughout the whole embryo. The disruption caused deficient phenotypes similar to known loss of function mutants of Drosophila engrailed, whereas embryos injected with nonsense dsRNA showed no abnormalities. We show that the large size of the honey bee egg (D: 0.3 mm, L: 1.6 mm) and the long preblastoderm stage (11-12 h) can be exploited to generate embryos with partial disruption of gene function, which may provide an elegant alternative to classical chimeric analyses. This is the first report of targeted disruption of gene function in the honey bee, and the results prove that the chosen target gene is a functional ortholog to engrailed in Drosophila.","Apis mellifera; Development; Engrailed; Gene silencing; Honey bee; RNA of interference",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036898747

Concurrently, the importance of the natural dispersal of bacteria as a complicating factor was assessed. Tests were performed under two sets of conditions, those that allowed for the dispersal of bacteria via honeybee activity and those that minimized it through the use of translucent polyethylene enclosures around single trees. The enclosures also raised daytime temperatures and allowed for controlled wetting, two factors important to the development of blossom blight. Single-antagonist treatments with strain E325, Pseudomonas fluorescens strain A506, and P. agglomerans strain C9-1 were applied to open blossoms on each of 10 enclosed trees and 10 nonenclosed trees. During bloom, suspensions of antagonists (108 CFU/ml) were applied twice with a brush, and a suspension of Erwinia amylovora (107 CFU/ml) was subsequently applied once using the same method. Two days after inoculation with the pathogen, trees were misted to simulate precipitation. Flower-to-flower spread of antagonistic bacteria was less frequent on trees surrounded by plastic enclosures than on nonenclosed trees. The range and statistical separation of means for population size of E. amylovora and disease incidence among treatments were greater for enclosed trees than for nonenclosed trees. Based on these results, the natural spread of antagonists being compared may mask differences in their efficacy as biocontrol agents. Such distortions and resulting misinterpretations could be lessened by separating treatments widely in large orchard blocks and by monitoring microbial populations. Strain E325 from fresh or lyophilized cultures was consistently more effective than standard antagonists in suppressing E. amylovora and reducing disease incidence. To fully assess its potential use for fire blight, larger-scale trials under various conditions will be necessary.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036112614

We examined worker-queen cell interactions in hybrid colonies that contained African and European patrilines. Worker interactions were associated with a queen's emergence success (e.g. the probability that she would develop to emergence). Compared to queen cells that were destroyed, those that emerged were initiated sooner during the rearing process, were started from younger brood, were visited and incubated at higher rates, and received more vibration signals from workers. In contrast, the worker interactions examined did not influence emergence order (e.g. the sequence that queens emerged relative to one another). African- and European-paternity queens experienced similar emergence success, and did not differ in the rates at which workers visited, incubated or vibrated their cells. African-patriline workers were more likely to engage in queen rearing than their European-paternity nestmates. Workers of both patrilines exhibited super-sister preferences when visiting queen larvae, but showed variable or no kin discrimination during incubation and vibration signal activity. Thus, honey bee workers may use a variety of mechanisms to influence queen development. However, they do not exhibit marked racial or kinship preferences when interacting with queen cells, suggesting that the queen rearing process has not contributed strongly to the spread of the African bee in the Western Hemisphere.","Africanized honey bee; Queen rearing; Vibration signal; Worker-queen interactions",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036436879

However, few studies have examined the behaviour of individual pollen foragers while in the nest between trips. Thus, little is known about how a pollen forager actually assesses its colony's needs. To understand this process better, we observed the behaviour of 319 pollen foragers while in their nests between foraging trips. We observed foragers in two types of nest environments: one with a relatively high need for pollen and one with a relatively low need for pollen. Foragers performed as many as 14 activities during two phases demarcated by the unloading of pollen loads. They inspected empty cells and cells with pollen, and performed the waggle dance at higher relative frequencies before unloading (P≤0.0004 each act). They antennated nestmates, autogroomed and received trophallaxis at higher relative frequencies after unloading (P≤0.0004 each act). All acts were performed both before and after unloading, but not always by each bee. Pollen foragers discriminated among cells based on cell contents in two contexts. First, they inspected cells already containing pollen more often than expected by chance. Second, their pattern of inspecting cells with different contents differed from their pattern of unloading pollen loads in those cells. Pollen foragers performed 42.3 ± 4.6% (least square mean ± SE) of preunloading inspection events on empty cells, but unloaded in them only 19.9 ± 4.6% of the time. They performed 42.2 ± 4.6% of preunloading inspection events on cells already containing pollen, but unloaded in them 79.4 ± 4.6% of the time (P<0.0001). Our data show that pollen foragers can determine the contents of cells in the nest and suggest that the regulation of pollen collection involves direct assessment of colony need by pollen foragers. © 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

The sequences were aligned to the corresponding sequences in the honey bee. Phylogenetic analyses based on parsimony, as well as maximum likelihood, indicate that the bumblebees can be separated into several well-supported clades.

All the cuckoo bumblebees form a well-supported clade, the subgenus Psithyrus, within the true bumblebees. All the analyses place Kallobombus as the most basal taxon in contradiction to former analyses. The other deeper nodes of the phylogenetic trees, which are weakly supported, deviate significantly from former published trees - especially the trees based on mtCO-I. Presumably, the reasons are that multiple hits and the strong bias of the bases A and T blur the relationships in the deepest part of the trees. Analyses of the region in mtCO-I show a very strong A+T bias (A+T=75%), which also indicate preferences in the use of codons with A or T in third positions. In closely related entities, there is only a weak transversion bias (A+T). In the studied regions in EF 1-α, no nucleotide bias is observed.

In the laboratory experiments, the maximum longevity period in honey was 42 days at 4°C; at higher conservation temperatures (28 and 35°C) the bacteria survived less than two days. In beewax, the maximum longevity period was 21 days at 4 and 15°C, 16 days at 28°C, and two days at 35°C. In pollen, the persistence of E. amylovora exceeded 30 weeks at both 4 and 15°C, while at 28 and 35°C bacteria died during the first week after contamination. Regardless of the conservation temperature in propolis, bacteria died shortly after contamination. The longevity of E. amylovora on the honeybee body was 48 h at both 15 and 28°C; at 35°C, viable bacteria were detected up to 42 h after contamination. In the honeybee intestine, the bacteria survived for a maximum of 36 h at both 15 and 28°C; at 35°C, viable bacterial cells were re-isolated up to 30 h after contamination. In beehives kept outdoors during spring, E. amylovora survived for 30 h in honey, 36 h in beewax, 60 h in pollen, 36 h and 30 h on the honeybee body and in the honeybee intestine, respectively. During autumn, bacteria survived for 36 h in honey (peripheral honey comb) and 36-48 h (brood area), for 48 h in beewax, 72 h in pollen and 48 h and 36 h on the honeybee body and in the honeybee intestine, respectively.","Apis mellifera; Bacterial persistence; Fire blight; Honey; Honeywax; Pollen; Propolis",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33745075579

In this article, we determine the complete genome sequence and analyze the gene organization of PnPV. The genome of PnPV consists of 9476 nucleotides (nts) excluding the poly(A) tail and contains a single large open reading frame (ORF) of 8958 nts (2986 codons) flanked by 473 and 45 nt noncoding regions on the 53 and 33 ends, respectively. Northern blotting did not detect the presence of any subgenomic RNA. The PnPV genome codes for four structural proteins (CP1-4), and determination of their N-terminal sequences by Edman degradation, showed that all four are located in the 5′ region of the genome. The 3′ part of the PnPV genome contains the consensus sequence motifs for picornavirus RNA helicase, cysteine protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in that order from the 5′ to the 3′ end. In all of these characters, the genome organization of PnPV resembles the mammalian picornaviruses and two other insect picorna-like viruses, infectious flacherie virus (IFV) of the silkworm and Sacbrood virus (SBV) of the honeybee. In a phylogenetic tree based on the eight conserved domains in the RdRp sequence, PnPV formed a separate cluster with IFV and SBV, which suggests that these three insect picorna-like viruses might constitute a novel group of insect-infecting RNA viruses. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).","Complete genome sequence; Insect; Perina nuda; Picornavirus; PnPV",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036060435

Arable farmland can be enhanced as a habitat for these insects by growing annual nectar- and pollen-producing herbaceous plants for them in non-cropped areas such as set-aside and field margins. In 1996 and 1997, observations were made in Hertfordshire, UK, on the flowering phenology and flower-attractiveness to visiting Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera of plots sown to mixtures of six annual flowering plant species: borage (Borago officinalis), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), cornflower (Centaurea cyanus), mallow (Malva sylvestris), marigold (Calendula officinalis) and phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia) in different proportions. The mixtures had good agronomic and biological properties. They established and flowered well from a range of seed rates and sowing-dates. They attracted a diversity of flower-visiting insects, including the honey bee and eight species of bumble bee amongst 16 species of aculeate Hymenoptera, 17 species of Diptera, mostly syrphids, and six species of Lepidoptera. Sequential sowings provided nectar and pollen from early summer to late autumn during the period after arable crops had finished flowering and food for pollinators was scarce.

While transient covalent modifications of proteins underlie short-term memory, the formation of long-term memory requires gene expression and protein synthesis. Different intracellular signalling cascades have been implicated in distinct aspects of learning and memory formation. Little is known however, about how learning in intact animals is related to the modulation of these signalling cascades and how this contributes to distinct neuronal and behavioural changes in vivo. Associative learning in the honeybee provides the opportunity to study processes of memory formation by analysing its progression through different phases, across levels of behaviour, neural circuits, and cellular signalling pathways. The findings reveal evidence that various cellular signalling pathways in the neuronal circuit of distinct brain areas play a role in different processes during learning and memory formation.","Antennal lobes; Associative learning; Memory; Protein kinases; Second messenger cascades",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036997058

The speed at which the liquid is transferred (unloading rate) from donor to recipient is related to the profitability offered by the recently visited food source. Two of the main characteristics that define food source profitability are the flow of solution delivered by the feeder and the time invested by the forager feeding at the source (feeding time). To investigate which of these two variables is related to unloading rate, we individually trained donor foragers to a regulated-flow feeder that presented changes in the delivered flow of solution within a single foraging bout, while feeding time remained constant. With the range of flows used, bees attained maximum crop loads in all experiments. During the subsequent trophallactic encounter with an unfed recipient hivemate, unloading rate was differentially affected by the changes in flow of solution presented during the previous foraging trip at the source, depending on whether there had been an increase or a decrease of flow rate within that visit. Foragers unloaded at lower rates when they experienced a decrease in flow rate, but did not increase the unloading rate when presented with an increase at the food source. Thus, forager honeybees seem to be able to detect variations in the delivered flow of solution, since they modulate unloading rate in relation to these changes, although decreases in food value seem to be perceptually weighted in relation to increases, independently of the time invested in the food-gathering process. © 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036058908

White clover (Trifolium repens) was a major competing species for honey bees and lupin (Lupinus arboreum) for bumble bees. Bumble bees exhibited a greater degree of crossover between male and female flowers than honey bees, based on an examination of male and female pollen in corbicular loads.

While physiological properties of the input, the olfactory receptor neurons, have become clearer, the operation of the network itself remains cryptic. Therefore we measured spatio-temporal odor-response patterns in the output neurons of the olfactory glomeruli using optical imaging in the honeybee Apis mellifera. We mapped these responses to identified glomeruli, which are the structural and functional units of the AL. Each odor evoked a complex spatio-temporal activity pattern of excited and inhibited glomeruli. These properties were odor- and glomerulus-specific and were conserved across individuals. We compared the spatial pattern of excited glomeruli to previously published signals, which derived mainly from the receptor neurons, and found that they appeared more confined, showing that inhibitory connections enhance the contrast between glomeruli in the AL. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we applied GABA and the GABA-receptor antagonist picrotoxin (PTX). The results show the presence of two separate inhibitory networks: one is GABAergic and modulates overall AL activity, the other is PTX-insensitive and glomerulus-specific. Inhibitory connections of the latter network selectively inhibit glomeruli with overlapping response profiles, in a way akin to ""lateral"" inhibition in other sensory systems. Selectively inhibited glomeruli need not be spatial neighbors. The net result is a globally modulated, contrast-enhanced and predictable representation of odors in the olfactory output neurons.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036092584

These bee species are also compared for the pod set and mature seed that results from their single visits to virgin flowers. Regardless of the identity of the pollinating bee, tripped flowers had the same probabilities of pod set and seed set. Thus, differences in the single-visit pollination efficiencies of the various bee species are entirely attributable to the proportion of visited flowers that they trip.

The following study presents the postmortem findings in three cases of bee sting fatality, including one in which no observable sting was found. An autopsy approach to such cases is detailed. Over-reporting of bee sting-related deaths may occur due to the inclusion of deaths unrelated to a reaction to bee venom, while under-reporting may be due to unexplained deaths where a history of a bee sting is not available or apparent at autopsy. A classification of bee sting-related deaths is proposed, which would allow more accurate reporting of bee sting-related fatalies. A serum tryptase and specific IgE to bee venom on serum obtained at autopsy can assist in confirming anaphylactic reaction to bee venom as the cause of death, particularly in the absence of observable stings. Although there are limitations to the usefulness of serum tryptase tests in the postmortem situation, it may still be useful to confirm suspected anaphylaxis in autopsy cases with an undetermined cause of death.","Anaphylaxis; Bee sting; Bee venom; Fatalities; Tryptase",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035985931

Prior work has shown that the monitoring of contaminants that are returned to a hive by honeybees (Apis mellifera) provides a rapid, inexpensive method to assess chemical distributions and environmental impacts. Members from a single colony make many tens of thousands of foraging trips per day over areas as large as 2 km2. During these foraging trips, the insects are in direct contact with most environmental media (air, water, plants, and soil) and, in the process, encounter contaminants in gaseous, liquid and particulate form. These contaminants are carried back to the hive where analysis can be conveniently conducted. Three decades of work by UM and other investigators has demonstrated that honeybees can effectively and rapidly screen large areas for the presence of a wide array of chemical contaminants and for the effects of exposures to these chemicals. Recently, UM has been exploring how bee-based environmental measurements can be used to quantify risks to humans or ecosystems. The current DARPA program extends this work to the training of honeybees to actively search for contaminants such as the explosive residue that is being released by buried landmines. UM developed the methods to train bees to detect explosives and chemical agent surrogates. Sandia provided the explosives expertise, test facilities, electronics support, and state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation. We will present an overview of the training procedures, test parameters employed, and a summary of the results of field trials that were performed in Montana and at DARPA field trials in San Antonio, TX. Data showing the detection limits of the insects will be included.","Bee; Detection; Environmental; Explosiv e detection; Explosives; Honeybee; Landmines; Stand-off detection; Training",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036442781

Each of these Apoidea is well attracted by pollen of maize. The larger number of bees foraging at the same time on a panicle varies from one with D. staudingeri to four with L.andrei and L. notabilis. Generally, bees forage maize during the whole day and during the full flowering period but visits are more numerous in the morning and during the period of intense flowering. Median duration of a visit on a male spikelet varies from 1 sec with D. staudingeri to 7 sec with L. andrei. These Apoidea have an elaborated behaviour when gathering pollen of maize. D. staudingeri however seems less adapted to the floral morphology of Poaceae comparing with Lipotriches. When foraging maize, all these bees are regular visitors to flowers of this plant, even in the presence of other flower species in the vicinity of the crop. Bees studied have a positive impact on the yield of grains due to a complementary action with the well known one of the wind. The influence is indirect as the bees are seldom visiting the stigmates. The explanation is that when the bees are very common on the panicles they shake the anthers, inducing the release of pollen grains in the atmosphere even in the days without wind. The part of wild bees in the increase of yields is estimated to 3% while the one of the domestic bees (Apis mellifera) is estimated to 21% in that locality. The authors are reviewing existing literature on grass crop pollination and on Poaceae in general by various species of bees. For a better integrated crop management of maize in Cameroon, it is suggested to conserve the nesting sites of Lipotriches in surrounding areas of crops and to avoid unjustified use of pesticides during the flowering period. © 2002 FAC UNIV SCIENCES AGRONOMIQUES GEMBLOUX.

The plants were sprayed three times (a week interval) with rose water (contained terpene alcohols) at the stage of opening of 5% of inflorescence flowers during 1997 and 1998 growing seasons. A wide range of insect species visited the umbels of rose water sprayed plants, mainly honeybee (Apis mellifera L.), blowfly (Caliphora vomitoria L.), and housefly (Musca domestica L.), and spraying vegetative part, inflorescence or whole plant revealed similar attractiveness to the insects. Spraying rose water also extended the touch time of the insects on the umbel from 4.5 seconds for untreated to 11.5 seconds for treated plants resulting in a higher percentage of flower set and lower number of aborted flowers in all tested cultivars. Among the plants part treated, the sprayed inflorescence had higher number of seeds (capsule-1) and higher percentage of seed yield increase (46.1% and 43.8% for Texas Grano 502, 59.5% and 35.6% for Local Red, and 64.8% and 43.1% for Local White cultivars in 1997 and 1998 seasons respectively).

Pipers are excited bees which scramble through the swarm cluster, pausing every second or so to emit a pipe. Each pipe consists of a sound pulse which lasts 0.82±0.43 s and rises in fundamental frequency from 100-200 Hz to 200-250 Hz. Many, if not all, of the pipers are nest-site scouts. The scouts pipe when it is time to stimulate the non-scouts to warm themselves to a flight-ready temperature (35°C) in preparation for liftoff. The time-course of worker piping matches that of swarm warming; both start at a low level, about an hour before liftoff, and both build to a climax at liftoff. When we excluded pipers from bees hanging in the cool, outermost layer of a swarm cluster, we found that these bees did not warm up. The form of worker piping that we have studied in swarms differs from the form of worker piping that others have studied in hives. We call the two forms ""wings-together piping"" (in swarms) and ""wings-apart piping"" (in hives).","Communication; Honey Bee; Sound; Swarming; Worker piping",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035205514

The color and luminance contrasts were identical for all targets. Our results confirm the importance of size. However, we demonstrate for the first time, that full circular shapes have the greatest maximal detection distance among targets of equal diameters, and even more than dissected targets with equal Acol and double D. The parameter Acol 2/C was found as the best predictor of maximal detection distance of vertically presented targets with varying diameter and degree of dissection for honeybee workers. We propose that an increase in the colored area and decrease in contour line is advantageous due to the fact that it increases the amount of contrast that the target as a whole produces against its background.","Detection distance; Floral shape parameters; Honeybee; Vision",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035212231

Conspecifics use these marks to distinguish those flowers that have recently been emptied and, so, avoid them. The aim of this study was to assess how widespread this behavior is. Evidence for direct detection of reward levels was found in two bee species: Agapostemon nasutus was able to detect directly pollen availability in flowers with exposed anthers, while Apis mellifera appeared to be able to detect nectar levels of tubular flowers. A third species, Trigona fulviventris, avoided flowers that had recently been visited by conspecifies, regardless of reward levels, probably by using scent marks. Three further bee/flower systems were examined in which there was no detectable discrimination among flowers. We argue that bees probably rely on direct detection of rewards where this is allowed by the structure of the flower and on scent marks when feeding on flowers where the rewards are hidden. However, discrimination does not always occur. We suggest that discrimination may not always make economic sense; when visiting flowers with a low handling time, or fiowers that are scarce, it may be more efficient to visit every flower that is encountered.","Apoidea; Efficiency; Foraging; Handling time; Nectar; Pollen",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035202017

Immediately after leaving, the queen workers which had licked the queen, self-groomed longer and more frequently than workers which had antennated the queen.

The present study investigated the dependence of haemolymph sugar levels in foraging honeybees on metabolic rate and whether the haemolymph sugar level is regulated. Free-flying foraging bees were trained to collect controlled amounts of sucrose solution of different concentrations (15 %, 30 % or 50 % sucrose w/w). Immediately after feeding, metabolic rate was measured over a given time depending on the sucrose concentration, then crop-emptying rate and haemolymph sugar levels were measured. Bees exhibiting a wide range of metabolic rates were compared to establish whether the observed differences in haemolymph sugar levels were due to limits in the supply of sugars from the crop or in the rate of trehalose synthesis in the fat bodies. Independent of the concentration of the sucrose solution supplied, haemolymph trehalose, glucose and fructose levels were constant for metabolic rates from 0 to 4.5ml CO2h-1. At higher metabolic rates, trehalose concentration decreased while that of glucose and fructose increased, with the exception of bees fed 15 % sucrose solution. As the supply of sugar from the crop via the proventriculus was sufficient to support even the highest metabolic rates, the observed pattern must result from an upper limit in the capacity of the fat body to synthesise trehalose. The maximal rate of conversion of glucose to trehalose in the fat body was therefore calculated to average 92.4 μg glucose min-1. However, for bees fed 15 % sucrose solution both the rate of conversion of glucose to trehalose and the rate of sugar transport from the crop to the ventricle were limited, together resulting in a decrease in total haemolymph sugar levels for metabolic rates higher than 5 ml CO2 h-1.","Apis mellifera carnica; Haemolymph sugar; Honeybee; Metabolism; Proventriculus; Trehalose",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035745784

For those colonies identified as most resistant and least resistant, cuticular chemicals were extracted in hexane from frozen, newly emerged worker bees. These extracts were presented to individual tracheal mites in pairwise fashion in a laboratory bioassay. The results demonstrated that mites prefer extracts of bees from some colonies more than others, however, no consistent differences were demonstrated.

[Hymenoptera: Apidae]) infested with the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Anderson) (Acari: Varroidae) were all negatively correlated with increasing numbers of mites. It was estimated that for every female mite present during the bees' development, the host would lose three percent of its body water. Parasitised bees also emerged with lower head and abdomen concentrations of protein and with lower abdominal carbohydrate concentrations. Lipid concentrations were not detectably affected by V. destructor infestation. The losses of metabolic reserves were not, however, judged to be serious enough to be directly responsible for the high bee mortality and ultimate colony collapse that are associated with the arrival of Varroa in a hive. Some 8.5% of the emerging bees exhibited morphological deformities and deformity was positively correlated with increasing numbers of mites in brood cells. Deformed bees were, however, found in all categories of parasitosis, suggesting that other factors, such as infectious agents, may be involved. Mites that fed on either live or dead U14C- labelled bees acquired the label within 24 h and it was calculated that an adult female mite consumes 0.67 μ1 haemolymph 24 h-1. It was also demonstrated that 14C was transmitted to a previously non-radio-labelled bee when a mite that had been feeding on a labelled bee changed hosts.

As an agonist of the acetylcholine receptor, it attacks the insect nervous system and is extremely effective against various sucking and mining pests. Oral acute and chronic toxicity of imidacloprid and its main metabolites (5-hydroxyimidacloprid, 4,5-dihydroxyimidacloprid, desnitroimidacloprid, 6-chloronicotinic acid, olefin, and urea derivative) were investigated in Apis mellifera. Acute intoxication by imidacloprid or its metabolites resulted in the rapid appearance of neurotoxicity symptoms, such as hyperresponsiveness, hyperactivity, and trembling and led to hyporesponsiveness and hypoactivity. For acute toxicity tests, bees were treated with doses of toxic compounds ranging from 1 to 1,000 ng/bee (10-10,000 μg/kg). Acute toxicity (LD50) values of imidacloprid were about 60 ng/bee (600 μg/kg) at 48 h and about 40 ng/bee (400 μg/kg) at 72 and 96 h. Out of the six imidacloprid metabolites tested, only two (5-hydroxyimidacloprid and olefin) exhibited a toxicity close to that of imidacloprid. Olefin LD50 values were lower than those of imidacloprid. The 5-hydroxyimidacloprid showed a lower toxicity than imidacloprid with a LD50 four to six times higher than that of imidacloprid. Urea also appeared as a compound of nonnegligible toxicity by eliciting close to 40% mortality at 1,000 ng/bee (10,000 μg/kg). However, no significant toxicity was observed with 4,5-dihydroxyimidacloprid, 6-chloronicotinic acid, and desnitroimidacloprid in the range of doses tested. To test chronic toxicity, worker bees were fed sucrose solutions containing 0.1, 1, and 10 μg/L of imidacloprid and its metabolites for 10 d. Fifty percent mortality was reached at approximately 8 d. Hence, considering that sucrose syrup was consumed at the mean rate of 12 μl/d and per bee, after an 8-d period the cumulated doses were approximately 0.01, 0.1, and 1 ng/bee (0.1, 1, and 10 μg/kg). Thus, all tested compounds were toxic at doses 30 to 3,000 (olefin), 60 to 6,000 (imidacloprid), 200 to 20,000 (5-OH-imidacloprid), and > 1,000 to 100,000 (remaining metabolites) times lower than those required to produce the same effect in acute intoxication studies.

Colonies were housed in vertical, three-frame observation hives situated inside a building, with entrances leading to the exterior. Before receiving treatments, all colonies were deprived of pollen for 5 days and pollen foragers were marked. In one treatment group, colony pollen reserves were quantitatively manipulated to a low or high level, either by starving colonies of pollen or by providing them with a fully provisioned frame of pollen composed of mixed species. In another treatment group, pollen reserves were qualitatively manipulated by removing pollen stores from colonies and replacing them with low- or high-protein pollen supplements. After applying treatments, foraging rates were measured four times per day and pollen pellets were collected from experienced and inexperienced foragers to determine their weight, species composition, and protein content. Honeybee colonies responded to decreases in the quantity or quality of pollen reserves by increasing the proportion of pollen foragers in their foraging populations, without increasing the overall foraging rate. Manipulation of pollen stores had no effect on the breadth of floral species collected by colonies, or their preferences for the size or protein content of pollen grains. In addition, treatments had no effect on the weight of pollen loads collected by individual foragers or the number of floral species collected per foraging trip. However, significant changes in foraging behavior were detected in relation to the experience level of foragers. Irrespective of treatment group, inexperienced foragers exerted greater effort by collecting heavier pollen loads and also sampled their floral environment more extensively than experienced foragers. Overall, our results indicate that honeybees respond to deficiencies in the quantity or quality of their pollen reserves by increasing the gross amount of pollen returned to the colony, rather than by specializing in collecting pollen with a greater protein content. Individual pollen foragers appear to be insensitive to the quality of pollen they collect, indicating that colony-level feedback is necessary to regulate the flow of protein to and within the colony. Colonies may respond to changes in the quality of their pollen stores by adjusting the numbers of inexperienced to experienced foragers within their foraging populations.","Apis mellifera; Nutrition; Pollen foraging behavior; Pollen quality; Protein content",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035785263

Thus, immature drones are more likely to be infested with mites than immature workers. To investigate the hypothesis that differences in host chemistries underlie the biased distribution of mites between worker and drone brood, the arrestment responses of mites to solvent extracts of a number of stimuli normally encountered by a mite during its life cycle were measured. Mites were arrested by cuticular extracts of worker and drone larvae obtained at 0, 24 and 48 h prior to the time when cell capping is completed. Mites were also arrested by extracts of worker and drone, brood food and cocoons, and by a blend of synthetic fatty acid esters previously shown to be active in the host acquisition process. In a wind tunnel bioassay, mites were attracted to odours from living fifth-instar worker and drone larvae, but not to volatiles from cocoons, brood food or a blend of fatty acid esters. The sex of the host was not an important factor affecting the behavioural responses of the mites in any assay. We conclude that host kairomones play a role in the host acquisition process, but we found no evidence to support the hypothesis that mites use these substances to differentiate between worker and drone brood.","Apis mellifera; Arrestant; Attractant; Chemical ecology; Honey bee; Host acquisition; Kairomone; Parasitic mite; Varroa destructor; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035673703

Treatments included extracts of Dufour's gland secretion as well as the synthetic esters that were identified in the secretion. Policing was clearly detected both in queenright and queenless colonies by the swift removal of worker, but not of queen eggs. However, neither the glandular secretion nor its synthetic ester constituents were able to protect worker-born eggs from policing. Treated worker eggs were removed significantly faster than queen eggs, and at the same rate as non-treated worker eggs. These results are not consistent with the hypothesis that the secretion serves as an egg-marking pheromone. Chemical analyses of the queen abdominal tips revealed the presence of Dufour's esters, indicating that the glandular secretion oozes out and spreads over the cuticle around the genital chamber. However, contamination while ovipositing may also explain the minute amounts of these esters that were detected on the egg surface. Dufour's gland caste-specific composition suggests that in queens it may constitute a signal that plays a role in queen-worker interactions. Attraction bioassays revealed that the queen secretion, but not that of workers, is very attractive to workers. When applied either on a glass slide or on another worker, a retinue formed around the ""surrogate queen"".

The construction of specific inbred crosses facilitates fine scale mapping in the sex locus region of the honey bee. The high recombination rate in the honey bee reduces the physical distance between markers compared with model organisms and facilitates a novel gene isolation strategy based on step-wise creation of new markers within small physical distances.

This study uses behavioural tests and electroanntennography to assess the role of chemostimuli in recognition by honey bees of this acarian ectoparasite. Behavioural tests using living or dead parasites involved observation of honey bee grooming activity (antennation) under controlled conditions in Petri dishes, and removal behaviour (uncapping and elimination of parasitized and unparasitized control brood cells) under natural conditions. Some bees from colonies with both small and large parasite populations showed aggressive behaviour (biting). No difference was observed according to whether the mite was dead or alive. Under natural conditions, bees uncapped more parasitized cells than control cells. Electroantennographic tests were performed to measure sensitivity to various Varroa extracts at three concentrations (10, 20 and 30 Varroa Equivalents). Only 30 Varroa Equivalent methanol extracts made from Varroa collected from brood cells elicited significantly greater antennal response than controls (pure solvent). All three methanol extracts elicited significantly greater antennal response than controls. No response was observed using Varroa extracts made with acetone or hexane. These findings suggest that polar products may act as chemostimuli for recognition of V. destructor by honey bees. Further study will be necessary to determine which polar products are involved in this recognition and assess grooming and removal behaviour using these products.","Apis mellifera; Electroantennography; Grooming behaviour; Host-parasite interaction; Removal behaviour; Varroa destructor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035670324

Number of bee-eater colonies increased with number of food sources (hives and apiaries); conversely total bird population and colony size were not related to food sources. Bee-eaters preyed on bees (foragers) in relation to their mean total availability (calculated over all study areas), but predation on bees occurred also where hives were absent or far away. By contrast, predation on drones was negatively correlated to their mean total availability. Indeed, predation on foragers and drones correlated negatively. Predation impact on foragers was on average 0.37% (range: 0.26-0.58%) of their mean total availability during May-July. The daily forager mortality per hive due to bee-eater predation represented on average 6.1% (n = 73) of their total daily mortality per hive. Predation pressure on drones was on average 0.91% (range: 0.27-1.43%) of their mean total availability during May-July. The daily drone mortality per hive due to bee-eater predation represented on average 30% (n = 4) of their total daily mortality per hive. Predation impact by bee-eaters on foragers was independent from prey density. Conversely, predation on drones was inversely dependent from prey density, thus it was diluted at high hive densities. The economic impact on apiculture by bee-eaters was in general negligible, but losses of drones were locally important and potentially detrimental to small or specialized apicultures.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035703602

The pollinating entomofauna present on both plant species was compared in a preliminary study. Two trials were conducted. At site A, the trial consisted of an area of oilseed rape (780m2), including 1m 2 of wild radish in the centre. At site B, there was a 750m 2 area of wild radish, including some plants of oilseed rape. The insect diversity, abundance and foraging behaviour (number of flowers visited /min) were observed on both sites simultaneously. Moreover, at site A, the movement of insects between both plant species were observed in the central place by several methods (individual observation, passing ratio of a foraging population during 3 minutes, flower constancy and avoidance of wild radish). In addition, some parameters of floral attractiveness were assessed (flower density, morphology, pollen and nectar production) to understand insect preference for one of the plant species. The results showed both plants had the same flower density at full flowering but differed in their floral morphology and did not offer equal quantities of food (wild radish had deeper and narrower corolla, smaller petals, less pollen and more variable amounts of nectar). Both plants were attractive to pollinators but to differing degrees, depending on the insect taxon. Wild radish was significantly less visited by honeybees. With regard to the risk of pollen transfer between the two species, results showed that when honeybees were foraging on an area predominantly planted with oilseed rape (site A), they avoided wild radish because of their high flower constancy. The constancy of bumblebees differed between species: Bombus terrestris were more constant to oilseed rape, whereas Bombus lapidarius were more constant to wild radish. This led to a relatively low frequency of movement between plant species although bumblebees visited flowers at a higher rate than any other pollinators. Solitary bees and flies seemed to be indifferent to the plant species. The role of each insect group in pollen transfer between oilseed rape and wild radish is discussed with regard to its relative density and foraging behaviour.","Herbicide resistance; Honeybee; Insect pollination; Interspecific hybridisation; Transgenic oilseed rape; Wild radish",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34548433762

In the case of honeybees, foragers returning from a nectar source transfer the food collected to receiver colony-mates through oral contact. Previous studies have shown that the speed of nectar transfer within each contact (unloading rate) increases when foragers return from feeding sites with higher profitability, i.e. with more concentrated sugar solutions or higher solution flow rates. However, there is no evidence that the nectar unloading rate is actually evaluated by hive-mates during food exchange. To investigate this, trophallaxis between donor bees returning from a feeder with different flow rates of sucrose solution (range 1.0-8.2 μl min-1 of 50 % w/w sucrose solution) and receiver hive-mates was studied by combining behavioural and infrared thermal analysis. The results show that when foraging bees returned from a feeder delivering a higher flow rate they initiated unloading at higher thoracic temperatures and transferred the solution at higher speed. During these food exchanges, the thoraces of receiver bees warmed up faster in proportion to increasing forager temperature and unloading rate. Therefore, whatever the variable actually evaluated by receivers (mostly nectar processors, i.e. bees that handle nectar in the hive) during trophallaxis (unloading rate and/or donor thoracic temperature), they raised their activity level in proportion to that of the foragers. In this way, receiver bees will intensify their nectar processing when nectar foragers return from more profitable sites.","Apis mellifera carnica; Foraging; Honeybee; Information transfer; Profitability; Thermography; Trophallaxis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035744945

An alternative signal could be the vibrations of the comb at 200-300 Hz generated by dancing bees but which, without amplification, may not be large enough to alert remote dance-followers. We describe here, however, an unexpected property of honeycomb when it is subjected to vibration at around 200 Hz that would represent an effective amplification of the vibratory signals for remote dance-followers. We find that, at a specific distance from the origin of an imposed vibration, the walls across a single comb cell abruptly reverse the phase of their displacement and move in opposite directions to one another. Behavioural measurements show that the distance from which the majority of remote dance-followers are recruited coincides with the location of this phase-reversal phenomenon relative to the signal source. We propose that effective signal amplification by the phase-reversal phenomenon occurs when bees straddle a cell across which the phase reversal is expressed. Such a bee would be subjected to a situation in which the legs were moving towards and away from one another instead of in the same direction. In this manner, remote dance-followers could be alerted to a dancer performing in their vicinity.","Apis mellifera carnica; Communication; Honeybee; Honeycomb vibration; Recruitment; Waggle dance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035746161

To understand how the bee achieves thermal stability at different reward rates, the metabolic rates of undisturbed foraging bees were measured at different Ta values and different sucrose solution flow rates. Metabolic heat production, calculated from the rate of carbon dioxide production, decreased linearly from 49.7 to 23.4 mW as Ta increased from 19 to 29°C (sucrose flow rate 1.75 μl min-1, 50% w/w). In contrast, crop load and inspection rate remained constant. Metabolic rate displayed a linear relationship with both Ta and the logarithm of the flow rate of sucrose solution (range analyzed 0.44-13.1 μl min-1, 50% w/w). Metabolic rate decreased by 3.13±0.52 mW (mean ± S.E.M., N=37) for every 1°C increase in Ta and increased by 4.36±1.13 mW for a doubling in flow rate. These changes in metabolic power output might be used to achieve thermal stability during foraging. It is suggested that the foraging bee might increase its Tth in accordance with the reward rate.","Apis mellifera ligustica; Flight energetics; Foraging; Honeybee; Motivation; Thermoregulation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035746138

In this study, we investigate the effects of parasitic tracheal mites (Acarapis woodi) on the safety margin for oxygen delivery and flight performance of honeybees. Tracheal mites did not affect the flight metabolic rate of honeybees in normoxic (21% oxygen) or hyperoxic (40% oxygen) air, but did reduce their metabolic rate relative to uninfected bees when flying in hypoxic air (5 or 10% oxygen), demonstrating that mites reduced the safety margin for tracheal oxygen delivery. The negative effects of mites on flight metabolic rate in hypoxic atmospheres were graded with the number of mites per trachea. For example, in 10% oxygen atmospheres, flight metabolic rate was reduced by 20% by moderate mite infection and by 40% by severe mite infection. Thus, the safety margin for oxygen delivery in honeybees allows them to retain normal flight metabolic rate and behavior despite tracheal mite infection under most conditions. However, the reduction in tracheal gas-exchange capacity may constrain activities requiring the highest metabolic rates, such as flying in cool weather. In support of this hypothesis, bees that were unable to return to the hive during late-winter flights showed significantly higher levels of mite infection than bees that returned safely.","Acarapis woodi; Apis mellifera; Honeybee; Metabolic rate; Oxygen delivery; Safety margin; Symmorphosis; Temperature; Tracheal mite",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035745929

The beetles invade bee colonies and lay eggs inside them. Both larvae and adults feed on brood, pollen, wax, honey, and damage both the brood and honeycomb. When small hive beetle infestations are heavy and even if the colony is strong, queens will stop laying eggs and the bees often leave the hive. Mature larvae enter soil to pupate.

As bumblebees play an important role in the pollination of many entomophilous crops, this decline could impact on agricultural productivity. We examined the role of naturally regenerated field margins in providing forage plants on land where nectar resources are otherwise impoverished. The following question was addressed - Are naturally regenerated unsprayed field margins more attractive to foraging bumblebees and honeybees than cropped field margins managed as conservation headlands? Significantly more bees visited naturally regenerated field margins than cropped field margins. Honeybees (Apis mellifera), Bombus terrestris, and Bombus lapidarius were the most commonly observed bee species.

The Altitudinal forest of Northeast Brazil, locally known as ""Brejos de Altitude"", occurs in altitudes above 500m and is located in the countryside where the landscape is mostly composed of Caatinga vegetation, forming ""islands"" of Atlantic forest inside the Caatinga. The present study was conducted in a fragment of those ""Brejos"", in the district of Caruaru, Pernambuco State, Northeast Brazil (8-18'36"" S, 36-00'00'' W). The main focus was to study the diversity of bees and their floral resources, including flower phenology. The bees were captured every two weeks, between May 1998 and January 2000. Sixty-seven species of bee plants from 29 families were listed. The most representative ones were: Fabaceae (10 spp.), Convolvulaceae (7), Asteraceae (5), Caesalpiniaceae (3), Melastomataceae (3), Mimosaceae (3) and Passifloraceae (3). Concerning the bees, 544 individuals (101 species) were captured. Six families were registered: Anthophoridae (54 spp.), Apidae (13), Megachilidae (13), Halictidae (12), Colletidae (5) and Andrenidae (4). Considering the fact that the study site is in a fragmented, isolated and discontinuous area, the richness of bees was high. In the study area, Apis mellifera visited preferentially cultivated plants like Sechium edule Swaart (Curcubitaceae), thus there was low overlap concerning the forage behaviour of this bee compared to the other bee species.","Altitudinal forest; Bee diversity; Bee plants; Mellitophily; Phenology; Wild bee fauna",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33645719835

The results demonstrate that forager workers display behavioral responses when exposed to Dufour gland extracts of nestmates, but remain indifferent when exposed to non-nestmate extracts. Also, the results demonstrate that forager workers are attracted by virgin queen gland extracts, and repelled by forager worker extracts. The data demonstrate that the Dufour gland secretion is colony-and caste-specific. The attractant remains in the nest. The repellent effect of forager worker extracts is interpreted as an alarm-like pheromone. The attractant effect of virgin queen extracts could be useful in the swarming process to attract scout bees to the eventual founder virgin queen or to attract old foragers to the virgin queen that remains in the nest.","Apis mellifera; Behavioral response; Dufour gland; Forager worker; Pheromone",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035645857

Brood production was numerically highest in colonies treated exclusively with a bottom screen. Varroa populations were significantly reduced in colonies receiving acaricide compared to non-treated colonies. Varroa populations in colonies treated exclusively with a bottom screen were 14.9% lower than that of non-treated colonies, but this difference was not significant. The bottom screen did not affect the percentage of varroa mite population phoretic on adult bees. Apistan provided 100% mite control in South Carolina, whereas in Georgia it provided 0% control in colonies treated exclusively with Apistan. With the addition of a bottom screen, Apistan-treated colonies in Georgia experienced an average mite control of 44.3%. This suggests that fluvalinate resistance exists in Georgia varroa mites. It also indicates that a bottom screen may help compensate for reduced acaricide efficacy.

We have discovered that the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) from the venom of the eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus) inhibits oocyst formation when added to infected chicken blood and fed to mosquitoes. A similar transmission-blocking activity was demonstrated for PLA2s from the venom of other snakes and from the honeybee. This effect is seen both with the avian malaria parasite Plasmodium gallinaceum and with the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum developing in their respective mosquito hosts. The inhibition occurs even in the presence of an irreversible inhibitor of the active site of PLA2, indicating that the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme is not required for the antiparasitic effect. Inhibition is also seen when the enzyme is fed to mosquitoes together with ookinetes, suggesting that the inhibition occurs after ookinete maturation. PLA2 has no direct effect on the parasite. However, pretreatment of midguts with PLA2 (catalytically active or inactive) dramatically lowers the level of ookinete/midgut association in vitro. It appears, therefore, that PLA2 is acting by associating with the midgut surface and preventing ookinete attachment to this surface. Thus, PLA2 is an excellent candidate for expression in transgenic mosquitoes as a means of inhibiting the transmission of malaria.","Aedes aegypti; Crotalus adamanteus; Eastern diamondback rattlesnake; Malaria; Ookinete; P-bromophenacyl bromide; Phospholipase; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium gallinaceum; Transmission blocking",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035745806

Recently, we have determined high resolution solution structures of two inhibitors Apis mellifera chymotrypsin inhibitor-1 (AMCI-I) and Linum usitatissimum trypsin inhibitor (LUTI) in the free state and an ultra high resolution X-ray structure of BPTI. All three inhibitors, despite totally different scaffolds, contain a solvent exposed loop of similar conformation which is highly complementary to the enzyme active site. Isothermal calorimetry data show that the interaction between wild type BPTI and chymotrypsin is entropy driven and that the enthalpy component opposes complex formation. Our research is focused on extensive mutagenesis of the four positions from the protease binding loop of BPTI: P1, P1′, P3, and P4. We mutated these residues to different amino acids and the variants were characterized by determination of the association constants, stability parameters and crystal structures of protease-inhibitor complexes. Accommodation of the P1 residue in the S1 pocket of four proteases: chymotrypsin, trypsin, neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G was probed with 18 P1 variants. High resolution X-ray structures of ten complexes between bovine trypsin and P1 variants of BPTI have been determined and compared with the cognatee P1 Lys side chain. Mutations of the wild type Ala16 (P1′) to larger side chains always caused a drop of the association constant. According to the crystal structure of the Leu16 BPTI-trypsin complex, introduction of the larger residue at the P1′ position leads to steric conflicts in the vicinity of the mutation.

We studied bees' generalisation behaviour with odours having different biological values: typical floral odours or alarm compounds. Bees' behavioural and peripheral electrophysiological responses were investigated using a combined proboscis extension response conditioning-electroantennogram assay. Bees were conditioned to pure linalool (floral) or to pure isoamyl acetate (alarm) and were tested with different concentrations of both compounds. Electrophysiological responses were not influenced by conditioning, suggesting that the learning of individual compounds does not rely on modulations of peripheral sensitivity. Behaviourally, generalisation responses of bees conditioned to the alarm compound were much higher than those of bees conditioned to the floral odour. We further demonstrated such asymmetrical generalisation between alarm and floral odours by using differential conditioning procedures. Conditioning to alarm compounds (isoamyl acetate or 2-heptanone) consistently induced more generalisation than conditioning to floral compounds (linalool or phenylacetaldehyde). Interestingly, generalisation between the two alarm compounds, which are otherwise chemically different, was extremely high. These results are discussed in relation to the neural representation of compounds with different biological significance for bees.","Alarm pheromones; Electroantennogram; Generalisation; Olfactory learning; Proboscis extension response conditioning",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035175506

Five days of non-foraging led to cannibalism of larvae younger than 3 days old and to a shortening of the time until larvae were sealed, but 4- and 5-day-old larvae survived even worse pollen supply situations. Manual pollen removal and reduction of income (pollen trap) induced cannibalism of younger larvae. The larvae's mean capping age significantly correlated with the mean pollen income: the less pollen was stored by the hive during the larvae's development, the earlier the larvae were capped. Both behavioral patterns lead to a quick reduction in the amount of unsealed older brood in response to a shortage of available protein. Older larvae have the highest pollen demand, so this strategy compensates for a shortage of supply by reducing demand. Additionally worker jelly gets enriched by protein gained from cannibalism, and the early capping of older larvae saves the oldest part of the brood, which represents the highest broodcare investment.","Cannibalism; Honeybees; Pollen shortages; Survival rates; Unsealed brood",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035162211

However, in this study, Dinizia exelsa (Fabaceae), a canopy-emergent tree, was found to thrive in Amazonian pastures and forest fragments even in the absence of native pollinators. Canopy observations indicated that African honeybees (Apis mellifera scutellata) were the predominant floral visitors in fragmented habitats and replaced native insects in isolated pasture trees. Trees in habitat fragments produced, on average, over three times as many seeds as trees in continuous forest, and microsatellite assays of seed arrays showed that genetic diversity was maintained across habitats. A paternity analysis further revealed gene flow over as much as 3.2 km of pasture, the most distant pollination precisely recorded for any plant species. Usually considered only as dangerous exotics, African honeybees have become important pollinators in degraded tropical forests, and may alter the genetic structure of remnant populations through frequent long-distance gene flow.","Amazonia; Apis mellifera; Dinizia exelsa; Habitat fragmentation; Microsatellite; Paternity inference",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035935673

Groups of bees were treated at the beginning of the pupal stage with the juvenile hormone analog pyriproxyfen (PPN) or as pharate adults with 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). Another group was treated with both hormones applied successively at these same developmental periods. Controls were maintained without treatment. The epidermal proteins, separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by silver staining, were studied at seven intervals during the pupal and pharate adult stages. The initiation and progress of cuticular pigmentation was also monitored and compared to controls. The results showed that PPN reduced the interval of expression of some epidermal proteins, whereas 20E had an antagonistic effect, promoting a prolongation in the time of expression of the same proteins. In PPN-treated bees, cuticular pigmentation started precociously, whereas in 20E-treated individuals this developmental event was postponed. The double hormonal treatment restored the normal progress of cuticular pigmentation and, to a large extent, the temporal epidermal protein pattern.

JH titers were correlated with aggressive behavior at two levels. First, winter bees and summer nurses, known to have lower JH titers, both showed less aggression toward foreign bees than did summer guards. Second, aggressive individuals had significantly higher JH titers than did non-aggressive bees within each colony. Inter-colonial variation in aggressiveness was maintained during summer and winter, suggesting a genetic basis for these differences. An alarm pheromone test further substantiated the existence of inter-colonial differences. We found significant variation in JH titers among different colonies, but this variation was not significantly associated with colony-level aggressiveness.

Random amplified polymorphic DNA markers were scored from recombinant, haploid drone progeny that showed extreme manifestations of learning performance. Composite interval mapping procedures identified two QTLs for reversal learning (lrn2 and lrn3: LOD, 2.45 and 2.75, respectively) and one major QTL for latent inhibition (lrn1: LOD, 6.15). The QTL for latent inhibition did not map to either of the linkage groups that were associated with reversal learning.

In addition, these venoms were tested on rat whole blood in order to determine their ability to induce red blood cell haemolysis. The main toxic effects on isolated toad heart were monitored by ECG after perfusion with different concentrations of each bee venom, and are represented as a decrease in the heart rate (HR) accompanied by an elongation in the P-R interval. A gradual and progressive increase in R-wave amplitude was also noted. Several electrocardiographic changes were noted 5-30 min after envenomation with any of the bee venoms. The mechanism of action of the three bee venoms was determined by direct application of atropine, nicotine, or verapamil to the isolated toad hearts. Comparison of the three venoms revealed that Anthophora pauperata venom is the most effective venom in inducing bradycardia, and it has the strongest negative dromotropic effect. Apis mellifera venom demonstrates the most positive inotropic effect of the three venoms. The effects of bee venom on the blood indices of erythrocyte osmotic fragility (EOF) and plasma albumin levels were studied after incubation of rat blood with each venom. It was noticed that RBCs decreased while Hb content, HCT, MCV, MCH, and MCHC increased, although this change did fluctuate and was not significant. A nonsignificant decrease in EOF was noted after 60 min with any of the venoms used. Incubation of rat whole blood with 1 μg/ml of any of the bee venom solutions revealed a highly significant decrease in plasma albumin levels. It can be concluded that venoms from the three species of bees we tested have negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects on isolated toad heart, with Anthophora pauperata being the most potent. In addition, the venoms have positive inotropic effects with Apis mellifera being the most potent. The nonsignificant effects of venom on blood profiles and erythrocyte osmotic fragility, combined with the significant decrease in plasma albumin level suggest a protective effect of plasma albumin against bee venom induced toxicity to erythrocytes.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034782229

Previous research has shown that the development of an endogenous rhythm of activity is also seen in the laboratory in a constant environment. Newly emerging bees maintained in isolation are typically arrhythmic during the first few days of adult life and develop strong circadian rhythms by about a few days of age. In addition, average daily levels of period (per) mRNA in the brain are higher in foragers or forager-age bees (> 21 days of age) relative to young nest bees (∼ 7 days of age). The authors used social manipulations to uncouple behavioral rhythmicity, age, and task to determine the relationship between these factors and per. There was no obligate link between average daily levels of per brain mRNA and either behavioral rhythmicity or age. There also were no differences in per brain mRNA levels between nurse bees and foragers in social environments that promote precocious or reversed behavioral development. Nurses and other hive-age bees can have high or low levels of per mRNA levels in the brain, depending on the social environment, while foragers and foraging-age bees always have high levels. These findings suggest a link between honey bee foraging behavior and per up-regulation.

The ecto-parasitic mite Varroa destructor is a serious world-wide pest of the honeybee Apis mellifera and has being linked with the death of millions of colonies, although its role in colony death has remained elusive. 2. A simulation model was developed to explain the link between the mite and collapse of the host bee colony, given that colony death does not always occur. We investigated the effects of two pathogens, deformed wing virus (DWV) and acute paralysis virus (APV), vectored by the mite, on the host colony. 3. Two previously published simulation models, a bee and a mite, were combined and adapted for use in temperate climates with a variety of bee diseases. The model was constructed using Modelmaker® software, which allows the progression of a disease in the host colony to be followed daily. 4. The population dynamics generated by the model were similar to those observed in a natural honeybee colony. When DWV- or APV-transmitting mites were introduced into the colony, its adult worker bee population collapsed either during winter or spring for DWV, or autumn to spring for APV. This corresponds well with field observations of colony death in Europe. 5. The model revealed that DWV initially had little effect on the colony but during late summer, as the population of DWV-transmitting mites increased, the virus caused a reduction in the number of healthy young bees entering the overwintering population. This imbalance in the age structure of the overwintering bees resulted in the eventual death of the colony during the winter or spring. As few as 2000-3600 mites in autumn could kill a colony. 6. In contrast, APV transmitted by Varroa was only able to kill the honeybee colony if a large (10 000+) mite population was already present when an overt APV infection occurred. It was difficult for APV to become established within the bee population due to it causing rapid host death. 7. The model predicts that the less virulent DWV will become more widely established than the highly virulent APV, and that mite control measures need to be taken prior to the production of overwintering bees.","Apis mellifera; Bee viruses; Colony collapse; Disease; Varroa destructor; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034775340

To help evaluate the worth of alternative pollinators in agriculture, we present a theoretical framework for comparing the effectiveness of two or more pollinators by measuring pollen removal and deposition. 2. We report pollen removal and deposition data by Apis mellifera and Bombus spp. during single visits to four cultivars of apples (Golden Delicious, Starkrimson Delicious, Empire/MacIntosh and Rome) and Mission almond. 3. Apis and Bombus removed similar amounts of pollen from apple flowers but Bombus deposited more pollen on stigmas. Pollen-collecting bees removed more pollen from apple anthers than nectar-collecting bees. Apis that approached nectaries laterally deposited substantially less pollen than other visitors. 4. Apis and Bombus removed and deposited similar amounts of pollen on almond flowers. Apis tended to remove more during pollen-collecting visits than nectar-collecting visits. The type of resource sought did not significantly influence deposition. 5. Based on removal and deposition data, additions of Bombus may increase pollen delivery in apple orchards but reduce pollen delivery in almond orchards if Apis already serve as primary pollinators. Additional data on inter-tree and inter-row flights would be necessary to know how much these changes in pollen transfer might affect fertilization. 6. Measures of pollen-transfer effectiveness do not provide a complete assessment of pollination value, but can serve as a general, inexpensive tool for pre-screening possible alternative pollinators.","Orchard crops; Pollen transfer; Pollination; Pollinator behaviour; Pollinator effectiveness",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034770579

If trophallaxis, food exchange among individuals of the same colony, serves to improve the coordination among nectar foragers, as occurs with the dance behavior, a high correlation might be expected between the foragers' trophallactic behavior and the profitability of the food sources they exploited. The aim of this work was to analyze whether a forager bee changes her trophallactic behavior with the varying profitability of a food source. In addition, since food source profitability affects dance behavior, we also analyzed the degree of coupling between the trophallactic and dance behavior of returning honeybees. Results show that trophallaxis by forager bees inside the hive changed rapidly with fluctuations in food source profitability. After an increase in profitability, returning foragers (1) increased the number of trophallactic offering contacts, (2) decreased the average duration of offering contacts, (3) shifted the temporal distribution of offering contacts from being mainly near the beginning of the time in the hive to being more evenly distributed throughout the entire visit, (4) begged for food less frequently, and (5) shifted their begging toward the very end of the visit. Regarding their dance behavior, foragers danced earlier in their visits to the hive and performed more waggle runs when the profitability of the food source was increased. Furthermore, the trophallactic and dance behaviors were affected not only by the absolute profitability of the food source but also by changes in profitability. Taken together, these results indicate that, in addition to dance behavior, short trophallactic interactions of returning foragers (which include both offering and begging contacts) may help foragers to communicate information about rapidly fluctuating resource opportunities.","Apis mellifera; Communication; Foraging; Honeybee",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034793969

The neural structures involved in the detection and integration of olfactory stimuli are represented bilaterally in the brain. Little is known about the respective roles of the two sides of the brain in olfactory learning. Does each side team independently of the other, or do they communicate, and if so, to what extent and at what level of neural integration? We addressed these questions using the proboscis extension response (PER) conditioning paradigm applied in a preparation that allows the separation of the two input sides during olfactory stimulations. Bees conditioned to two odorants A and B, one being learned on each side (A+/B+ training), showed in extinction tests rather unspecific responses: They responded to both odorants on both sides. This could be attributable to either a transfer of the teamed information between sides, or to a generalization between odorants on each side. By subjecting bees to conditioning on one side only (A+/0 training), we found that the teamed information is indeed transferred between sides. However, when bees were trained explicitly to give opposite values to the two odorants on the two sides (A+B-/B+A- training), they showed clear side-specific response patterns to these odorants.

As a first step in understanding this threat, we used hand pollination to investigate the effects of pollen from an invasive species (Lythrum salicaria) on seed set in a sympatric and co-flowering native congener (L. alatum). Dispersal of fluorescent dyes in the field confirms that pollinators (bumble bees and honey bees) transfer pollen between species. To determine the potential effect of such interspecific pollen transfer on seed set of the native, we pollinated 773 flowers on 20 plants with one of three treatments: legitimate conspecific pollen, a mixture of conspecific and foreign pollen, and foreign pollen. The mixed-pollen treatment resulted in 28.8% lower seed set relative to conspecific pollination. Foreign crosses resulted in extremely low seed set. Observations of pollen germination indicate that events at the stigmatic surface contribute to the reduction in seed set for mixed pollination.

In addition, the general toxic potency of the rainwater samples was evaluated in a microtiter luminescence assay with Vibrio fischeri bacteria. Rainwater samples were collected over four consecutive 14-day periods in both open and wet-only samplers. The esterase inhibiting potency of the open rainwater samples (expressed as ng dichlorvos-equivalents/l) corresponded well with the chemical analyses of the rainwater samples collected by both types of samplers (r=0.834-0.86). By far, the highest esterase inhibiting potency was found in a sample collected in an area with intense horticultural activities in June, and was attributed to high concentrations of dichlorvos, mevinphos, pirimiphos-methyl and methiocarb. The esterase inhibiting potency of this sample was equivalent to a dichlorvos concentration of 1380 ng/l in the rainwater, which is almost 2000 times higher than the maximum permissible concentration (MPC) of dichlorvos set for surface water in Netherlands. Maximum individual concentrations of dichlorvos and pirimiphos-methyl even exceeded the EC50 for Daphnia, suggesting that pesticides in rainwater pose a risk for aquatic organisms. Not all responses of the luminescence-assay for general toxicity could be explained by the analyzed pesticide concentrations.

The number of viable offspring produced during a reproductive cycle, per mite, was only 0.5 during winter compared with 1.0 during the summer. This was mainly due to a large increase in the population of non-reproductive mites (winter 20%, summer 8%). This increase can be explained by the high level of male offspring mortality observed in winter (42% vs. 18% in summer), which results in nearly half of the newly reared female mites being unfertilised. Since mites that do reproduce lay a similar number of eggs in winter (X̄ = 4.7) as in summer (X̄ = 4.9), and the level of mortality suffered by the first female offspring is similar in winter (7%) as in summer (6%), it is probably not the internal physiological state of the host which causes the high level of winter non-reproduction, as has been previously suspected.","Mortality; Reproduction; Varroa; Winter",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034812747

Over two seasons Dillwynia juniperina was not pollen-limited indicating that flowers were saturated with pollen and that adequate bee servicing was occurring. Two native bee species (Leioproctus sp. l and Lasioglossum sp.) and the introduced honeybee, Apis melhfera L., were the most common visitors to flowers. Bee abundance varied between sites with honeybees being more common than native bees at one site. Native bees were never the most dominant pollinator. Visitation data show that native bees spend more time at flowers than introduced bees, although on average honeybees visit slightly more flowers on a bush than do native bees. Visitation data also revealed that native bee presence at bushes is negatively correlated with the presence of honeybees at the same bushes. At one of the study sites, honeybees were very abundant, but very few native bees were ever recorded over the 3 years. Results show that flowers can be pollinated from a single visit by a honeybee or native bee.

A striking property of MLT is that its ability to permeabilize zwitterionic phospholipid vesicles is dramatically reduced upon the addition of anionic lipids. Because the mechanism of permeabilization may be fundamentally different for the two types of lipids, we examined MLT-induced release of entrapped fluorescent dextran markers of two different molecular masses (4 and 50 kDa) from anionic palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol (POPG) vesicles. Unlike release from palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) vesicles, which is highly selective for the 4 kDa marker, implying release through pores of about 25 Å diameter [Ladokhin et al., Biophys. J. 72 (1997) 1762], release from POPG vesicles was found to be non-selective, i.e., 'detergent-like'. Oriented circular dichroism measurements of MLT in oriented POPG and POPC multilayers disclosed that α-helical MLT can be induced to adopt a transbilayer orientation in POPC multilayers, but not in POPG multilayers. The apparent inhibition of MLT permeabilization by anionic membranes may thus be due to suppression of translocation ability. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

We determined whether the JH increase occurs in anticipation of foraging or whether it is a result of actual foraging experience and/or diurnal changes in exposure to sunlight. We recorded all foraging flights of tagged bees observed at a feeder in a large outdoor flight cage. We measured JH from bees that had taken 1, 3-5, or > 100 foraging flights and foragers of indeterminate experience leaving or entering the hive. To study diurnal variation in JH, we sampled foragers every 6 h over one day. Titers of JH in foragers were high relative to nurses as in previous studies, suggesting that conditions in the flight cage had no effect on the relationship between foraging behavior and JH. Titers of JH in foragers showed no significant effects of foraging experience, but did show significant diurnal variation.

Dopamine and two possible metabolites of dopamine, N-acetyldopamine (NADA) and norepinephrine were detected in brain extracts. The brain levels of dopamine, NADA and norepinephrine were positively correlated with ovary development. Individuals with high dopamine levels had high levels of NADA or norepinephrine, suggesting that these metabolites might be involved in the change of reproductive sates of workers. Dopamine was distributed mainly in the protocerebrum, whereas NADA was in both the optic lobes and the protocerebrum. Dopamine levels in each distinct brain regions were higher in queenless workers than in normal workers, whereas there was a higher NADA level in the optic lobes in queenless workers than in normal workers. These results suggest that dopamine might be stored and/or released around the protocerebrum and the deutocerebrum, and also diffuse to the optic lobes where dopamine secretory cells are absent, resulting in high NADA levels in the optic lobes.

Retention is monitored at two long-term intervals corresponding to early (1 and 2 d after conditioning) and late long-term memory (3 and 4 d). The acquisition level is varied by using different conditioned stimuli (odors, mechanical stimulation, and temperature increase at the antenna), varying strengths of the unconditioned stimulus (sucrose), and various numbers of conditioning trials. How learning trials are spaced is the dominant factor both for acquisition and retention, and although longer intertrial intervals lead to better acquisition and higher retention, the level of acquisition per se does not determine the spacing effect on retention. Rather, spaced conditioning leads to higher memory consolidation both during acquisition and later, between the early and long-term memory phases.

We tested the hypothesis that eicosanoids also mediate nodulation reactions to bacterial challenge in adults of a social insect, the honey bee, Apis mellifera. Treating newly-emerged experimental bees with the eicosanoid biosynthesis inhibitor, dexamethasone, impaired nodulation reactions to bacterial infections, and the influence of dexamethasone was reversed by treating infected insects with arachidonic acid, an eicosanoid precursor. Several other eicosanoid biosynthesis inhibitors, including the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, and the dual cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitor, phenidone, also impaired the ability of experimental honeybees to form nodules in reaction to bacterial challenge. The influence of phenidone on nodulation was expressed in a dose-dependent manner. However, in experiments with older honey bees foragers, similar bacterial challenge did not evoke nodulation reactions. We infer from our results that while eicosanoids mediate cellular immune responses to bacterial infections in newly emerged honey bees, and more broadly, in most insect species, nodulation reactions to bacterial challenge probably do not occur in all phases of insect life cycles. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Electroantennogram recordings confirmed that hygienic bees exhibit increased olfactory sensitivity to low concentrations of the odor of chalkbrood infected pupae (a fungal disease caused by Ascosphaera apis). Three-week-old hygienic bees were able to discriminate between the brood odors significantly better than three-week old non-hygienic bees. However, the differential performance in brood odor discrimination was primarily genetically based, not a direct result of age, experience, or the temporary behavioral state of the bee. Lower stimulus thresholds for both the olfactory and behavioral responses of hygienic bees may facilitate their ability to detect, uncap and remove diseased brood rapidly from the nest. In contrast, non-hygienic bees, possessing higher response thresholds, may not be able to detect diseased brood as easily. Our results provide an example of how physiological and behavioral differences between the hygienic and non-hygienic honey bee lines, operating at the level of the individual, could produce colony-specific behavioral phenotypes.","Apis mellifera; Electroantennogram; Hygienic behavior; Proboscis-extension reflex; Response thresholds",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034860387

Biogenic amines control and regulate various vital functions including circadian rhythms, endocrine secretion, cardiovascular control, emotions, as well as learning and memory. In insects, amines like dopamine, tyramine, octopamine, serotonin, and histamine exert their effects by binding to specific membrane proteins that primarily belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors.

The impact of the mite Varroa jacobsoni is related to the climatic conditions and the races of Apis mellifera bees in each region where the pest exists. In the present study, the mite infestation levels were assessed to determine the evolution of the pest in Africanized bee colonies in Southern Brazil. The current level of infestation was considered low, approximately two mites per one hundred adult bees. This result is similar to that obtained for the same apiary almost five years ago and for others distributed in various regions of Brazil. In the present study, on average, 61% of the total varroa population was found in the worker brood.","Africanized Bees; Honey Bees; Infestation; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042194858

The antibacterial activity was studied for 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25% of bees honey in nutrient agar and the inhibitory grade was ranked from O to 5. The selected bacterial strains for this study were Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Listeria spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Storage in darkness or sunlight for four months, as well as mild heat treatment (40°C for 30 days) did not affect the antibacterial properties. Antibacterial activity was higher in scraped honey, but it was more vulnerable to heat treatment than centrifuged honey. Exposures of scraped honeys at 78°C for 15 minutes significantly decreased the antibacterial activity, with partial losses of 67,4% for E. coli and 54% for S. aureus. Listeria spp. was the most sensitive bacteria. E. coli was the most resistant bacteria for heated honey and B. subtilis the most resistant for fresh honey.","Antibacterial activity; Heat treatment; Honey; Storage",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345979675

Additional focal injections were carried out with cobalt hexamine chloride and dextran fluorescent markers. Olfactory interneurons (projection neurons, PNs) project by means of five tracts, the lateral, the median, and three mediolateral antennocerebral tracts (l-, m-, and ml-ACT, respectively) to the mushroom bodies (MBs) and the protocerebral lobe (PL) of the ipsilateral protocerebrum. Uniglomerular PNs of the m- and l-ACT receiving input from a single glomerulus of the AL also arborize in different regions of the AL. The vast majority of l-ACT innervate the T1 region, whereas m-ACT neurons arborize exclusively in the T2, T3, and T4 regions (T1-4: AL projection area of sensory cells from the antennae). In the calyces of the MB, uniglomerular PNs form varicosities in the basal ring and the lip region. Individual neurons of both types exhibit unequal innervation within and between the two calyces. In addition, m-ACT fibers ramify more densely within the lip neuropil and show a higher incidence of spine-like processes than l-ACTs. In the PL, l-ACTs arborize exclusively within the lateral horn, whereas some m-ACT neurons innervate a broader region. Multiglomerular neurons of the ml-ACT leave the AL by means of three subtracts (ml-ACT 1-3). Two different types can be distinguished according to their protocerebral target areas: ml-ACTs projecting to the lateral PL (LPL) and to the neuropil around the α-lobe (tracts 2 and 3) and neurons projecting only to the LPL (tract 1). Intracellular recordings indicate that both l- and m-ACT neurons respond to general odors but with different response properties, indicating that odor information is processed in parallel pathways with different functional characteristics. Just like m-ACT neurons, ml-ACT neurons respond to odors with complex activity patterns. Bilateral interneurons, originating in the suboesophageal ganglion, connect glomeruli of both AL, and send an axon through the m-ACT in each hemisphere of the brain, terminating in the lip region of the calyces. These neurons respond to contact chemical stimuli. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Antennal lobe; Bilateral neurons; Fluorescent dextrans; Insects; Neuroanatomy; Neurobiotin; Projection neurons",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035959483

Mitochondrial DNA of African honeybees appears to be composed of three highly divergent lineages. The African lineage previously reported (named A) is Present in almost all the localities except those from north-eastern Africa. In this area, two newly described lineages (called O and Y), putatively originating from the Near East, are observed in high proportion. This suggests an important differentiation of Ethiopian and Egyptian honeybees from those of other African areas. The A lineage is also present in high proportion in populations from the Iberian Peninsula and Sicily. Furthermore, eight populations from Morocco, Guinea, Malawi and South Africa have been assayed with six microsatellite loci and compared to a set of eight additional populations from Europe and the Middle East. The African populations display higher genetic variability than European populations at all microsatellite loci studied thus far. This suggests that African populations have larger effective sizes than European ones. According to their microsatellite allele frequencies, the eight African populations cluster together, but are divided in two subgroups. These are the populations from Morocco and those from the other African countries. The populations from southern Europe show very low levels of 'Africanization' at nuclear microsatellite loci. Because nuclear and mitochondrial DNA often display discordant patterns of differentiation in the honeybee, the use of both kinds of markers is preferable when assessing the phylogeography of Apis mellifera and to determine the taxonomic status of the subspecies.","Africa; Apis mellifera; Microsatellite; mtDNA; Phylogeography; Population genetics",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034881921

In the centre of each landscape, a patch of Centaurea plants was established for standardized measurements of flower visitation, seed predation and seed set. Both the number of flower-visiting bees and the proportion of flower heads damaged by seed predators increased with landscape complexity, which was measured as the proportion of semi-natural habitats. The mean number of seeds per flower head did not increase with the proportion of semi-natural habitats, presumably because of the counterbalancing effects of pollination and seed predation. For a subset of undamaged flower heads, the number of seeds per flower head was positively correlated with the number of flower visits. Further reasons for the unexpected failure to detect a correlation between landscape complexity and seed set appeared to be changes in flower-visitor behaviour and the contrasting responses of honeybees and wild bees to habitat context. Landscape analyses at eight spatial scales (radius of landscape sectors, 250-3000 m) showed that different groups perceived the landscape at different spatial scales. Changes in pollinator numbers could be explained only at small scales (up to 1000 m), while the seed predators also responded to large scales (up to 2500 m).","Bees; Biotic interactions; Foraging behaviour; Habitat fragmentation; Landscape structure; Spatial scale",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035934295

However, conflict within a colony increases drastically during colony reproduction ('swarming') when newly produced queens fight each other until only one queen remains in the nest. This study describes the behavior of queens and workers during naturally occurring queen combat. The duels of five pairs of queens were observed in three observation colonies. A typical duel is described qualitatively and the events of all five duels are described quantitatively. Several aspects of duels that are of particular interest are examined in detail, including the behavior of queens near capped queen cells, worker aggression toward queens, queen tooting, and the relation of queen and worker behavior to the outcome of the duel. The results of this investigation serve as a foundation for rigorous tests of hypotheses regarding the adaptive significance of queen and worker behavior during queen combat. The results presented suggest that: young queens patrol queen cells to kill rival queens while they are vulnerable; workers aggress queens to prevent them from destroying queen cells; queens toot to inhibit worker aggression; workers immobilize queens to make them easy targets for rival queens; and queens eject hind-gut contents to cause their rival to be immobilized by the workers.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034905183

After this time, it becomes a forager, flying repeatedly to collect food outside of the hive for the remainder of its 5-6 week life. Previous studies have shown that foragers have an increased volume of neuropil associated with the mushroom bodies, a brain region involved in learning, memory, and sensory integration. We report here that growth of the mushroom body neuropil in adult bees occurs throughout adult life and continues after bees begin to forage. Studies using Golgi impregnation asked whether the growth of the collar region of the mushroom body neuropil was a result of growth of the dendritic processes of the mushroom body intrinsic neurons, the Kenyon cells. Branching and length of dendrites in the collar region of the calyces were strongly correlated with worker age, but when age-matched bees were directly compared, those with foraging experience had longer, more branched dendrites than bees that had foraged less or not at all. The density of Kenyon cell dendritic spines remained constant regardless of age or behavioral state. Older and more experienced foragers therefore have a greater total number of dendritic spines in the mushroom body neuropil. Our findings indicate that, under natural conditions, the cytoarchitectural complexity of neurons in the mushroom bodies of adult honeybees increases as a function of increasing age, but that foraging experience promotes additional dendritic branching and growth.","Apis mellifera; Dendritic branching; Foraging; Golgi impregnation; Kenyon cells; Spine density",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035882527

The endocannabinoid system also appears to be phylogenetically ancient - it occurs in mammals, birds, amphibians, fish, sea urchins, leeches, mussels, and even the most primitive animal with a nerve network, the Hydra. The presence of CB receptors, however, has not been examined in terrestrial invertebrates (or any member of the Ecdysozoa). Surprisingly, we found no specific binding of the synthetic CB ligands [3H]CP55,940 and [3H]SR141716A in a panel of insects: Apis mellifera, Drosophila melanogaster, Gerris marginatus, Spodoptera frugiperda, and Zophobas atratus. A lack of functional CB receptors was confirmed by the inability of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and HU210 to activate G-proteins in insect tissues, utilizing a guanosine-5′-O-(3-[35]thio)-triphosphate (GTPγS) assay. No orthologs of human CB receptors were located in the Drosophila genome, nor did we find orthologs of fatty acid amide hydrolase. This loss of CB receptors appears to be unique in the field of comparative neurobiology. No other known mammalian neuroreceptor is understood to be missing in insects. We hypothesized that CB receptors were lost in insects because of a dearth of ligands; endogenous CB ligands are metabolites of arachidonic acid, and insects produce little or no arachidonic acid or endocannabinoid ligands, such as anandamide. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Anandamide; Cannabinoid receptors; Cannabis; Fatty acid amide hydrolase; GTPγs; Insects; Neurotransmitters; Sequencing analysis; Tetrahydrocannabinol",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035817421

Significant differences in the distribution of alleles were found in both data sets, confirming the genetic differentiation among some of the islands but not within them. Two mitochondrial haplotypes characteristic of the Canary Islands are found at high frequencies, although populations are introgressed by imported honeybees of eastern European C lineage. This introgression is rather high on Tenerife and El Hierro and low on Gran Canaria and La Gomera, whereas on La Palma it has not been recorded. The finding of microsatellite alleles characteristic of the eastern European lineage corroborates the genetic introgression.

Foragers showed circadian rhythm under conditions of constant light and constant dark with free-running periods of more and less than 24 hr, respectively. These observations indicated that A. cerana possesses a circadian clock controlling locomotor activity. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the circadian system we cloned cDNA for a homolog of the clock gene period (per) from the honeybee by a PCR-strategy. The cloned per-cDNAs consisted of two types, α and β, encoding a putative protein of 1124 amino acids and 1116 amino acids, respectively. The sequences of types α and β were identical except that the former possessed an additional 24 bp stretch corresponding to 8 amino acids in the conserved C2 block. These two types were assumed to be differentially spliced variants and found also in per cDNA of A. mellifera. In support of this idea, Southern blotting experiments showed that per of A. cerana is a single copy gene. RT-PCR analysis and subcloning of the products revealed that the both types α and β are expressed in the brain of the forager. A quantitative RT-PCR assay by which the level of per mRNA in one single brain can be detected was established.

At 54-56 days after inoculation, parasite spores in the workers' midguts were counted to determine whether there was a greater variation of infection intensity (spore counts per worker) in high-diversity colonies than in low-diversity ones. In all colonies there were two discrete sets of workers, with few or many parasite spores. To compare the variations of infection intensity between two colony groups, coefficients of variation were calculated for all workers examined, and for the slightly infected and strongly infected workers. The percentages of slightly infected workers in the low- and high-diversity groups were also compared.

Workers often join neighboring colonies by drifting, but long-range drifting (dispersal) to colonies far away from the maternal nests also rarely occurs. We tested the impact of queenstate and taxon of mother and host colonies on drifting and dispersing of workers and on the hosting of these workers in A. m. capensis, A. m. scutellata, and their natural hybrids. Workers were paint-marked according to colony and reintroduced into their queenright or queenless mother colonies. After 10 days, 579 out of 12,034 labeled workers were recaptured in foreign colonies. We found that drifting and dispersing represent different behaviors, which were differently affected by taxon and queenstate of both mother and host colonies. Hybrid workers drifted more often than A. m. capensis and A. m. scutellata. However, A. m. capensis workers dispersed more often than A. m. scutellata and the hybrids combined, and A. m. scutellata workers also dispersed more frequently than the hybrids. Dispersers from queenright A. m. capensis colonies were more often found in queenless host colonies and vice versa, indicating active host searching and/or a queenstate-discriminating guarding mechanism. Our data show that A. m. capensis workers disperse significantly more often than other races of A. mellifera, suggesting that dispersing represents a host finding mechanism. The lack of dispersal in hybrids and different hosting mechanisms of foreign workers by hybrid colonies may also be responsible for the stability of the natural hybrid zone between A. m. capensis and A. m. scutellata.","Apis mellifera capensis; Apis mellifera scutellata; Honeybee; Host finding; Hybrids; Social parasitism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034946382

Results indicated that the 48-h oral LD50 of imidacloprid is between 41 and &gt;81 ng per bee, and the contact LD50 between 49 and 102 ng per bee. The ingested amount of imidacloprid-containing sucrose solution decreased with increasing imidacloprid concentrations and may be attributed to dose-related sub-lethal intoxication symptoms or to antifeedant responses. Some previously reported imidacloprid metabolites occurring at low levels in planta after seed dressing, ie olefine-, 5-OH- and 4,5-OH-imidacloprid, showed lower oral LD50 values (&gt;36, &gt;49 and 159ng per bee, respectively) compared with the concurrently tested parent molecule (41ng per bee).

We carried out weekly assays of worker removal of experimentally transferred eggs, dissection and inspection of worker bee ovaries, and daily checks of worker oviposition. Following queen removal, the egg-removal rate by workers generally first increased then decreased or levelled off over the four-week time course of the experiment; this behaviour was closely synchronized with the increase in worker ovary development and egg-laying.

We measured bees' perception by determining what concentration of sucrose touched to the antennae elicited the proboscis extension response (response threshold). A low response threshold (extension at low concentration) suggests a high perceptual value of sucrose, and vice versa. Perception of sucrose solutions differed between two artificially selected genotypic strains and was modulated by the bees' recent feeding experiences. Bees offered 10%, 30%, or 50% sucrose solutions in small cages overnight, and in large flight-cages or free-flying in the field for several days, had subsequent response thresholds positively correlated to the concentration offered. Empty bees, whether they were nectar, water or pollen foragers, dancers or non-dancers, had a significantly lower threshold than loaded bees. Crop volume affected response thresholds directly and independently of sucrose concentration. We interpret these findings as multiple mechanisms that operate in different time scales, modulating perception of sucrose. Changes occurred in the time scale of evolutionary processes as demonstrated by genotypic differences.

The mechanism of the anti-tumor promotion activity of CAPE is unclear, however. In this study, we found that CAPE suppressed 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13acetate-induced cell transformation and induced apoptosis in mouse epidermal JB6 Cl 41 cells. No difference in induction of apoptosis was observed between normal lymphoblasts and sphingomyelinase-deficient cell lines. Although CAPE treatment of two p53 mutant tumor cell lines, NCl-H358 and SK-OV-3, and p53-deficient (p53-/-) cells caused the cleavage of caspase-3 as well as DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 cleavage was seen early (at 6 h) only in cells expressing wild-type p53 (p53+/+) and Cl 41 cells. These results suggested that p53 may be involved in the early stage of CAPE-induced apoptosis. The p53-dependent transcription activation occurred 2 h after treatment with CAPE and reached a maximum at 6 h in Cl 41 p53 DNA-binding sequence stable transfectant cells. In addition, phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 and serine 392 was induced in Cl 41 cells within 6 h after treatment with CAPE.

A number of studies, now considered classics, established that bees could be trained to collect food at virtually any time of the circadian cycle and that this timekeeping ability was controlled by an endogenous circadian clock. Recently, behavioral rhythms in bees have been examined using a variety of approaches, in both laboratory and field studies. The following areas of new research are reviewed: (a) the ontogeny of behavioral rhythmicity in newly emerged worker bees; (b) the integration of behavioral rhythmicity with the colony's division of labor; (c) the evidence for social entrainment of behavioral rhythms and for a 'clock of the colony'; (d) the potential linkage between circadian rhythms of general locomotor activity and the foraging time-sense; (e) learning and entrainment hypotheses proposed to explain the mechanism underlying the time-sense; (f) the interplay between extinction and persistence of the time-memory as revealed from the differential behavior of individuals within the foraging group; and (g) comparisons of the Zeitgedächtnis with food-anticipatory rhythms in other animals. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Behavior; Circadian rhythms; Foraging; Honey bee; Locomotor activity",Short Survey,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035879541

The main factors affecting the SPME process, such as the absorption time profile, salt, and temperature, were optimized. The method involved honeybee sample homogenization, elution with an acetone:water solution (1:1) and dilution in water prior to fiber extraction. Moreover, the matrix effect on the extraction was evaluated. In samples spiked at the 0.2 mg kg-1 level, the coefficient variation was between 1 and 13% and the detection limits were below 10 μg kg-1.

The total amount of the six components increased with age. The relative quantities in the mandibular gland secretion of queenless caged workers were found to change rapidly during the first 4 days after emergence and to become dominated by the queen substance, 9-keto-2(E)-decenoic acid. Also the relative amounts of 9-hydroxy-decenoic acid, a precursor of the queen substance, showed an increase of an order of magnitude within the first 4 days of imaginal life. The relative amounts of the aromatic compounds typical to the queen pheromone remained similar in this developmental time window. The increase of queenlike compounds is particularly strong between days two and three after emergence.

The enzyme preparation was confirmed to be a monomeric protein and a glycoprotein containing about 7.4% of carbohydrate.

The enzyme was characterized by the ability to rapidly hydrolyze sucrose, phenyl α-glucoside, maltose, and maltotriose, and by extremely high Km for substrates, compared with those of α-glucosidases I and II. Especially, maltotriose was hydrolyzed over 3 times as rapidly as maltose. However, maltooligosaccharides of four or more in the degree of polymerization were slowly degraded. The relative rates of the k0 values for maltose, sucrose, p-nitrophenyl α-glucoside and maltotriose were estimated to be 100, 527, 281 and 364, and the Km values for these substrates, 11, 30, 13, and 10 mM, respectively.

These samples were used to provide baseline information for a detailed analysis of the process of Africanization of bees from the neotropical Yucatan peninsula of Mexico. Radical changes in mitochondrial haplotype (mitotype) frequencies were found to have occurred in the 13-year period studied. Prior to the arrival of Africanized bees (1986) the original inhabitants of the Yucatan peninsula appear to have been essentially of southeastern European origin with a smaller proportion having northwestern European ancestry. Three years after the migration of Africanized bees into the area (1989), only very low levels of maternal gene flow from Africanized populations into the resident European populations had occurred. By 1998, however, there was a sizeable increase in the proportion of African mitotypes in domestic populations (61%) with feral populations having 87% of mitotypes classified as African derived. The results suggest that the early stages of Africanization did not involve a rapid replacement of European with African mitotypes and that earlier studies probably overestimated the prevalence of African mitotypes.","Africanized bee; Apis mellifera; Gene flow; Honeybee; Hybridization; Mitochondrial RFLP",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034983664

The free fatty acid content of the midgut was used to quantify fat digestion. Midguts extracted from younger workers of known ages and from foragers were divided into three components: endoperitrophic region (peritrophic membrane with gut contents), extraperitrophic region and intestinal wall. Both the total amount of pollen and the amount of free fatty acids in the endoperitrophic region and in the intestinal wall depend on the bee's age. The amounts increase within the 1st 3 days of a honey bee's life, reach maxima around the age of 8 days and then decrease continuously to the lowest values, measured in forager bees. Forced feeding with triacylglycerol results in significantly higher levels of free fatty acids, especially in the endoperitrophic region, in 8-day-old bees and foragers. This indicates that lipolytic activity depends on age and that the free fatty acid content in 8-day-old bees is primarily limited by the amount and availability of lipids ingested. The results show further that fat digestion depends on the functional status of honey bees, as is the case for pollen consumption, speed of transport of pollen bolus through the alimentary canal and protein digestion.","Age; Honey bee; Lipids; Nutrition; Pollen",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034996868

When foragers collect food in a short, narrow tunnel, they dance as if the food source were much farther away. Dancers gauge distance by retinal image flow on the way to their destination. Their visually driven odometer misreads distance because the close tunnel walls increase optic flow. We examined how hive mates interpret these dances. Here we show that recruited bees search outside in the direction of the tunnel at exaggerated distances and not inside the tunnel where the foragers come from. Thus, dances must convey information about the direction of the food source and the total amount of image motion en route to the food source, but they do not convey information about absolute distances. We also found that perceived distances on various outdoor routes from the same hive could be considerably different. Navigational errors are avoided as recruits and dancers tend to fly in the same direction.

Here we investigate its movement in Asian weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) and honeybees (Apis mellifera). When ants run upside down on a smooth surface, the arolium is unfolded and folded back with each step. Its extension is strictly coupled with the retraction of the claws. Experimental pull on the claw-flexor tendon revealed that the claw-flexor muscle not only retracts the claws, but also moves the arolium. The elicited arolium movement comprises (i) about a 90° rotation (extension) mediated by the interaction of the two rigid pretarsal sclerites arcus and manubrium and (ii) a lateral expansion and increase in volume. In severed legs of O. smaragdina ants, an increase in hemolymph pressure of 15 kPa was sufficient to inflate the arolium to its full size. Apart from being actively extended, an arolium in contact also can unfold passively when the leg is subject to a pull toward the body. We propose a combined mechanical-hydraulic model for arolium movement: (i) the arolium is engaged by the action of the unguitractor, which mechanically extends the arolium; (ii) compression of the arolium gland reservoir pumps liquid into the arolium; (iii) arolia partly in contact with the surface are unfolded passively when the legs are pulled toward the body; and (iv) the arolium deflates and moves back to its default position by elastic recoil of the cuticle.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035933062

In this study we employed a differential-display reverse transcription (DDRT)-PCR protocol to detect ecdysteroid-regulated gene expression during a critical phase of caste development. We identified a Ftz-F1 homolog and a Cut-like transcript. Ftz-F1 could be a putative element of the metamorphic ecdysone response cascade of bees, whereas Cut-like proteins are described as transcription factors involved in maintaining cellular differentiation states.

Rows of sterile male parent which were in proximity (up to 5th row) to the male parent gave higher total hybrid seed yield/capitulum due to greater flow of pollens (r = 0.94) - as a result of higher bee abundance and increased PEI (r = 0.93).

Genetic polymorphisms of flowering plants can influence pollinator foraging but it is not known whether heritable foraging polymorphisms of pollinators influence their pollination efficacies. Honey bees Apis mellifera L. visit cranberry flowers for nectar but rarely for pollen when alternative preferred flowers grow nearby. 2. Cranberry flowers visited once by pollen-foraging honey bees received four-fold more stigmatic pollen than flowers visited by mere nectar-foragers (excluding nectar thieves). Manual greenhouse pollinations with fixed numbers of pollen tetrads (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32) achieved maximal fruit set with just eight pollen tetrads. Pollen-foraging honey bees yielded a calculated 63% more berries than equal numbers of non-thieving nectar-foragers, even though both classes of forager made stigmatic contact. 3. Colonies headed by queens of a pollen-hoarding genotype fielded significantly more pollen-foraging trips than standard commercial genotypes, as did hives fitted with permanently engaged pollen traps or colonies containing more larvae. Pollen-hoarding colonies together brought back twice as many cranberry pollen loads as control colonies, which was marginally significant despite marked daily variation in the proportion of collected pollen that was cranberry. 4. Caloric supplementation of matched, paired colonies failed to enhance pollen foraging despite the meagre nectar yields of individual cranberry flowers. 5. Heritable behavioural polymorphisms of the honey bee, such as pollen-hoarding, can enhance fruit and seed set by a floral host (e.g. cranberry), but only if more preferred pollen hosts are absent or rare. Otherwise, honey bees' broad polylecty, flight range, and daily idiosyncrasies in floral fidelity will obscure specific pollen-foraging differences at a given floral host, even among paired colonies in a seemingly uniform agricultural setting.","Apis; Apoidea; Bees; Behavioural genetics; Cranberry; Foraging; Pollination efficiency; Pollinator; Vaccinium",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035037162

Females of the European beewolf Philanthus triangulum (Hymenoptera, Sphecidae) provision brood cells with paralysed honeybees as larval food. Because brood cells are located in warm, humid locations there is a high risk of microbial decomposition of the provisions. Low incidence of fungus infestation (Aspergillus sp.) in nests in the field suggested the presence of an anti-fungal adaptation. 2. To test whether the paralysis caused the protection from fungus infestation, the timing of fungus growth on bees that were freeze-killed, paralysed but not provisioned, and provisioned regularly by beewolf females was determined. Fungus growth was first detected on freeze-killed bees, followed by paralysed but not provisioned bees. By contrast, fungus growth on provisioned bees was delayed greatly or even absent. Thus, paralysis alone is much less efficient in delaying fungus growth than is regular provisioning. 3. Observations of beewolves in their nests revealed that females lick the body surface of their prey very thoroughly during the period of excavation of the brood cell. 4. To separate the effect of a possible anti-fungal property of the brood cell and the licking of the bees, a second experiment was conducted. Timing of fungus growth on paralysed bees did not differ between artificial and original brood cells. By contrast, fungus growth on bees that had been provisioned by a female but were transferred to artificial brood cells was delayed significantly. Thus, the treatment of the bees by the female wasp but not the brood cell caused the delay in fungus growth. 5. Beewolf females most probably apply anti-fungal chemicals to the cuticle of their prey. This is the first demonstration of the mechanism involved in the preservation of provisions in a hunting wasp. Some kind of preservation of prey as a component of parental care is probably widespread among hunting wasps and might have been a prerequisite for the evolution of mass provisioning.","Aspergillus; Chemical preservation; Fungus infestation; Hymenoptera; Parental care; Philanthus triangulum F.; Sphecidae",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035027911

(Acarina: Varroidae), is the most serious parasite of honey bees, Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in the U.S. Varroa immatures and adults feed on bee hemolymph, causing morphological abnormalities and transmitting debilitating viruses. Without control efforts by man, varroa eventually destroy the colony within ca. 2 years. Application of smoke from burning of grapefruit leaves over varroa-infested honey bees has been shown to cause biological activity on the varroa: after exposure, varroa detach and fall from their honey bee hosts. Such detachment of varroa and falling to the hive floor during cooler weather could provide substantial control of the varroa, since many varroa are unable to crawl back to the cluster of bees. We investigated the compounds involved in producing this biological activity by grapefruit leaves. Extracts were made of whole leaves, smoke collections, and residue from the burning chamber. Bioassay of these extracts indicated that the residue from the burning chamber contained the compounds most active in varroa detachment. Analysis of this residue by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed a number of compound classes, particularly phenolic compounds. Bioassay of these individual compounds showed that the phenolic 3-methylphenol was most active in causing varroa to detach from bees in the laboratory in both indirect and direct exposure bioassays. Discussion is given on the role of other phenolic compounds in the control of arthropod pests.","Apis mellifera; Control; Extracts; Grapefruit; Honey bees; Integrated Pest Management; Natural compounds; Phenolics; Varroa; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035607768

The variation of the ratio of reinforced to nonreinforced stimuli modulated the amount of differentiation.

The honeybee Apis mellifera constitutes a traditional model for studying learning and memory at behavioural, cellular and molecular levels. Earlier studies focused on elementary associative and non-associative forms of learning determined by either olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex or the learning of visual stimuli in an operant context. However, research has indicated that bees are capable of cognitive performances that were thought to occur only in some vertebrate species. For example, honeybees can interpolate visual information, exhibit associative recall, categorize visual information and learn contextual information. Here we show that honeybees can form 'sameness' and 'difference' concepts. They learn to solve 'delayed matching-to-sample' tasks, in which they are required to respond to a matching stimulus, and 'delayed non-matching-to-sample' tasks, in which they are required to respond to a different stimulus; they can also transfer the learned rules to new stimuli of the same or a different sensory modality. Thus, not only can bees learn specific objects and their physical parameters, but they can also master abstract inter-relationships, such as sameness and difference.",,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035912192

Workers typically live 3-6weeks during the spring and summer and can live about 4months during the winter. Queens are longer lived. Anecdotes of queens living 2-3years are not unusual, though they normally live less than a year in commercial hives. Little is known about the life span of drones.Queens develop from fertilized eggs that are not different from the eggs that develop into workers. Queens are, however, twice as large, have specialized anatomy, live much longer, and develop faster from egg to adult. All of these differences are derived from differences in larval rearing environment, primarily nutrition. The developmental trajectory of a female larva from worker into a queen can be determined as late as the third day of larval development, after this time the developmental pathway is fixed for a worker phenotype. The total time of larval development is only 5-6days, therefore, just 2-3days of differential feeding can lead to profound differences in development, and longevity.Workers undergo age development after they become adults. Workers usually initiate foraging behavior when they are 2-3weeks old. The age at which a worker initiates foraging is a strong determinant of her length of life. This is presumed to be a result of the hazards of foraging, but natural senescence also occurs. Some bees remain in the nest and are never observed to forage, thereby outliving their forager sisters. Corresponding to this behavioral development are changes in the sizes of glands and the production of glandular products, increases in biogenic amine titers within the brain, an increase in the volume of specific regions of the brain, and changes in the neural system that affect perception of stimuli, and learning and memory. These age-related changes in behavior are regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Genetic variation has been demonstrated for many of these life history and behavioral traits. Selection and genome mapping studies have demonstrated relationships between the neural system, behavior, and life history traits.

Morphologically, these subsystems are characterized by a large number of receptor neurons sensitive to components of the female's pheromones and hypertrophied glomerular subunits ('macroglomeruli' or 'macroglomerular complexes') in the antennal lobes, in which the axons of the receptor neurons converge. The olfactory subsystems are adapted for an increased sensitivity to perceive minute amounts of pheromones. In Apis mellifera, drones have 18,600 olfactory poreplate sensilla per antenna, each equipped with receptor neurons sensitive to the queen's sex pheromone, and four voluminous macroglomeruli (MG1-MG4) in the antennal lobes. In contrast, we show that drones of the phylogenetically distant species, Apis florea, have only 1,200 poreplate sensilla per antenna and only two macroglomeruli in their antennal lobes. These macroglomeruli are homologous in anatomical position to the two most prominent macroglomeruli in A. mellifera, the MG1 and MG2, but they are much smaller in size. The morphological and anatomical differences described here suggest major modifications in the sex-pheromone processing subsystem of both species: (1) less pheromone sensitivity in A. florea and (2) a more complex sex-pheromone processing and thus a more complex sex-pheromone communication in A. mellifera. Research in honey bee sex-pheromone communication dates back to the 1960s, when Gary (1962) demonstrated that in Apis mellifera the queen's mandibular gland secretion and especially its main component, 9-ODA (9-keto-2(E)-decenoic acid), is highly attractive to drones on their nuptial flight. Later, cross-species attraction experiments showed that other honey bee species, Apis florea, A. cerana, and A. dorsata probably also use the queen's mandibular gland secretion as a mating attractant (Butler et al. 1967; Sanasi et al. 1971). Besides its function in mating behavior, the queen's mandibular gland secretion is the main pheromone regulating queen - worker interactions (Free 1987). In this context, several studies have demonstrated the behavioral significance of single components (Slessor et al. 1988) and differences in the composition of the secretion between Apis species (Plettner et al. 1996, 1997; Keeling et al. 2000). Regarding the interspecific differences in the queen's signal, the question arises whether this variation is reflected in the olfactory system of drones and workers of the various species.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035061306

Foragers typically transfer a nectar load in the nest as sub-loads to several receivers rather than as a single transfer. Foragers experience delays in finding receivers and use these delays to balance the number of foragers and receivers. A short delay results in the forager-recruiting waggle dance whereas a long delay results in the receiver-recruiting tremble dance. Several nectar transfers increase the cost of this system by introducing additional delays in finding extra receivers. We tested four hypotheses to explain the occurrence of multiple transfer. We found no evidence that multiple transfer is due to different crop capacities of foragers and receivers or that it results from extensive trophallactic interactions with nest-mates. Receiver bees frequently evaporate nectar in their mouthparts to hasten the production of honey. The suggestion has been made that multiple transfer is driven by receivers who take partial loads from foragers to enhance nectar evaporation. An alternative suggestion is that foragers drive multiple transfer to gain better information on the balance of foragers and receivers. Multiple sampling of the delay in finding a receiver reduces the standard deviation of the delay mean and so provides foragers with better information than is provided by a single delay. The enhanced-evaporation hypothesis predicts that receivers break foragers' first transfer whereas the information improvement hypothesis predicts foragers break their first transfers. Furthermore, only the information improvement hypothesis predicts a high level of multiple receptions. Data on transfer break-off and receiver behaviour strongly support the information improvement hypothesis and reject the enhanced-evaporation hypothesis. We suggest that multiple transfer is an adaptive sampling mechanism, which improves foragers' information on colony work allocation, and that multiple sampling is a common feature of social insect societies.","Foraging; Honey-bee; Information improvement; Nectar transfer; Receiver",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035078687

To test the hypothesis that octopamine influences honey bee division of labor we treated bees orally with octopamine or its immediate precursor tyramine and determined whether these treatments increased the probability of initiating foraging. Octopamine treatment significantly elevated levels of octopamine in the brain and caused a significant dose-dependent increase in the number of new foragers. This effect was seen for precocious foragers in single-cohort colonies and foragers in larger colonies with more typical age demographies. Tyramine treatment did not increase the number of new foragers, suggesting that octopamine was exerting a specific effect. Octopamine treatment was effective only when given to bees old enough to forage, i.e., older than 4 days of age. Treatment when bees were 1-3 days of age did not cause a significant increase in the number of new foragers when the bees reached the minimal foraging age. These results demonstrate that octopamine influences division of labor in honey bee colonies. We speculate that octopamine is acting in this context as a neuromodulator.","Apis mellifera; Division of labor; Honey bee; Neuromodulation; Octopamine",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035096859

Patterns with colours presenting only chromatic contrast were also tested. Patterns with higher L-receptor contrast in its outer than in its inner element were better detected than patterns with a reversed L-contrast distribution.

Although the results of this test indicate that the VTD/FA is less effective than Apistan® in controlling varroa mites, the VTD/FA provides a viable alternative varroa mite control in combination with other mite control measures, especially as an early season treatment.","Acarapis woodi; Apis mellifera; Formic acid; Honey bee; Treatment device; Varroa; Varroa destructor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037653780

Ministry of Science and Technology, P.M.B. 1096, Zaria, Nigeria","It is now known that pheromonal communication plays an important role in mammalian behaviour and reproductive processes. Chemical communication with pheromones is one means of transmitting such information. In mammals, signalling and priming pheromones are thought to act either singly or in combination through olfaction, auditory, visual (sight) or tactile stimuli. Pheromones are air-borne chemical substances (""signals"") released in the urine or feces of animals or secreted from cutaneous glands that are perceived by the olfactory system and that elicit both behavioural and endocrine responses in conspecifics. Extensive studies in insects, rodents, swine, sheep, goats and cattle have established the importance of pheromones in the strong influence exerted by the male on reproductive activity in the female. There is a pheromone produced by the queen honey bee, which has two functions: inhibition of queen rearing and suppression of oogenesis in workers and in addition attracts drones during nuptial flight. It has also been demonstrated that the urine of male mice, rats, feral species and other wild rodents contains a priming pheromone that is responsible for hastening puberty in the females. Pheromones in the wool, wax and urine of a ram are sufficient to stimulate ewes to ovulate, while the buck has a strong characteristic seasonal odor and a buck jar containing the odor of the buck can be used as an aid in the detection of oestrus in does. The mere presence of the boar at the time of insemination of the sow improves sperm transport and ovulation, while the presence of the vasectomised bull has been reported to hasten the onset of puberty in heifers and also early resumption of ovarian activity in cattle following parturition. The role of pheromones in bovine reproduction is not as clearly defined as in sheep, goats and swine. Pheromones and other allelomimetic cues can exert profound effects on reproductive activity via the hypothalamic system that generates pulses of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Manipulations of these factors and other pathways linking environmental inputs to reproductive output can lead to developing the concept of ""control systems technologies"", aimed at controlling reproductive performance. The knowledge acquired on the effectiveness of biostimulation; the factor which conditions it and the biological mechanism which produces it in livestock species, allows its use as a breeding management tool. The understanding of the role of pheromones could be of potential economic importance in addressing some of the problems associated with livestock production in the tropics. The biostimulation technique offers a potentially useful and practical way to improve reproductive efficiency in livestock species in the tropics. The exact nature of the cues and the role of biostimulation in livestock species especially swine, sheep, goats and cattle in developing countries require more attention. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.","Biostimulation; Pheromones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035970828

Thorax temperature during dancing was quite variable (31.4-43°C). In the course of a foraging season it varied considerably and was always lower than in bees foraging from a highly profitable food source (2 molar sucrose 120 m from the hive). It averaged 38.0°C (SD=2.24, n=224 dances) in the nectar foragers and 37.4°C (SD=1.64, n=171) in the pollen foragers, resembling that of dancers foraging 0.5 molar sucrose from feeders with unlimited flow. Hive air temperature accounted only for about 3-8% of total variation. Foraging distance modulated dancing temperature in a way that, according to the decrease of the profitability of foraging with distance, maximum temperatures decreased and, in accordance with the increase of the dancing threshold with distance, minimum temperatures increased with distance, this way providing new support for the hypothesis that the dancing temperature is modulated by the profitability of foraging and the dancing and foraging motivation of the bees. Dancing temperature of both nectar and pollen dancers correlated with several parameters of the hive status, increasing with the amount of brood and decreasing with the amount of honey and pollen. These correlations are discussed with respect to literature reports on a colony's need for pollen and nectar, in particular the effect of brood and the amount of pollen on pollen foraging, and the effect of honey stores and demand for nectar on nectar foraging. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Dancing; Honeybee; Thermography Profitability; Thermoregulation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035103205

Not surprisingly, this alanine derivative of TPN Q binds to the channel with much lower affinity. Quantitative thermodynamic cycle analysis shows that deprotonation of the histidine residue reduces the TPN Q-ROMK1 binding energy by 1.6 kcal/mol. To eliminate pH sensitivity but retain high affinity, we derivatized TPN Q by replacing histidine 12 with lysine.

Development of effective control methods is therefore much needed. Study of interspecific chemical communication between the parasite and host is a particularly promising avenue of research. Previous study has shown that the cuticular hydrocarbons of the parasite mite Varroa jacobsoni are qualitatively identical to those of its honey-bee host Apis mellifera (Nation J.L., Sanford M.T., Milne K., 1992. Cuticular hydrocarbons from Varroa jacobsoni. Experimental and Applied Acarology 16, 331-344). The purpose of the present study was to compare the cuticular hydrocarbon patterns of the two species at different stages of bee development. Cuticular components were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The proportion of each component was calculated at three stages of bee development (larvae, pupa, emerging bee). The degree of chemical mimicry between the parasite and host was evaluated by multivariate analyses using the resulting proportions for each category of individuals. There were four main findings. The first was that the proportions of some components are different at the larval, pupal and imago stage of bee development. Second, Varroa profiles vary depending on the developmental stage of the host. Third, the cuticular profile of adult mites is more similar to that of the stage of the host than that of later and/or earlier stages except for parasites collected from emerging adult bees. Fourth, the degree of mimicry by Varroa is greater during larval and pupal stages than during the emerging adult bee stages. The role of chemical mimicry - although it is not perfect - in enabling parasites to infest bee colonies by the parasite is discussed. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Apis mellifera; Chemical signature; Cuticular hydrocarbons; Developmental stages; Mimicry; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035104127

The cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of honey bees were qualitatively similar, for the 3 developmental stages and regardless of the presence of Varroa in the cells. Nevertheless, comparison of the relative proportions of hydrocarbons showed that the cuticular profiles of pupae and emergent adults parasitized by 1 mite and of larvae parasitized by 2 mites were significantly different from the corresponding unparasitized individuals.

Workers almost always have inactive ovaries and the queen monopolises egg laying. Although extremely rare, 'anarchistic' colonies exist in which workers produce male offspring despite the presence of the queen. By comparing the rates of ovary activation in anarchistic and wild-type bees fostered to host colonies of different genotype (i.e. anarchist and non-anarchist) and queen status (i.e. queenless and queenright), we investigated the factors involved in inhibiting ovary activation. Fostered anarchist workers always had a higher level of ovary development than fostered wild-type bees in both anarchist and non-anarchist host colonies. Fostered workers of both genotypes had more active ovaries in anarchistic than in wild-type hosts. Fostered workers of both strains also had more active ovaries in queenless than in queenright hosts. The results suggest that selection for worker reproduction in the anarchistic line has both reduced the effects of brood and queen pheromones on worker ovary inhibition and increased the likelihood that workers of the anarchistic line will develop ovaries compared to wild-type workers.","Anarchy; Apis mellifera; Worker egg laying; Worker sterility",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035154374

Here we test the hypothesis that brood pheromone modulates the sucrose response threshold of bees. Recently the honeybee proboscis extension response to sucrose has been identified as a ""window"" into a bee's perception of sugar. The sucrose response threshold measured in the first week of adult life, prior to foraging age, predicts forage choice. Bees with low response thresholds are more likely to be pollen foragers and bees with high response thresholds are more likely to forage for nectar. There is an associated genetic component to sucrose response thresholds and forage choice such that bees selected to hoard high quantities of pollen have low response thresholds and bees selected to hoard low quantities of pollen have higher response thresholds. The number of larvae in colonies affects the number of bees foraging for pollen. Hexane-extractable compounds from the surface of larvae (brood pheromone) significantly increase the number of pollen foragers. We tested the hypothesis that brood pheromone decreases the sucrose response threshold of bees, to suggest a pheromone-modulated sensory-physiological mechanism for regulating foraging division of labor. Brood pheromone significantly decreased response thresholds as measured in the proboscis extension response assay, a response associated with pollen foraging. A synthetic blend of honeybee brood pheromone stimulated and released pollen foraging in foraging bioassays. Synthetic brood pheromone had dose-dependent effects on the modulation of sucrose response thresholds. We discuss how brood pheromone may act as a releaser of pollen foraging in older bees and a primer pheromone on the development of response thresholds and foraging ontogeny of young bees.","Brood pheromone; Foraging behavior; Honeybee; Neuroethology; Response thresholds",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035147115

From here, processed olfactory information is relayed to higher-order brain centres. A striking similarity in olfactory systems across animal phyla is the presence of glomeruli in this first sensory neuropil. Various experiments have shown that odours elicit a mosaic of activated glomeruli, suggesting that odour quality is coded in an 'across-glomeruli' activity code. In recent years, studies using optical recording techniques have greatly improved our understanding of the resulting 'across-glomeruli pattern', making it possible to simultaneously measure responses in several, often identifiable, glomeruli. For the honeybee Apis mellifera, a functional atlas of odour representation is being created: in this atlas, the glomeruli that are activated by different odorants are named. However, several limitations remain to be investigated.

Bees in colonies receiving brood pheromone initiated foraging at significantly older ages than did bees in control colonies in five out of five trials. Laboratory and additional field tests also showed that exposure to brood pheromone significantly depressed blood titres of juvenile hormone. Brood pheromone exerted more consistent effects on age at first foraging than on juvenile hormone, suggesting that the primer effects of this pheromone may occur via other, unknown, mechanisms besides juvenile hormone.

Mutual policing among workers in social insects can reduce within-colony conflict. However, there are few examples. We tested for worker policing in the common wasp Vespula vulgaris. Workers rapidly removed worker-laid eggs but left most queen-laid eggs (four out of 120 worker eggs versus 106 out of 120 queen eggs remained after 1 h). Ovary dissection (1150 workers from six colonies) revealed that a small but significant number of workers have active ovaries (4%) equivalent to approximately five to 25 workers per colony. Consistent with effective policing of worker reproduction, microsatellite analysis of males (270 individuals from nine colonies) detected no workers' sons. Worker policing by egg eating has convergently evolved in the common wasp and the honeybee suggesting that worker policing may have broad significance in social evolution. Unlike the honeybee, relatedness patterns in V. vulgaris do not explain selection for policing. Genetic analysis (340 workers in 17 nests) revealed that workers are equally related to the queen's and other workers' sons (worker-worker relatedness was 0.51 ± 0.04, 95% confidence interval). Worker policing in V. vulgaris may be selected due to the colony-level benefit of conflict suppression.","Levels of selection; Reproductive conflict; Social insects; Vespinae; Vespula vulgaris; Worker policing",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035931253

Especially relevant is the interaction of these pyridinium ylid complexes with unsaturated substrates such as dihydropyridines, enamines, and β-alkoxy bis(trimethylsilyl) ketene acetals. This latter reaction leads to conjugated carboxylic acids, and has been be applied to a new synthesis of a honey bee pheromone, the queen substance. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.","Conjugated carboxylic acids; Cyclopropanes; Dihydronicotines; Dihydropyridines; Pyridinium ylid complexes; Tungsten",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0346609922

This behaviour can also play an important role in the tolerance of the European honey bee (A. mellifera) towards the mite. The hygienic behavioural response of bees over a period of 24 h towards worker brood cells of A. mellifera iberica artificially infested with varroa was studied. When bees detected cells containing mites, in some instances both brood and mites were removed, whereas in others only the mite was removed. When a single mite was placed in each cell, hygienic behaviour was not induced, only 0.74% of infested cells had mites removed. Using two or three mites per cell, this response increased significantly, with 8.01% and 16.62% of infested cells with mites removed, respectively. A positive correlation (P < 0.05, r = 0.49) was found in hygienic behaviour towards cells artificially infested with two or three mites. A second experiment was conducted to compare the response of bees to live or dead mites inoculated into the cells.

The results of this study have shown that exposure of the semi-isolated heart of the bee to 1, 0.1, and 0.01 μM deltamethrin causes a temporal increase in the frequency and the force of spontaneously generated contractions, which is followed by a decrease in both parameters. The decrease is dose dependent. The action of deltamethrin was not reversible. The fungicide prochloraz applied at the same concentration levels as deltamethrin has an immediate chronotropic and inotropic effect on the semi-isolated heart of the bee, but its effects are more intense than those caused by deltamethrin. Comparison of the dose-response curves clearly shows that prochloraz is more cardiotoxic than deltamethrin. When prochloraz and deltamethrin are combined there is an increase of over 100 times in the cardiotoxicity of deltamethrin and an increase of 10 times in the toxicity of prochloraz. Our suggestion is that this synergistic action could be caused by the action of the. two compounds on the same target site, which in the heart of the bee may be gap junctional intercellular communication, a vital physiological mechanism for the functioning of the heart in both vertebrates and invertebrates. © 2001 Academic Press.","Bee; Cardiotoxicity; Deltamethrin; Heart; Prochloraz; Semi-isolated; Synergy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034808745

(Acari, Mesostigmata). This ectoparasite has caused severe damage to populations of the European honeybee, Apis mellifera, world-wide in recent years. To date, no promising natural enemies of varroa species have been identified on A. mellifera or its original host, Apis cerana. Therefore, biological control will probably require natural enemies from other hosts. The following groups of organisms were reviewed as potential biological control agents: predatory mites, parasitoids and entomopathogens (nematodes, protozoa, viruses, Bacillus thuringiensis, rickettsiae, and fungi). The candidate groups were ranked according to their lethality to Acari, likely ability to operate under the physical conditions of honeybee colonies, ease of targeting, and ease of mass-production. Preferential consideration was given to the natural enemies of Acari that occupy taxonomic groups close to varroa. Entomopathogenic fungi, which kill a wide range of acarine species, were identified as prime candidates for screening against varroa. Bacillus thuringiensis also requires study, particularly strains producing novel toxins active against non-insect hosts. Entomopathogenic protozoa and nematodes show less potential for varroa control, but nonetheless warrant preliminary investigation. We consider predators, parasitoids, viruses and rickettsiae to have little potential to control varroa. Because the physical conditions within honeybee colonies are similar everywhere, it is very likely that a biological control agent of varroa could be used successfully throughout the world.","Acari; Apis mellifera; Bacillus thuringiensis; Biological control; Entomopathogens; Fungi; Nematodes; Parasitoids; Predators; Protozoa; Rickettsiae; Varroa destructor; Varroa jacobsoni; Viruses",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034862885

Worker survival in cohorts of newly emerged bees introduced to colonies in late summer and fall was followed until all marked bees had died. Winter bees were reared over a relatively similar length of time in all treatments, but they appeared earlier in control colonies compared to requeened colonies. The gradual increase in proportion of winter bees over time was similar among treatments, but requeened colonies lagged behind control colonies. The bulk of winter bees appeared much earlier in control colonies than in colonies that were requeened. This response demonstrates that cues within the colony (i.e., differences due to requeening) are perceived by workers as part of the conditions that influence summer bee or winter bee status.","Apis mellifera; Honey bees; Requeening; Winter bees; Worker survival",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034945733

A simple and tractable mathematical model of the honey bee scout-recruit system was developed to study the relationship between nectar availability, the efficiency of the honey bee's recruitment system, and the optimal proportion of scouts that maximizes net gain (benefit - cost), or, energetic efficiency (benefit/cost - 1). The models consider both the energetic costs and benefits of active scouts and recruits as well as the cost of an inactive forager reserve. They predict conditions when individual foraging is favored over the honey bee's recruitment system, when the colony should abandon foraging altogether, and the optimal proportion of scouts (when the scout-recruit system is favored). The models' predictions qualitatively match empirical data. Surprisingly, previous empirical data from the honey bee suggest that recruits' costs are greater than scouts' - recruits spend significantly longer searching for a forage patch than do scouts - thereby causing researchers to rethink how the scout-recruit system might be adaptive. Using average returns, the models demonstrate how the scout-recruit system is adaptive despite these apparent higher recruit costs relative to the scouts'. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the results are robust to a broad range of relative costs of active workers, inactive workers, and the energetic benefits of the forage. Consequently, the model is demonstrated to be relevant to many insect societies that employ a scout-recruit system.","Foraging; Honey bee; Inactives; Recruits; Reserve foragers; Scouts",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035144818

In untreated honeybees, the habituation of the proboscis extension reflex is age-dependent and there is a significant increase in the number of trials required for habituation in older bees (8-10 days old) as compared to very young bees (4-7 days old). Imidacloprid alters the number of trials needed to habituate the honeybee response to multiple sucrose stimulation. In 7-day-old bees, treatment with Imidacloprid leads to an increase in the number of trials necessary to abolish the response, whereas in 8-day-old bees, it leads to a reduction in the number of trials for habituation (15 min and 1 h after treatment), and to an increase 4 h after treatment. The temporal effects of Imidacloprid in both 7- and 8-day-old bees suggest that 4 h after treatment the observed effects are due to a metabolite of Imidacloprid, rather than to Imidacloprid itself. Our results suggest the existence of two distinct subtypes of nicotinic receptors in the honeybee that have different affinities to Imidacloprid and are differentially expressed in 7- and 8-day-old individuals. © 2001 Academic Press.","Apis mellifera; Behavior; Chloronicotinyl; Hymenoptera; Neonicotinoid; Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; Nonassociative learning",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034865712

Long protrusions of the follicle cells reach through the broad perivitelline space and touch the surface of the oocyte. Between the microvilli on the surface of the oocyte an electron-dense material is found, which is taken up into the oocyte by endocytosis on the membrane of the microvilli, in between of them, and in infoldings of the oocyte membrane; in the interior of the oocyte this material is accumulated in big yolk spheres. In the honey bee Apis mellifera (Linnaeus 1758) only pore-like canals are found in the triangular comers formed by three follicle cells. Inside the cells these canals are associated with F-actin filaments. Apically the follicle cells protrude numerous, finger-like protrusions deep into the oocyte, which are densely filled with F-actin filaments. Endocytosis is seen on the surface of the oocyte between the short microvilli and along the surface pockets enclosing the follicle cell fingers.

In standard LD50 laboratory tests, imidacloprid showed high oral toxicity to honeybees (Apis mellifera), with LD50 values between 3.7 and 40.9 ng per bee, corresponding to a lethal food concentration between 0.14 and 1.57 mg kg-1. The residue level of imidacloprid in nectar and pollen of seed-treated sunflower plants in the field was negligible. Under field-growing conditions no residues were detected (limit of detection: 0.0015 mg kg-1) in either nectar or pollen. There were also no detectable residues in nectar and pollen of sunflowers planted as a succeeding crop in soils which previously had been cropped with imidacloprid seed-treated plants. Chronic feeding experiments with sunflower honey fortified with 0.002, 0.005, 0.010 and 0.020 mg kg-1 imidacloprid were conducted to assess potential long-term adverse effects on honeybee colonies. Testing end-points in this 39-day feeding study were mortality, feeding activity, wax/comb production, breeding performance and colony vitality. Even at the highest test concentration, imidacloprid showed no adverse effects on the development of the exposed bee colonies. This no-adverse-effect concentration of 0.020 mg kg-1 compares with a field residue level of less than 0.0015 mg kg-1 (= limit of detection in the field residue studies) which clearly shows that a sunflower seed dressing with imidacloprid poses no risk to honeybees.

The infestation-levels in adult bees varied significantly between colonies (range: 6.6-44.7%), but no differences were found in the brood infestation levels. The variation between colonies was partially genetic in origin. Grooming behavior explained most of the variation (r2 = 0.38). Negative correlations were found between the mite population growth and both the total number of mites and the number of injured mites collected from the bottom-boards (r = -0.65 and r = -0.76, respectively).

We report the structural and functional properties of a honeybee OBP called ASP2, heterologously expressed by the yeast Pichia pastoris. ASP2 disulfide bonds were assigned after classic trypsinolysis followed by ion-spray mass spectrometry combined with microsequencing. The pairing [Cys(I)-Cys(III), Cys(II)-Cys(V), Cys(IV)-Cys(VI)] was found to be identical to that of Bombyx mori OBP, suggesting that this pattern occurs commonly throughout the highly divergent insect OBPs. CD measurements revealed that ASP2 is mainly constituted of α helices, like other insect OBPs, but different from lipocalin-like vertebrate OBPs. Gel filtration analysis showed that ASP2 is homodimeric at neutral pH, but monomerizes upon acidification or addition of a chaotropic agent. A general volatile-odorant binding assay allowed us to examine the uptake of some odorants and pheromones by ASP2. Recombinant ASP2 bound all tested molecules, except β-ionone, which could not interact with it at all. The affinity constants of ASP2 for these ligands, determined at neutral pH by isothermal titration calorimetry, are in the micromolar range, as observed for vertebrate OBP. These results suggest that odorants occupy three binding sites per dimer, probably one in the core of each monomer and another whose location and biological role are questionable. At acidic pH, no binding was observed, in correlation with monomerization and a local conformational change supported by CD experiments.","Dimerization; Insect; Odorant binding; Olfaction; Pheromone; Protein",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034831455

Threshold mite levels indicating miticide application were determined for three possible treatment dates: April, August, and October. The treatments were as follows: (1) fluvalinate in April, (2) fluvalinate in August, (3) fluvalinate in October, (4) fluvalinate in April and October, (5) fluvalinate applied continuously (except during honey flow) with replacement every 42 d, (6) control (no treatment), and (7) coumaphos in April. The number of miticide applications in a season had no effect on brood area or colony bee population a year after initiating the experiment. However, the absence of any treatment significantly reduced brood area and colony bee population and significantly increased colony mite population. Date of treatment had significant effects on colony mortality rates, mite levels, and brood area the following spring. When coupled with sampling and threshold recommendations, a single, late-season application of fluvalinate is as effective for the control of V. destructor as semiannual or continuous miticide applications.

We review a manipulative experiment which tested the hypothesis that multiple mating reduces the genetic load caused by the honey bee sex determination system. Our results suggest that multiple mating (i.e, mating more than once) increases a queen's fitness by lowering the probability that she produces a high proportion of inviable, diploid males within her brood. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between a queen's mating behavior and her mating number. We propose that ""extreme"" polyandry in honey bees (i.e., mating numbers ≥10) may be inadvertent consequences of a queen's mating behavior, therefore additional adaptive arguments are not needed to explain why honey bees have some of the highest mating numbers among the social insects.",,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034800714

We evaluated the genetic basis for interindividual differences in this ability by selecting lines of honeybees that differed in their tendency to reverse a learned discrimination between two odours. We show that individual variation in reversal learning performance, which is an analogue of natural foraging problems such as risk sensitivity, has a heritable component. Selection on drones, which are haploid, was sufficient to obtain a significant selection response after a single generation. In addition, worker age and/or task specialization, in terms of performance of housekeeping versus outside duties, is a source of environmental control over expression of reversal performance. Finally, we identified a correlated response in latent inhibition, in which pre-exposure to a conditioned stimulus (CS) retards learning about that CS when it is subsequently paired with reinforcement. From an ecological standpoint, our results suggest that colonies that contain a variety of genetic lineages may be able to target foragers to learning tasks in which they are genetically predisposed to do well. © 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034973912

We studied the effect of a colony's genotypic composition on the expression of this behaviour among worker bees by creating normal age-structured colonies with different proportions of bees belonging to hygienic and nonhygienic lines. We established four colonies with 0, 25, 50 or 100% of worker bees belonging to the hygienic line. Analyses of the behaviour of hygienic bees in these colonies indicated that the performance of hygienic behaviour depended on the proportion of hygienic bees in the colony. Hygienic bees in the 25% hygienic colony performed the behaviour well beyond middle age and were more persistent at the task compared with bees from the same genetic line in the other colonies. However, the colony with all worker bees from the hygienic line was more efficient in achieving the task despite a lack of persistence. We also observed that in the colony with 50 and 100% hygienic bees, the behaviour was partitioned into subtasks, and some bees performed the subtask of uncapping cells at higher frequencies than the subtask of removing cell contents. These results suggest that a colony's genotypic composition influences the performance and partitioning of hygienic behaviour. We propose that the performance of hygienic behaviour and its partitioning into subtasks could be determined by response thresholds of individual worker bees and that the rate of behavioural ontogeny may be controlled by the demand for specific tasks. © 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034909819

However, only a few studies have explored the variability of this response relative to the age of the bees, and these studies have yielded different conclusions. We aimed to document the effect of age on the proboscis extension response by measuring three parameters in the experimental procedure: the level of spontaneous responses, the acquisition rate, and the resistance to extinction. The performance of the youngest bees (2-day and 4-day-old) differed from those of older individuals for the three parameters, which may be related to the ontogeny of the olfactory system. In older age-groups, only the resistance to extinction was found to vary with age. We discuss the possible relationships between age-dependent variations in the odour learning abilities and the division of labour in the colony.","Age effect; Apis mellifera; Conditioned proboscis extension; Honey bee",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034955969

To study the abundance of males of each type, two apiaries with colonies of African-derived honey bee and European honey bee origin were established in the surroundings of one drone congregation area The frequencies of African-derived honey bee and European honey bee males in the mating area were studied by taking samples of drones at the drone congregation area twice a month for 5 mo. Drones from each type of colony were identified by the use of two allozyme polymorphic systems: malate dehydrogenase (Mdh), hexokinase (Hk), and by haplotype using the EcoRI site of the mitochondrial DNA. The results of a Fisher exact test showed that, although Mdh alleles had similar frequencies across the time of study (P = 0.095), the frequency of Hk alleles and haplotypes in drones varied between months (P = 0.0001). Early in March, the frequencies of African-derived honey bee-typical alleles were significantly higher compared with European honey bee-typical alleles. However, at the end of the season of drone production in July, European honey bee-typical alleles were significantly more frequent in drones than those of the African-derived honey bee type. The results mirror the findings of an early peak of drone brood production reported for African-derived honey bee colonies compared with a peak later in the year in European honey bee ones. It is concluded that the seasonal frequencies of African-derived honey bee and European honey bee drones in the mating areas are not static. They vary in accordance with the different peaks of male production in their respective colonies. This behavior may act as a partial genetic barrier between bee types. The implications of these findings with respect to current levels of Africanization in this region of Mexico and for queen rearing in Africanized areas are discussed. © 2001 Entomological Society of America.","Africanized honey bees; Allozyme; Apis mellifera; Drone; Haplotype; Mating",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1042264182

During these flights bees expose their Nasonov gland, an exocrine gland located at the base of the 7th tergum, that releases a complex blend of volatiles. This behavior may continue even after the bee starts food ingestion. The proportion of bees exposing the Nasonov gland and the duration of its exposure before and during feeding for individual bees were quantified. Trained bees collected sugar solution during 12 visits from a feeder located at 160 m from the hive. Five different reward programs were presented: Three constant and two variable. The constant programs offered 0.6, 1.2 or 2.4 M sugar for all 12 visits, while the variable programs delivered either 0.6, 1.2, 0.6 M or 0.6, 2.4, 0.6 M, four visits for each molarity. Results showed that sugar concentration changed the thresholds and durations of Nasonov gland exposure. However, this relationship was found only for Nasonov exposure before bees began to feed. During feeding, a protruded Nasonov gland was only observed for bees that had exposed it prior to feeding; suggesting that Nasonov gland exposure before feeding is a releaser of the during-feeding exposure. In variable reward programs, changes in sugar concentration were followed by changes in both thresholds and durations of exposure. However, Nasonov gland exposure during feeding did not appear to decrease based on measurements of the low profitability during the current foraging visit. These results suggest that Nasonov gland exposure is programmed on the basis of reward expectations, with the bees having acquired this information in the previous foraging visits to the food source.","Apis mellifera; Communication; Foraging; Honeybees; Nasonov gland",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035685042

After 10 days, the comb produced by each colony was removed, comb measurements made, bees from the comb-building area collected, the size of the scales on the wax mirrors of the collected bees ranked on a scale of 0-4 and the queens removed and analyzed for QMP components. Queenless workers built substantially less comb and the comb they did build had significantly larger, drone-sized cells than for the other 3 treatments, indicating that both cell size and the quantity of comb built are mediated through the queen, particularly QMP. The observations of wax scale size suggested that QMP influenced comb building behaviour rather than wax scale production. These results support the idea that queen-less honey bees can adopt a strategy of constructing drone-sized cells in order to increase reproductive fitness through male production following queen loss.","Apidae; Apis mellifera; Comb construction; Honey bees; Queen mandibular pheromone",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035078133

During these events, workers perform vibration signals on queen cells and emerged queens, and these signals may influence which VQ becomes the new laying queen of a colony. We examined the role of vibration signals during queen competition in two African and six European honeybee colonies. There was pronounced variability in vibration activity between colonies and among queens reared within the same colony. Despite this variation, all colonies showed similar trends in the relationships between the vibration signal and queen replacement. Vibration signals performed on queen cells were not associated with emergence success. Likewise, the signal was not associated with queen emergence order. Early emerging and late-emerging queens were vibrated at similar rates, and there was no clear relationship between emergence order and VQ survival. However, the signals performed on VQs after they emerged were associated with their behaviour and success during the queen elimination period. Emerged VQs that were vibrated at higher rates survived longer, performed more bouts of piping (a characteristic sound produced by queens), eliminated more rivals and were more likely to become the new queens of the colonies. The vibration signal may therefore allow workers a degree of control over the behaviour of emerged VQs, and may influence the outcome of queen competition in honeybees. Differences in vibration activity within and among colonies may reflect differences in the extent to which workers and queens conflict over the timing and outcome of polygyny reduction. © 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034952022

A morphological study carried out with light and transmission electron microscopy showed that the differences in ovary development between the two castes begin as soon as the differential nursing of larvae is initiated. The decrease in ovariole number in worker ovaries is due to a process of cell death occurring in germinative cells and autophagic regression of somatic cells in the ovarioles that commence in the third instar larvae and proceed until the fifth instar where the process is more intense. Germinative cell death leads to ovariole disintegration and incorporation of the remaining somatic cells of the latter into the stromatic cells in such a way that the total volume of the ovary is little affected during larval development, although the ovariole number decreases. By the end of the larval stage, loss of cells is observed among the stromatic cells of the ovary.

Bees responding to low sucrose concentrations show more often the conditioned response during acquisition than those responding only to higher sucrose concentrations. Extinction of conditioned responses depends on the response probability during acquisition.

The distribution of these (RFLPs) alleles (composed of MspI and DdeI variants) had been found previously to be discontinuous among groups of Old World honey bee subspecies, which included A. mellifera mellifera L. (west European), A. m. ligustica Spinola, A. m. caucasica Gorbachev (east European), and A. m. scutellata Lepeletier (African). In this study, ancestry in New World bees was inferred from allele identities and frequencies at this locus in combination with mitochondrial DNA types. In bees from the United States, collected before the invasion of African bees, east and west European alleles were found at frequencies of 83 and 17%, respectively, which is consistent with previously identified nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers. Colonies from two neotropical countries, Mexico and Honduras, had African mitochondrial DNA and high frequencies of African nuclear DNA alleles. Consistent with previous findings, east European alleles were absent or detected at low frequencies in these colonies. However, west European alleles were found at frequencies from 26 to 31%. These results suggest that queen offspring of the African queens first introduced into Brazil mated with west European drones, incorporating neutral markers that have since remained in the expanding population of feral African bees. The results point to little paternal introgression from managed east European colonies encountered by the African bees spreading through the neotropics.","African and European honey bees; Allele frequencies; Apis mellifera caucasica; Apis mellifera ligustica; Apis mellifera mellifera; Introgression",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038750745

The queen is the main reproductive in a colony. Workers cannot mate, but they can lay unfertilized eggs, which develop into males if reared. Worker reproduction, while common in queenless colonies, is rare in queenright colonies, despite the fact that workers are more related to their own sons than to those of the queen. Evidence that worker sterility is enforced by 'worker policing' is reviewed and worker policing is shown to be widespread in Apis. We then discuss a rare behavioural syndrome, 'anarchy', in which substantial worker production of males occurs in queenright colonies. The level of worker reproduction in these anarchic colonies is far greater than in a normal queenright honey-bee colony. Anarchy is a counterstrategy against worker policing and an example of a 'cheating' strategy invading a cooperative system.","Anarchy; Apis mellifera; Worker policing",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034877236

A.m. caucasica exists where honeybee predators typically are rare, while the remaining subspecies have ranges that coincide with areas where honeybee predators are abundant. Foraging decisions of workers visiting artificial flower patches containing blue, white, and yellow flowers were recorded. We tested whether foragers responded to differences in rewarding flower frequency among flower color morphs. Division of labor occurred among foragers of each race; some bees frequented yellow flowers while other bees from the same hive visited blue and white flowers. A.m. caucasica foragers ignored differences in reward frequency among flower colors. Even bees that frequented blue and white flowers did not base flower choice on reward frequency differences between just these two color morphs. In contrast, A.m. armeniaca, A.m. cypria, and A.m. syriaca, however, did respond to differences in reward frequencies, tending to avoid the less frequently rewarding flower color morph. A.m. armeniaca forager division of labor (foragers committed to yellow or to blue and white flowers) was dominant to energy maximization. The reverse was true for A.m. cypria.","Apis mellifera races; Artificial flowers; Foraging; Honey bees; Prey-predator relationship",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035018358

Honey bees appeared in light traps as the first swarms colonized the Panama Canal area. Their numbers followed seasonal trends shown in independent studies, thus indicating bee abundance and activity in a large area. No measurable population-level impact of competition between this invading honey bee and native bees, despite many demonstrations of resource competition at flower patch and colony levels, changed annual abundances of all 15 native bee species. Native bee abundance did not decrease, nor did native bees show substantial reciprocal yearly change with honey bee abundance. One strong negative correlation of bee catches with an extremely rainy year was found. However, multiple regression using rainfall and honey bee abundance as the independent variables showed that neither was responsible for bee population change over 17 years. Nearly half the native species declined during a year that displayed peak honey bee number. That competition from honey bees on an island the size of BCI was necessarily reduced below impact levels expected on the mainland is discussed using a model of resource and consumer density, foraging range, and island size.","African Apis; Impact studies; Neotropical bees",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034949028

A controlled field study of the development of populations of V. destructor shows that P colonies have a strong, genetically based resistance to the parasite. As control colonies (D) were dying with infestations of ca. 10000 mites, P colonies were surviving with infestations of ca. 4000 mites.

As this problem applies to flower recognition by honeybees, Apis mellifera, we asked whether bees transfer acquired information about a previously rewarded pattern to its mirror image and/or its left-right transformation, and which are the mechanisms involved in such a transfer. Bees were trained either with a single pair of patterns or with six different pairs of patterns presented in a random succession. Within each pair one pattern was rewarded and the other not. All patterns had four quadrants, each displaying a different stripe orientation. In multiple-pattern training the six rewarded patterns shared a common configuration different from that of the six nonrewarded ones. After both kinds of training, the bees preferred the mirror image and the left-right transformation of the rewarded pattern (or rewarded configuration) to a novel pattern. They also preferred the left-right transformation to the mirror image. We explain this performance by: (1) matching with a retinotopic template of the trained patterns after training with a single pair of patterns; and (2) matching with a generalized pattern configuration after training with a randomized series of patterns. In the second case, orientations would be bound together in a specific spatial arrangement. Bees would associate a specific orientation with each retinal quadrant and approach the pattern provided that a particular quadrant contains a particular orientation. Although both strategies are based on comparison of an image currently perceived with one that has to be accessed from memory, they constitute different options as the former is less flexible while the latter allows for categorization of novel patterns. © 2001 The Association for the Study of Anirnal Behaviour.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035658969

During the reproductive season the proportion of male eggs laid by queens under insufficiently-food-supplied conditions was lower than that under sufficiently-food-supplied conditions. The smaller proportion of male egg production could not be accounted for by cannibalization of male eggs by workers. The workers' allocation to male cell construction did not differ between sufficiently- and insufficiently-food-supplied conditions. During the non-reproductive season, however, queens showed much reduced or nearly no production of male eggs, even if the colonies were sufficiently supplied with food.

The main issues considered were 1) the relative importance of various insect taxa as Campanula pollinators, 2) the patterns of pollinators' size and activity as a function of altitude, 3) the effect of pollinator exclusion on floral longevity, and 4) the extent to which the morphological difference of C. versicolor from the other Campanula species on Mt Olympos is expressed in its pollinating fauna. The vast majority of Campanula pollinators were solitary bees. Andrenidae and Megachilidae bees (mainly Chelostoma campanulorum) dominated the pollinating fauna of most species. Melittidae and bumblebees were the commonest pollinators of high altitude species. Campanula versicolor differs from the other Campanula species in that its corolla is not bell-shaped but flat. Mainly Apis mellifera, syrphid flies, and carpenter bees, unlike all other Campanula species on Mt Olympos pollinated it. At the species level, rather large altitudinal differences of Campanula populations did not result into large diversification of their pollinating fauna. The insect visitation rate to flowers decreased with altitude. When pollinators were excluded, the floral longevity of the species examined increased three to five times. Neither flower phase (male of female) was consistently favoured in the absence of pollinators. The pollen loads of the different insect taxa (Apis mellifera included) were of variable purity. The majority of Megachilidae bees carried pollen loads of high purity. Pollen loads from insects visiting Campanula species at high altitudes did not differ significantly in their purity from those visiting lowland species. The distribution of Campanula pollinators' body size along the altitudinal gradient exhibited a U-shaped pattern.

Orchis boryi is food deceptive and obligatorily insect pollinated. Primary pollinators were Apis mellifera and Bombus spp., which foraged on rewarding plant species nearby and visited O. boryi in between. To analyse floral colour similarity among rewarding plants and O. boryi as perceived by bees, a model of bee colour vision was employed. For each food plant an index was calculated that described the probability of a bee foraging on it to subsequently choose an orchid flower. This choice probability correlated to colour distance according to the model of bee colour vision, indicating that bees chose the deceptive orchid more frequently if they foraged on more similarly coloured species. At different sites different plant species served as models. Bees foraging on food plants from which a high choice rate to the orchid was observed visited the orchid less often after approaching it than other bees, which is likely to reflect avoidance learning. In general, the pollination syndrome appears to be a generalized form of Batesian mimicry, in which similarity to rewarding plants determines reproductive success. As expected by negative density-dependent selection, individual fruit set and pollinia export rate correlated negatively with orchid density, but were unaffected by food plant density, orchid frequency, individual variation of labellum colour, labellum size, or mouth width of the flowers. © 2001 The Linnean Society of London.","Batesian mimicry; Bee colour vision; Generalist bees; Greece; Orchidaceae; Reproductive success",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034954811

In trial 1, five hives were tested with a modified pollen collector trap and the other five with an 'underbasket' trap. In trial 2, the same hives were used but with different traps. The strength of each colony was measured by counting the spaces between frames occupied by bees. On day 0, 100 dead marked bees were introduced into each hive and trapped bees were counted periodically. More than 91% of the dead bees were collected in both traps with similar results. No relationship was established between efficacy and the strength of the colony, but there was a relationship between efficacy and collection time. There was a direct relationship between the number of spaces between frames full of bees and the time of recovering dead bees.

The test compared the growth of mite populations in colonies of bees that each received one of the following queens: (1) resistant - queens selected for suppression of mite reproduction and artificially inseminated in Baton Rouge with drones from similarly selected stocks; (2) resistant X control - resistant queens, as above, produced and free-mated to unselected drones by one of four commercial queen producers; and (3) control - commercial queens chosen by the same four queen producers and free-mated as above. All colonies started the test with ≈0.9 kg of bees that were naturally infested with ≈650 mites. Colonies with resistant X control queens ended the 115-d test period with significantly fewer mites than did colonies with control queens. This suggests that beekeepers can derive immediate benefit from mite-resistant queens that have been free-mated to unselected drones.

Twenty-four hours after a visit, this effect had worn off. Honeybees visited flowers that had been visited 24 h previously more often than flowers that had never been visited. The same was not true for bumblebees, suggesting that foraging honeybees were also using long-term attractant scent marks, whilst bumblebees were not. Flowers previously visited by conspecifics were repellent to bumblebees and honeybees for ca. 40 min. During this time, nectar replenished in flowers. Honeybees were previously thought to use a volatile chemical (2-heptanone) as a repellent forage-marking scent. We suggest that they may be using a less volatile chemical odour to detect whether flowers have recently been visited, possibly in addition to 2-heptanone. © 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034909825

Although travelling farther to harvest a greater net energetic reward is beneficial, many animals opt for a smaller net reward that requires less travel. Recent discoveries of a visual basis for flower constancy in the honeybee, Apis mellifera, led us to examine older reports that colour cues are superceded by energetic considerations. Here we show that when individual bees foraged on pedicellate artificial flowers varying in colour and interfloral distance, their behaviour depended on the colours in the choice test. Colours of similar spectral reflectance (blue versus white), that would be clustered in the bee's visual colour space, elicited more visits to the closest flower when rewards were equal, but individuals travelled a greater distance to harvest a higher energetic reward when reward quality varied. Bees chose the closest flower more often when reward volume decreased while quality remained constant. Yet, even when all flowers were identical (morphology and reward), and only interfloral distance varied, bees did not always visit the closest flower. A dramatic difference was seen when the dimorphism was yellow-blue, colours quite separate in the bee colour space and known to elicit constancy behaviour. Here, bees visited the closest flower only 5% of the time, and varying reward volume did not elicit different behaviour. Animals thus display differential foraging behaviour with respect to environmental cues that must be considered when asking questions about other behavioural parameters. © 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035179480

Persistent robbing can kill weak colonies. Primarily responsible for preventing robbing are guard bees. Previous research has shown that the probability of both nest mate and non-nest mate workers being accepted by guards at the nest entrance increases as nectar availability increases. The mechanism responsible for this change in guard acceptance can be explained by two competing hypotheses: Odor Convergence and Adaptive Threshold Shift. In this study we tested the Odor Convergence hypothesis. The acceptance by guards at the nest entrance of workers transferred between four colonies that had been fed either odorless sucrose syrup (two colonies) or diluted heather honey (Calluna vulgaris) (two colonies) was measured for 3 days before feeding and during 2 weeks of feeding. Despite the large sample sizes, the probability of guards accepting non-nest mates was not affected by the similarities or dissimilarities in food odor between guards' and non-nest mates' colonies. This finding contrasts with the accepted wisdom that food odors are important in nest mate recognition in honeybees and the data, therefore, strongly reject the Odor Convergence hypothesis.","Adaptive threshold shifts; Conspecific discrimination; Environmentally-acquired odors",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035144951

Using four different treatments (three exclosure types) at flower heads, we observed visitation rates of different pollinators. Honey bees were the most common visitors at each of three transects established at three study locales in California: University of California at Davis, Cosumnes River Preserve, and Santa Cruz Island. A significant correlation existed between honey bee visitation levels monitored in all these transects and the average number of viable seeds per seed head for the same transects. Selective exclusion of honey bees at flower heads using a 3 mm diameter mesh significantly reduced seed set per seed head at all locales. Seed set depression was less dramatic at the island locale because of high visitation rates by generalist halictid bees Augochlorella pomoniella and Agapostemon texanus that penetrated the 3-mm mesh. The introduced megachilid bee Megachile apicalis occurred at all three locales as well (though in much lower numbers) and may contribute to pollination. In an ancillary study, seed set of plants with bagged heads was compared with that of plants without any bagged heads to test for resource shunting effects. These results showed that seed set differences observed between treatments within a single plant were not exaggerated due to resource shunting induced by the bagging technique. Yellow star-thistle may have low or variable levels of self-compatibility (as reflected by low seed set levels in small-mesh bags), increasing the importance of pollination in its breeding system. These results suggest that honey bees and yellow star-thistle may act as invasive mutualists, an association that may extend to other nonnative plant and pollinator species from Eurasia.","Apis mellifera; Centaurea solstitialis; Channel Islands, California; Invasions; Mutualism; Pollination, honey bees and alien plants",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035658949

In a late spring application, formic acid vapours dissipated more rapidly in gel-pack-treated colonies, dropping to an average of < 5 ppm at 13 d post-application. Average concentrations were 15 ppm at 13 d post-application in board-treated colonies. No deleterious effects on adult bee or brood populations were detected. However, formic acid fibreboard-treated colonies stored less honey during the treatment period. In a trial begun in late summer, gel packs, Apilife VAR (containing thymol, eucalyptus oil, menthol and camphor), Apistan (tau-fluvalinate) and oil strips (containing origanum and bay in olive oil) were evaluated. Comparisons of mite drop after a 42-d treatment period indicated Apilife VAR and formic acid gel packs provided control similar to that of Apistan. Oil strips were usually shredded and removed by bees and provided little control. Tracheal mite incidence was reduced 100%, 97% and 92% by formic acid gel packs, oil strips and Apilife VAR, respectively, whereas incidence increased by 75% in untreated colonies. Amounts of bees and brood were less in all treatment groups and in untreated controls. We believe this was a result of natural colony size reduction. Amounts of food stores were unchanged for all treatment groups except there was less honey found in oil-strip treated colonies after treatment. Formic acid vapours from gel packs dissipated less rapidly as ambient temperatures decreased.

Onion seed yields vary enormously depending on the number of honey bees accomplishing pollination. We tested a number of different manipulations and management techniques in commercial hybrid onion seed fields to increase pollinating honey bees and improve yields. Application of materials to attract more honey bees into the fields was tested using BeeScent, Bee-Here, Fruit Boost and Jack Daniels whiskey. Also, Envirpel applied to blooming alfalfa did not repel bees forcing them to forage on an adjacent onion field. We investigated serial introduction of honey bee colonies into the same onion field, feeding honey bee colonies onion syrup, stripping colonies of nectar and pollen, using the Hi-Line onion- collecting honey bee strain, and conducted preliminary selections for colonies that preferred foraging on onion.

Yet, plants and their pollinators currently face a variety of threats including habitat fragmentation, invasive species, and poisoning by pesticides. As land is increasingly converted to human uses, the diversity and abundance of plants and pollinators is likely to decline. Plants with small or low-density populations, including many rare species, can receive fewer pollinator visits, which could lead to fewer seeds, higher selfing rates, and more inbreeding depression. Recent research indicates that introduced honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) can competitively displace native pollinators, and because honeybees are often poor pollinators compared to native bees, the reproductive success of native plants might decline. Application of chemical pesticides can have adverse effects on pollinator populations and reduce natural pollination and subsequent seed set in wild plants. Insecticide-free buffer zones might be needed around some rare plant populations. Plant species that are most vulnerable to pollinator loss are those that depend on a single pollinator species. Many species reduce their risk of pollinator loss via compensatory mechanisms such as multiple pollinators, self-pollination, or by decreasing their dependence on seeds via vegetative reproduction or long life spans. These traits, however, are unlikely to compensate in the long term for a continuous decline in pollination services. Key to slowing the rate of species loss and keeping natural pollination systems intact is habitat preservation. For rare species that depend on pollinators, conservation managers may need to consider factors that influence the welfare of pollinators. Moreover, the size of preserves is important because pollinator nest sites, larval food plants, and foraging sites may be spatially separated and occupy different habitats. Given that pollination interactions often involve multiple species assemblages and large landscapes, a community or ecosystem-based management perspective is needed.","Biodiversity; Habitat fragmentation; Pesticides; Pollination services; Rare species",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035122135

Mudd Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, United States","This study views a honey bee swarm as a supraorganismal entity which has been shaped by natural selection to be skilled at choosing a future home site. Prior studies of this decision-making process indicate that swarms attempt to use the best-of-N decision rule: sample some number (N) of alternatives and then select the best one. We tested how well swarms implement this decision rule by presenting them with an array of five nest boxes, only one of which was a high-quality (desirable) nest site; the other four were medium-quality (acceptable) sites. We found that swarms are reasonably good at carrying out the best-of-N decision rule: in four out of five trials, swarms selected the best site. In addition, we gained insights into how a swarm implements this decision rule. We found that when a scout bee returns to the swarm cluster and advertises a potential nest site with a waggle dance, she tunes the strength of her dance in relation to the quality of her site: the better the site, the stronger the dance. A dancing bee tunes her dance strength by adjusting the number of waggle-runs/dance, and she adjusts the number of waggle-runs/dance by changing both the duration and the rate of her waggle-run production. Moreover, we found that a dancing bee changes the rate of her waggle-run production by changing the mean duration of the return-phase portion of her dance circuits. Differences in return-phase duration underlie the impression that dances differ in liveliness. Although a honey bee swarm has bounded rationality (e.g., it lacks complete knowledge of the possible nesting sites), through its capacity for parallel processing it can choose a nest site without greatly reducing either the breadth or depth of its consideration of the alternative sites. Such thoroughness of information gathering and processing no doubt helps a swarm implement the best-of-N decision rule.","Apis mellifera; Communication; Dance language; Decision making; Honey bees; Swarming",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035033916

Nectar production of quince was found to be small compared to other temperate zone fruit tree species, since quince flowers contained 1.07 - 0.06 mg of nectar on average. Sugar concentration ranged between 21-27 % on average in different years with a range between 9-47.5 %. There was a significant negative correlation between the amount of nectar and its sugar concentration, but no definite difference was established between the ne ctar production of quince cultivars. In spite of this, bee visitation was highly intense about 5.5 bee visits were counted on average at 50 open quince flowers in 10 minutes and about 9.7 flowers out of 50 were visited. This equals about 7 bee visits per flower per day in good weather. Some cultivars tended to be more and less visited by honeybees. Most honeybees tended to collect pollen (51.6 % in average for the 3 years) and usually fewer gathered only nectar (19.9 %), while the rest had a mixed foraging behaviour gathering both (28.5 %). There were slight differences in the foraging behaviour of honeybees on some cultivars, but these differences were not always consequent in consecutive years. Quince is highly sensitive to partial and/or complete limitation of the insect (bee) pollination period. Complete limitation of insect pollination resulted in no yield and partial limitation of the insect pollination period depressed the final set and yield by at least 60-70 % or more. Significant correlation was established between the intensity of honeybee visitation and the consequent yield of quince. As much as 4-5 or 8-10 honeybee visits are needed per day on one flower to achieve the required optimal fruit set that has been declared in the literature to be 20-25 % for quince.","Bee pollination; Bee visitation; Cultivars; Foraging behaviour; Fruit set; Honeybees; Nectar production; Quince (Cydonia oblonga Mill.); Sugar concentration; Yield",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879386634

Extensive losses in pollinator guilds and communities can disrupt ecosystem integrity, a circumstance that today forces most farmers to rely on honey bees for much fruit and seed production. Are North America's invertebrate pollinator faunas already widely diminished or currently threatened by human activities? How would we know, what are the spatiotemporal scales for detection, and which anthropogenic factors are responsible? Answers to these questions were considered by participants in a workshop sponsored by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis in October of 1999, and these questions form the nucleus for the papers in this special issue. Several contributors critically interpret the evidence for declines of bee and fly pollinators, the pollination deficits that should ensue, and their economic costs. Spatiotemporal unruliness in pollinator numbers, particuarly bees, is shown to hinder our current insights, highlighting the need for refined survey and sampling designs. At the same time, two remarkable studies clearly show the long-term persistence of members of complex bee communities. Other authors offer new perspectives on habitat fragmentation and global warming as drivers of pollinator declines. Bees and lepidopterans are contrasted in terms of their natural genetic variation and their consequent resilience in the face of population declines. Overall, many ecologists and conservation biologists have not fully appreciated the daunting challenges that accompany sampling designs, taxonomy, and the natural history of bees, flies, and other invertebrate pollinators, a circumstance that must be remedied if we are to reliably monitor invertebrate pollinator popul tions and respond to their declines with effective conservation measures.","Apiformes; Apoidea; Conservation; Diversity; Insecta; Land-use change; Native invertebrate pollinators; North America; Pollination; Pollinator declines",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002066206

Since then, the mutant was used to obtain (by crossing or selection) a genotype which made nectar easily available to the honeybee. Thus, it appears the genotype took 36 years to obtain. This opinion is supported by a preliminary comparison with Nike, recently considered the best Polish cultivar. The genotype with the short corolla tube did not differ significantly from the standard cultivar Nike with a normal corolla tube when such important features as plant height, green crop and abundance of nectar secretion of individual flowers were considered. However, the genotype revealed more abundant flowering by 20 %, a shorter corolla tube by 25%, a higher sugar efficiency in nectar by 40% (collected from a unit area), more foraging flowers by 1200% (honeybees) and 30% (bumblebees), and a higher seed crop by more than 30% compared to Nike. In addition, differences in crop production may be higher with regard to the shorter corolla tube population cultivated on larger fields because of lack of insects (bumblebee) pollinating the longer tubed flower populations.","Crop; Honeybee foraging; Red clover; Seed setting; Short flower tube",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879397282

'Irwin' cv. trees. Small beehives with two openings, internal and external, were introduced into the cages enabling bees foraging outside the cage to come in contact, in the hive, with bees foraging on the caged tree. The pollen parent of mature fruit embryos was determined by isozyme analysis of mature leaves from seedlings. The hybrid percentage was determined by means of the isozyme loci Pgm-1 and Idh; 'Irwin' is homozygous for both isozyme loci and the potential pollenizers are heterozygous in one of them. Thus, the actual hybrid rate was double the observed rate of heterozygosity. The rates of hybrids were calculated as 18 and 6% in fruit from caged trees with a double-opening and a single-opening hive, respectively. This difference was found to be highly significant. Foreign pollen brought to the hive by bees foraging outside the cage was responsible for the resultant 12% increase in hybrid rate. This is clear proof that in-hive pollen transfer occurs in mango. The novel introduction of two-opening hives with caged flowering plants and parental analysis of the progeny may serve as an effective technique for studying in-hive pollen transfer in self-fertile plants.","Cross-pollination; Honeybee; In-hive pollen transfer; Isozyme analysis; Mangifera indica",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-47749139890

At the same time, it discusses farmers' awareness about pollination failures and their strategies to cope with the crisis by hand pollination. Pollination-related productivity problems in apple crop and farmers' management strategies were studied in six villages (Suangma Shidaguan, Mati Guangming, Daguo Jingzhou Fengyi, Jingzhou Fengyi, Zhongu Shiggu, and Jincu Nanxin) in the Maoxian County of Sichuan Province, China. The findings revealed apple productivity decline in Maoxian was caused by the lack of sufficient floral pollination or total pollination failures. Farmers were aware of it and they understood the significance of ensuring pollination of apple flowers for maintaining crop yield. Hand pollination of apples is a common practice adopted by farmers in Maoxian County of China to make sure that each flower is properly pollinated. It is a massive exercise in a sixty-km long valley in which every family member - men, women and children are involved. Various co-operation mechanisms among farmers have also evolved for sharing labour and skills. The practice of farmers renting honeybee colonies from beekeepers, even though cheap and bees are found in the area, is surprisingly absent. Two possible reasons for this: first, it was not promoted; and second, beekeepers are hesitant to rent their bee colonies because of excessive use of pesticide sprays on apples. Cost-benefit analysis of hand pollination revealed it is a laborious and time-consuming method of pollination. On the other hand, using bees for pollination by these poor farmers can be about eight times cheaper than hand pollination.","Apple; China; Hand pollination; Maoxian county; Pollen",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-62049084130

Eusocial insect colonies present a special case since the fitness of the pathogen depends not only on the ability to infect and spread between individuals within a colony, but also on the ability to spread to new individuals in other colonies. In honey bees, intercolony transmission of pathogens occurs horizontally (by drifting or robbing) and vertically (through swarming). Vertical transmission is likely the most important route of pathogen infection of new colonies. Theory predicts that this should generally select for benign host-parasite relationships. Indeed, most honey bee diseases exhibit low virulence. The only major exception is American foulbrood (AFB).

Subsequent observations showed that Cry1Ba-fed bees did not differ significantly from control bees in the timing of their first flight, the period during which flights took place or in estimated longevity. However, aprotinin-fed bees began to fly and also died about three days sooner than Cry1Ba-fed or control bees. Their flight periods were similar to those of the other bees. The effects of transgenic aprotinin-plants on honey bees will thus depend on gene expression levels in pollen.","Apis mellifera; Aprotinin; Bacillus thuringiensis; Cry1Ba toxin; Proteinase inhibitor; Transgenic plant",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035109839

At a study site in tropical Brazil, the sequence of seven well-defined grooming reactions towards mites of different colonial origin was compared. In a total of 226 assays, Africanized bees responded significantly faster and more intensively than Carniolan workers. But there were no statistical differences in the removal of mites according to the bee types. Even extensive grooming behavior never resulted in damage or death of the mites.

This behavioral development involves acquisition of new tasks that may require advanced learning capabilities. Because acetylcholinesterase (AChE) hydrolyzes acetylcholine, a major neurotransmitter associated with learning in the insect brain, we searched for changes in AChE expression in the brain during bee behavioral development. Biochemical aspects of the AChE protein were similar in foragers and ""nurse"" bees that work in the hive tending brood. However, catalytic AChE activity was significantly lower in foragers. Cloning of bee AChE cDNA enabled mRNA analysis, which demonstrated that the forager-related decrease in AChE activity was associated with decreased AChE mRNA levels. This was particularly apparent in the mushroom bodies, a brain region known to be involved with olfactory and visual learning and memory. In addition, treatment with the AChE-inhibitor metrifonate improved performance in an olfactory-learning assay. These findings demonstrate long-term, naturally occurring developmental downregulation of AChE gene expression in the bee brain, and suggest that this genomic plasticity can contribute to facilitated learning capabilities in forager bees.","Acetylcholinesterase; Behavioral development; Expression; Honey bee",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034808726

Introduced honeybees are now the most frequent visitors to the inflorescences of the self-compatible, bird-pollinated Australian shrub Grevillea macleayana and may therefore be expected to have altered the mating system. To examine the degree to which birds continue to play a role in determining the mating system of G. macleayana in this disturbed system, we compared outcrossing rates in open-pollinated inflorescences with inflorescences from which birds had been selectively excluded. Outcrossing rates were estimated from the microsatellite genotypes of over 100 seeds per population in three populations. Outcrossing rates (t) in open-pollinated seeds were surprisingly low (0.062-0.225) and did not vary significantly among the three populations. Nevertheless, outcrossing was significantly lower when birds were excluded (data pooled from all populations). Two lines of evidence suggest that there are temporal fluctuations in outcrossing rate and hence that birds usually have a major effect on the mating system of G. macleayana. First, at one site, t was substantially lower than estimates from an earlier study (0.06 in 1995 cf. 0.85 in 1990). Second, fixation indices based on seeds were high in all populations (>0.68), whereas values for the established plants (parental generation) were much lower in two of the three populations (0.06-0.32). Our findings suggest that honeybee activity is so high that the contribution of birds to pollination in G. macleayana is sometimes relatively trivial.",,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035677959

Spores represent the infectious stage; when ingested by a larva they germinate in the midgut. The rod-shaped vegetative forms penetrate the larva's intestinal tissue and start multiplying rapidly, which finally kills the larva. Spores fed to adult honeybees, however, do not harm the bees. We investigated this phenomenon. Specifically, we studied the influence of the adult honeybee midgut on the vegetative growth and on the germination of spores of P. larvae larvae. We focused on two groups of adult workers that are likely to have large numbers of spores in their gastrointestinal tracts in infected colonies: middle-aged bees, which are known to remove or cannibalize dead larvae and clean brood cells, and winterbees, which do not have frequent chances to defecate. We found that midgut extract from winterbees and worker-aged bees of different colonies almost completely inhibited the growth of the vegetative stage of P. larvae larvae and suppressed the germination of spores. The inhibiting substance or substances from the adult midgut are very temperature stable: they still show about 60% of their growth-inhibiting capacity against this bacterium after 15 min at 125°C.

Diffusion tests on agar plates showed that the peptide fraction had an inhibitory effect against the honeybee pathogen Paenibacillus larvae larvae, the primary pathogen of Amerìcan foulbrood disease, as well as against other Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis and Sarcina lutea. Moreover, the peptide fraction was shown also to have antifungal effect against the model fungus Botrytis cinerea. It is the first evidence of an antibiotic effect of royalisin against a honeybee pathogen. The procedure described is very simple and does not require application of complicated separation techniques.

Furthermore addition of the prenyl group or the presence of the hydroxy group at position 7 of the flavonoid may play an important role for increasing the inhibition of tyrosinase.

Prunus and Salix accounted for 62% of the total, by volume. Through feeding tests performed with queenless micro-colonies, consumption and nutritive value of Prunus pollen was compared to those of two other pollens: Salix, also frequently collected by queens and Taraxacum which was never found in their crop. If honeybee loads of Prunus and Taraxacum were presented to workers, Prunus consumption was 2.5 times higher than that of Taraxacum. When honeybee loads were mixed with syrup to make pollen pastes of pure Prunus or Taraxacum and blends containing 10%, 50% and 90% of the other pollen, pure Prunus paste was consumed 4 to 12 times more than pastes with 50% to 100% Taraxacum. The nutritive value of the three pure pollens was estimated by the comparison of their effect on the reproductive success of queenless micro-colonies composed of three callow workers. Prunus, Salix and Taraxacum pollen resulted in similar effects on worker survival and egg clump deposition. Taraxacum pollen significantly affected ovary maturation estimated by the delay of the first eggs laid (10.6 days) compared to Prunus and Salix (7.6 days). Taraxacum did not enable production of males whereas Salix and Prunus resulted in male offspring production (8 and 19 males per micro-colony respectively). Prunus resulted in significantly higher performances than Salix in terms of oophagy (7.6 % versus 38% of egg clumps eaten), whereas Taraxacum resulted in 88% oophagy which is significantly higher than oophagy with Salix. Therefore, oophagy would be the more discriminant criterion when pollen nutritive value has to be tested comparatively. Protein rates were 27%, 20% and 17% in Prunus, Salix and Taraxacum, respectively. Protein efficacy ratios (number of males produced / weight of protein consumed) were 10.1, 6.6, and 0, respectively. These figures suggest that an amino-acid deficiency or inadequate balance affected the nutritive value of Salix and especially Taraxacum, compared to that of Prunus.","Attractiveness; Bombus terrestris; Laboratory assessment.; Nutritive value; Pollen collection",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042682877

The mite needs to be on the brood almost constantly. Mite infestation is more severe during active brood rearing periods. On hatching, the nymph feeds on the haemolymph of capped larvae and pupae, and adult mites finally emerge out from the infested cells. Adult bees do not emerge or the affected brood develops into deformed adults. Inspection of hives severely infested by the mite reveals an irregular pattern of sealed and unsealed brood. Since adults of T. clareae can survive without bee brood as food for only 2 days, restricting of brood production combined with chemical treatment can control the mite pest. Bees and queens should be subject to inspection by veterinary service at the time of importation for the purpose of determining whether they are eligible to be imported to places free of T. clareae. Veterinarians and beekeepers should constantly monitor the hives for the presence of exotic mites to prevent a threat to the health and welfare of bees.","Honey bee; Prophylactic and control measures; Tropilaelaps clareae",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034747459

In this work we use nonlinear models for the quantitative identification of the spatial and temporal properties of the Ca2+-dependent fluorescence signal. This technique describes time series of the Ca2+ signal as a superposition of biophysically motivated model functions for photobleaching and Ca2+ dynamics and provides optimal estimates of their amplitudes (signal strengths) and time constants together with error measures. Using this method, we can reliably identify two different stimulus-dependent signal components. Their delays and rise times, δc1 = (0.4 ± 0.3) s, τc1 = (3.8 ± 1.2) s for the fast component and δc2 = (2.4 ± 0.6) s, τc2 = (10.3 ± 3.2) s for the slow component, are constant over space and across different odors and animals. In chronological experiments, the amplitude of the fast (slow) component often decreases (increases) with time. The pattern of the Ca2+ dynamics in space and time can be reliably described as a superposition of only two spatiotemporally separable patterns based on the fast and slow components.

An anomalous sharp change of the remanent magnetization is observed at 67 ± 0.2 K for migratory ants. The IRM at room temperature indicates the presence of at least 10 times lower concentration of magnetic material in the whole fire ant as compared to the migratory ant abdomen (0.22 ± 0.33 × 10 -6 emu/ant, and 2.8 ± 1.2 × 10-6 emu/abdomen, respectively). Our results in honeybee abdomen (4.6 ± 0.9 × 10-6 emu/abdomen) agree with other reported values. IRM at room temperature in ants and honeybees indicates the presence of single domain (SD) or aggregates of magnetite nanoparticles. The loss of remanence from 77 to 300 K can be related to the stable-superparamagnetic (SPM) transition of small particles (less than ca. 30 nm). From these values and considering their estimated volumes an upper limit 1010 SPM. and 109 SD or aggregate particles are obtained in these insects. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

This study evaluates aspects of sexual reproduction, such as floral morphology, pollination ecology, production and viability of pollen grains, apomixis, seed production and seed germination of cassava landraces collected in gardens of “caboclos” and Indians of the Amazon region and São Paulo State, both in Brazil. The aspects of the reproductive biology were studied from field evaluations and collection of flower buds and seeds. The experiments were carried out in Piracicaba, SP. Alteration was verified in the floral morphology of the landrace DG-55, which showed hermaphrodite flowers, and DG-65 and variety Mantiqueira, which presented smaller number of ovules per ovary. Honeybee (Apis mellifera) was the main pollinator of cassava. There was significant variation in the number and viability of pollen grains. The superior anters of the masculine flower presented, significantly, large number of pollen grains. Apomixis was not detected. A larger number of fruits with two or three seeds were detected. However, seeds originating from fruits with a single seed presented higher germination rates. The morphological alterations in the floral structure influenced the seed production and viability. The variation observed in the aspects of the reproductive biology, was probably due to differentiated selective pressure to which the landraces were submitted along the domestication process. © 2001, Scientia Agricola.

Strains differed significantly in their retinue response to QMP after one generation of selection. By the third generation the high strain was on average at least nine times more responsive than the low strain. The strains showed seasonal phenotypic plasticity such that both strains were more responsive to the pheromone in the spring than in the fall. Directional selection for low seasonal variation indicated that phenotypic plasticity was an additional genetic component to retinue response to QMP. Selection for high and low retinue responsiveness to QMP was not an artifact of the synthetic blend because both strains were equally responsive or non-responsive to whole mandibular gland extracts compared with QMP.

In an 18-month survey of European honey bees (EHB) and Africanized honey bees (AHB), we showed that EHB were highly compatible with V. jacobsoni, while AHB were not as compatible. Furthermore, mite infertility ('parasite infectivity' factor), suspected to be the main factor of low AHB/V. jacobsoni compatibility in Brazil, was not observed in Mexico. The 'intrinsic rate of natural increase' of mites did not differ significantly between host subspecies, indicating that the cause of low compatibility appears only at high parasite densities. The 'carrying capacity' was twice as high in EHB as in AHB, indicating that the cause of low compatibility is possibly linked to honey bees' behavior. We hypothesize that the reason why V. jacobsoni is highly fertile on Mexican AHB (whereas it has low fertility on Brazilian AHB) may be that different strains of V. jacobsoni exist in the two countries.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033665482

Here we have compared the subfamily hydrocarbon profiles of 5-day-old workers maintained in isolation with those kept in their parental colony. We demonstrate that the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles tend to be less distant between most subfamilies within the hive compared with those held in isolation. The main consequence of this partial homogenization of the majority of subfamily signatures may result in a reduction of the number of recognizable subfamilies in the colony.

Treatment with thymol (n = 24) resulted in an average mite mortality of 75.4 ± 5.79%, significantly less than that attained with Apistan or formic acid. The addition of essential oils did not affect treatment efficacy of either formic acid or thymol. The ratio of the coefficients of variation for percentage mortality for the formic acid (CVFA) and Apistan (CVA) groups was CVFA/CVA = 0.66. This indicates that the formic acid treatment was as consistent as the Apistan treatment. Thymol treatments did not provide as consistent results as Apistan or formic acid. Coefficient variation ratios for percentage mortality for the thymol group (CVT) with the Apistan and formic acid groups were CVT/CVA= 4.47 and CVT/CVFA = 6.76, respectively. In a second experiment, colonies received a 4-wk fall treatment of either 300 ml of 65% formic acid (n = 24) or four, 10% strips of Apistan (n = 6). The next spring, mite levels in the formic acid group (554.3 ± 150.20 mites) were similar to those in the Apistan treatment group (571.3 ± 145.05 mites) (P = 0.93). Additionally, the quantities of bees, brood, pollen, and nectar/honey in the two treatment groups were not significantly different (P ≥ 0.50 each variable).

The application of insecticides (Polo 500 EC Primor 50 W) each 617.50 ml/ha was done only once under caged plot environment of 4x5x6 feet area. Twenty five individuals of honey bees were released in each treatment at 0, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours after insecticide application. For foraging behaviour, number of honeybees' visits per 10 minutes per flower on alternate days during January and Fehruary were recorded. Role of honeybees towards pollination was observed by recording seed yield, 1000 grain weight and by testing germination percentage of the seed of Brassica. For these studies, 1st caged plot was meant to be pollinated only by honey bees, 2nd caged plot to be pollinated only by wind and 3rd was kept open, as control (Honeybees + Wind + Other pollinators). Polo proved as a safer insecticide showing minimum mortality of honeybees as compared to Primor at all post treatment intervals. The mortality, however, ranged from 4.00 to 9.00 as against 9.67-24.67 per 25 individuals in case of Polo and Primor, respectively. The maximum average number of visits of worker honeybees was recorded during 1000-1100 hours (25.21/flower/10 minutes) followed by the rest of the individuals in a day. The honeybees proved a good source of pollination, resulting a maximum seed yield (19.90 Q/ha.), maximum 1000 grain seed yield (3.813 gm) and maximum germination percentage (95.80%). Thus seed pollinated by honeybees was found to be healthy and of good quality.","Bee foraging; Bee mortality; Pollination; Polo; Primor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034457622

Injection of 1-5 μg of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) into unpigmented pupae showed a dose- and stage-dependent effect. The higher the dose and the later the injection was performed, the more pronounced was the delay in cuticle pigmentation. This inhibition of cuticular melanization by artificially elevated ecdysteroid titers was corroborated by in vitro experiments, culturing integument from unpigmented, dark-eyed pupae for 1-4 days in the presence of 20E (2 or 5 μg/ml culture medium). Topical application (1 μg) of pyriproxyfen to unpigmented, white-eyed pupae had the opposite effect, leading to precocious and enhanced melanization of the pupal cuticle. In vitro incubation of integuments in the presence of this juvenile hormone analog (1 μg/ml) confirmed these results, showing that pyriproxyfen is apparently capable of triggering melanization. The in vivo mode of action of pyriproxyfen was further investigated by quantifying hemolymph ecdysteroids by radioimmunoassays. Topical application leads to a delay of the pupal ecdysteroid peak by 4 days. The pyriproxyfen-induced low ecdysteroid titers during early pupal development could account for precocious pigmentation by removing an inhibition on prophenoloxidase activation normally imposed by the elevated ecdysteroid titer during this phase. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.","20-Hydroxyecdysone; Cuticle pigmentation; Honeybee; Juvenile hormone; Metamorphosis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034534679

Larvae that carried the construct also expressed the introduced DNA. We propagated several trensgenic lines for up to three generations, which demonstrates its heritability. Once carried by e queen, the construct can be detected in that queen's larvae over several months.

For bees, parental provisioning behavior largely controls offspring body size. Because larger offspring of many bee species have fitness advantages, selection on body size should act through selection on parental provisioning behavior and restrict body size variation of each species. Many bee species show great variability in body size, however, which may indicate that adult females are often constrained in their ability to consistency produce large offspring. We compared body size variation within bee species for two life history Iraits that could influence offspring body size: dietary breadth (specialist or generalist) and nesting habit (ground-nesting or cavity-nesting). We determined the head width (a reliable correlate of body size) of 2276 bees belonging to 31 bee species from five families and calculated the body size variation for each species. Body size variation, measured as the coefficient of variation in head size, did not differ between pollen specialists (oligoleges) and pollen generalists (polyleges) across 13 pairs of closely-related, sympatric bee species of similar body size. Cavity-nesting species showed significantly greater variation in body size than ground-nesting species, which suggests that the choice of nest cavities utilized may be a more important predictor of offspring body size than parental body size. The cleptoparasite Coelioxys sayi had similar body size variation to one of its hosts, Megachile brevis. The European honey bee, Apis mellifera, showed the least body size variation of any species measured.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034443945

I examined the limitations of spermatozoal survival at nonfrozen temperatures. Pooled, diluted semen was stored in sealed capillary tubes at room temperature (25°C) or in a refrigerator set to 12°C, for periods up to 1 yr. Survival of spermatozoa was assayed by a dual fluorescent staining technique using SYBR-14 and propidium iodide stains, which readily distinguishes live and dead cells. No significant loss of viable spermatozoa occurred within the first 6 wk. Between weeks 6 and 9, the percent live spermatozoa fell from 80 to 58%, and remained at that level until after 39 wk. By week 52, samples at room temperature, but not at 12°C, fell to 18.9% live spermatozoa. Nonfrozen storage of honey bee semen has potential for short-term preservation of germplasm, however several factors need to be studied further to optimize survival rates.","Apis mellifera; Artificial insemination; Germplasm preservation; Propidium iodide; Spermatozoa; SYBR-14",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034199508

Bees and mites were exposed to applications of essential oil constituents in petri dishes (60 by 20 mm). The registered mite control agents tau-fluvalinate (Apistan) and formic acid also were evaluated as positive controls. Treatments that caused high mite mortality (&gt;70%) at doses that produced low bee mortality (&lt;30%) were considered mite selective. The six most selective of the 22 treatments tested (clove oil, benzyl acetate, thymol, carvacrol, methyl salicylate, and Magic3) were further evaluated to estimate LD50 values and selectivity ratios (A. mellifera LD50/V. jacobsoni LD50) at 24, 43, and 67 h after exposure. Tau-fluvalinate was the most selective treatment, but thymol, clove oil, Magic3, and methyl salicylate demonstrated selectivity equal to or greater than formic acid. The effect of mode of application (complete exposure versus vapor only) on bee and mite mortality was assessed for thymol, clove oil, and Magic3 by using a 2-chambered dish design. Estimated V. jacobsoni LD50 values were significantly lower for complete exposure applications of thymol and Magic3, suggesting that both vapor and topical exposure influenced mite mortality, whereas estimated values for clove oil suggested that topical exposure had little or no influence on mite mortality. These results indicate that essential oil constituents alone may not be selective enough to control Varroa under all conditions, but could be a useful component of an integrated pest management approach to parasitic mite management in honey bee colonies. © 2000 Entomological Society of America.","Apis mellifera; Bioassay; Essential oils; Tau-fluvalinate; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034167634

Some beekeepers have minimized their losses by routinely treating their colonies with menthol, currently the only Environmental Protection Agency-approved and available chemical for tracheal mite control. Menthol is also expensive and can interfere with honey harvesting. Because of inadequate sampling techniques and a lack of information concerning treatment, this routine treatment strategy has increased the possibility that tracheal mites will develop resistance to menthol. It is important to establish economic thresholds and treat colonies with menthol only when treatment is warranted rather than treating all colonies regardless of infestation level. The use of sequential sampling may reduce the amount of time and effort expended in examining individual colonies and determining if treatment is necessary. Sequential sampling also allows statistically based estimates of the percentage of bees in standard Langstroth hives infested with mites while controlling for the possibility of incorrectly assessing the amount of infestation. On the average, sequential sampling plans require fewer observations (bees) to reach a decision for specified probabilities of type I and type II errors than are required for fixed sampling plans, especially when the proportion of infested bees is either very low or very high. We developed a sequential sampling decision plan to allow the user to choose specific economic injury levels and the probability of making type I and type II errors which can result inconsiderable savings in time, labor and expense. © 2000 Entomological Society of America.","Acarapis woodi; Apis mellifera; Bee mortality; Honey bee; Sequential sampling; Tracheal mite",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034198561

Classical olfactory learning experiments have shown that the mushroom bodies (MBs), a prominent neuropil of the central nervous system of the bee, are involved in olfactory learning and memory formation. We tested whether the MBs are also involved in tactile antennal learning. As in olfactory learning, bees use the antennae during tactile learning to sense tactile cues. We produced specific MB ablations by applying the mitotic blocker hydroxyurea (HU). In Drosophila, HU-induced brain lesions of the MBs strongly impaired olfactory memory formation. As treatment with HU might also interfere with the processing of the reward stimulus, sucrose, we measured the responsiveness to sucrose stimuli in these bees. Treatment with HU led to partial ablations of the median MB subunits on one or both sides of the brain. We analysed sidespecific effects in double-blind tests, testing sucrose responsiveness separately for each antenna, and conditioning first one antenna and then the other in a reversal learning assay. HU-treated bees without detectable ablations were less responsive to sucrose and had a poorer learning performance than untreated controls. Partial MB ablation did not additionally affect responsiveness to sucrose or tactile antennal learning. Interestingly, bees with bilateral MB ablations did not differ from untreated controls in their learning performance during the first learning phase. During reversal learning, acquisition in these bees was significantly lower than that in untreated controls. It is concluded that HU treatment affects sucrose responsiveness and tactile learning even without detectable ablation of neuropils. The effects of MB ablations on tactile learning are not side-specific and not correlated with the volume of the ablated neuropil. © Springer-Verlag 2001.","Apis mellifera; Chemical ablation; Learning; Mushroom bodies; Sucrose reward",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000127527

Manipulations of colony age structure and flight experience were used to test whether differences in performance are associated with age, current behavioral state, or flight experience. Nurse bees showed significantly faster rates of extinction to a learned odor than did foragers. This difference was associated primarily with differences in behavioral state, rather than age; it was seen when comparing nurses and foragers from typical colonies and normal-age nurses and precocious foragers from single-cohort colonies. Differences in extinction rate were not related to differences in flight experience; there was no difference between foragers and foraging-age bees denied flight experience.

This scheme is currently in the process of being revised by EPPO/CoE. A major change will be the recommendation for the generation and use of 'Dose Response' toxicity data instead of limit test data. In addition, the revised EPPO/CoE Non-target Arthropods Risk Assessment Scheme will replace the current arbitrary 30% threshold trigger value applied to limit test data, with a Hazard Quotient (HQ; = Ratio Application Rate/LC50 on Glass), comparable to the successful approach adopted in the EPPO/CoE 'Honeybee Risk Assessment Scheme'. However, in order for this new approach to be implemented under 91/414/EEC, an appropriate regulatory HQ trigger value needs to be derived. Such an HQ trigger value has been established by calculating HQ values for the 2 recommended sensitive indicator species (T. pyri and Aphidius) for a wide range of products and validating opposite robust semi-field/field data. This validation indicated that an HQ trigger value of ≥ 12 for T. pyri and ≥ 8 for Aphidius spp., should be used to trigger higher-tier risk assessment and/or higher-tier testing for non-target arthropods. As these trigger values were validated with realistic semi-field/field data they apply for both lethal and sub-lethal effects as well as single and multiple application scenarios. Due to the worst case assumptions used in this HQ validation analysis, no further uncertainty factors need to be applied for in-crop risk assessment. Whilst a small amount of uncertainty exists regarding the comparative sensitivity of T. pyri and Aphidius spp. for off-crop non-target arthropod guilds of arthropods, this is balanced by the fact that the off-crop exposure assessment used in the HQ derivation, is at least an order of magnitude higher than that realistically likely in the field. This HQ approach and trigger value is an appropriate and conservative tool for tier 1 risk assessment, which should reduce the number of false positive results leading to unnecessary higher-tier testing.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033740644

Purified acetylcholinesterase (AChE) from electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) and carboxylesterases from a homogenate of honeybee heads (Apis mellifera) were used as esterases, each having different affinities for the substrates S-acetylthiocholine-iodide (ATC) and N-methylindoxylacetate (MIA). MIA hydrolysis by honeybee homogenate was more sensitive to inhibition by organophosphate insecticides than ATC hydrolysis by purified AChE, although the latter parameter is often used for in vitro monitoring of esterase inhibitors. The higher sensitivity of carboxylesterases is attributed to the instant formation of a reversible Michaelis-Menten complex with the inhibitor, which competes with MIA for the active sites of the free enzymes. This dose-dependent instant inhibition can be quantified with kinetics for competitive inhibition at dichlorvos concentrations <16 nM. At similar concentrations, purified AChE was not instantly inhibited, whereas both AChE and carboxylesterases were irreversibly and progressively inhibited at higher dichlorvos concentrations (IC50(10min) ≥ 0.1 μM). Honeybee homogenate mediated MIA hydrolysis was applied as the most sensitive enzyme-substrate combination for experiments with fractionated extracts of 4 rainwater samples collected in a natural conservation area. Most esterase inhibiting potency was found in the polar methanol fraction, with recalculated concentrations equivalent to 12-125 ng dichlorvos per liter rainwater.","Apis mellifera; Carbamates; Esterase; N-methylindoxylacetate; Organophosphate insecticides; Rainwater",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033753166

However, no one had measured both dance duration and liveliness as a function of food-source profitability. Using video analysis, we found that nectar foragers adjust both the duration (D) and the rate (R) of waggle-run production, thereby tuning the number of waggle runs produced per foraging trip (W, where W = DR) as a function of food-source profitability. Both duration and rate of waggle-run production increase with rising food-source profitability. Moreover, we found that a dancing bee adjusts the rate of waggle-run production (R) in relation to food-source profitability by adjusting the mean duration of the return-phase portion of her dance circuits. This finding raises the possibility that bees can use return-phase duration as an index of food-source profitability. Finally, dances having different levels of liveliness have different mean durations of the return phase, indicating that dance liveliness can be quantified in terms of the time interval between consecutive waggle runs.","Apis mellifera; Communication; Dance language; Foraging; Waggle dance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033759950

In the case of poor pollination by honeybees, a number of costly techniques is applied to enforce fruit set - often with poor results.

Using a sarcosyl/urea extraction, we were able to fractionate the microtubular cytoskeleton of the sperm flagellum of the insect Apis mellifera resulting in the dissociation of the axonemal microtubule protein components and the accessory tubules. This has allowed us to compare the tubulin isoform content of axonemal microtubules and accessory tubules by immunoelectron microscopy and immunoblotting using a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against different tubulin post-translational modifications (PTMs). All the PTMs occurring in axonemal tubulin are also present in accessory tubules, which indicates the close relativeness of accessory tubules to axonemal rather than to cytoplasmic microtubules. However, our results demonstrate the presence of significant differences in the tubulin isoform content of axonemal microtubules and accessory tubules. First, the tubulin tyrosination extent of accessory tubules is far lower than that of axonemal microtubules, thus confirming at the molecular level their morphogenetic origin as outgrowths from the B-subtubule of each microtubular doublet. Second, although polyglycylation seems to occurr at the same extent in both microtubular systems, α-tubulin exhibits a larger amount of monoglycylated sites in axonemal microtubules than in accessory tubules. Third, a greater amount of β-tubulin molecules is glutamylated in axonemal microtubules than in accessory tubules. Moreover, highly acidic isoforms, likely molecules with longer polyglutamate side chains, are present only in axonemal microtubules. Taken together, our data are indicative of a higher level of tubulin heterogeneity in axonemal microtubules than in accessory tubules.

Highly flexible lipid bilayers anchored via a hydrophilic spacer terminated by a thiol group onto gold were used to investigate the influence of melittin on the electrical parameters of membranes by means of ac impedance analysis. A melittin induced increase in the capacitance and conductivity of the membrane was observed suggesting that melittin induces defects within these immobilized lipid bilayers. Experiments were performed in the absence and presence of EDTA to investigate the influence of remaining phospholipase A2 in the melittin sample as well as the sole impact of phospholipase A2 from Apis mellifera. It was shown that the most pronounced influence of melittin on the electrical parameters of bilayers was found when EDTA was absent, revealing a synergistic effect of phospholipase A2 and melittin. Morphological changes of solid supported membranes induced by the combined effect of melittin and phospholipase A2 were visualized by TappingMode scanning force microscopy in aqueous solution. Dissolution of the lipid layer and the formation of non-lamellar, discoid structures was observed within minutes after addition of melittin, supporting a 'carpet-like' mechanism of peptide action leaving mixed peptide lipid micelles behind.

Waggle dances of honey-bees (Apis mellifera L.) were decoded to determine where and how far the bees foraged during the blooming of heather (Calluna vulgaris L.) in August 1996 using a hive located in Sheffield, UK, east of the heather moors. The median distance foraged was 6.1 km, and the mean 5.5 km. Only 10% of the bees foraged within 0.5 km of the hive whereas 50% went more than 6 km, 25% more than 7.5 km and 10% more than 9.5 km from the hive. 2. These results are in sharp contrast with previous studies in which foraging distances were much closer to the hive. In May 1997 the mean foraging distance was 1 km, showing that long-range dancing is not the rule in Sheffield. 3. The observed foraging distances described in this study may not be exceptional in a patchy environment where differences in patch size and patch quality are large. When travel distances to patches are large, distant patches can probably be utilized only by individuals that live in groups and recruit foragers to the patches found. Only then are the benefits of scouting for distant patches high enough to enable the exploitation of these patches.","Central-place foraging; Patch size and quality; Social foraging; Spatial heterogeneity; Travel distance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033825613

We offered free-flying bees a dimorphic artificial patch of radial and bilateral blue/white flowers in order to examine three hypotheses to explain the noted increase in visitation to the flower type offering a lower caloric reward, i.e., optical resolution, dyslectic interpretation, and cognition related to pattern colors. When bees were offered a color pattern rather than a simple color difference to differentiate flower types, they did not always make choices predicted by theory. Honeybees foraged randomly on both flower morphs when rewards were equal and chose the higher caloric reward more often when rewards were different. However, they visited the less rewarding choice more than 33% of the time. Increasing the size of the flower surface by doubling the dimensions did not decrease visitation to the less rewarding flower type, suggesting that visual acuity is not the limiting factor in flower sizes used. When flower colors that increased contrast (yellow vs. blue) were used in the dimorphic patch, visitation rate to the less rewarding flower type did not decline, nor did this 'error rate' decrease when identical patterns were used with only partial color differences. Adding an orientation reference on each flower decreased the frequency with which the less rewarding flower type was chosen from 36 to 26%, possibly because foragers were induced to switch from a global cue (e.g., patch) to a local cue (e.g., flower). The rate with which the less rewarding flower type is chosen appears to be a function of honeybee use of cognitive and sensory modalities, rather than limited memory and correlative abilities.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034923411

The procedure, though applicable to N-glycosylated glycoproteins of any origin, is particularly devised for glycoproteins potentially containing fucose in α1,3-linkage to the reducing GlcNAc as may be found in plants and invertebrates, e.g., insects and parasitic helminths. Starting with an established procedure for mass spectrometric peptide mapping, the analysis of N-glycans by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry involved the use of peptide:N-glycosidase A, a triphasic microcolumn for sample cleanup, and a new matrix mixture consisting of 2,5-dihyhydroxybenzoic acid, 1-hydroxyisoquinoline, and arabinosazone. The method was tested on proteins with N-glycans of known structure, i.e., as horseradish peroxidase, zucchini ascorbate oxidase, soybean agglutinin, honeybee venom hyaluronidase, bovine ribonuclease B, and bovine fetuin. An electrophoretic band corresponding to 4 μg of glycoprotein was generally sufficient to allow detection of the major N-glycan species.

At the beginning of the last (5th) larval stadium, worker corpora allata synthesize less JH than queen corpora allata as a consequence of a limited production of JH precursors and a caste- and stage-specific block of the terminal step in JH biosynthesis. As previously shown, the Manduca sexta allatotropin stimulates JH biosynthesis in honey bee corpora allata in a dose-dependent and reversible manner, but can not overcome the stage-specific block in the terminal step of JH biosynthesis that is typical for worker early 5th instars. In experiments with M. sexta allatotropin and with the JH precursor farnesoic acid, we found characteristic stage-specific differences in their effects on JH biosynthesis. From the end of the spinning stage on, corpora allata could be stimulated by farnesoic acid to a much higher extent than in earlier developmental stages, suggesting a sudden increase in epoxidase activity. Manduca sexta allatotropin, however, stimulated corpora allata activity until the end of the spinning stage, at which time the corpora allata become suddenly insensitive. These data suggest that in worker larvae, important changes in the regulation of the terminal enzymatic steps in JH biosynthesis occur at the transition from the spinning stage to the prepupal stage. However, the analysis of in vitro activities of the involved enzymes, O-methyltransferase and methyl farnesoate epoxidase, remained inconclusive.

The extract induced partial inhibition of the PLA2 activity of venoms containing class I, II and III PLA2s. When tested against the purified toxins, it showed the highest efficacy against class II PLA2s from viperid venoms, being relatively ineffective against the class I PLA2 pseudexin. In addition, C. sylvestris extract significantly inhibited the myotoxic activity of four Bothrops crude venoms and nine purified myotoxic PLA2s, including Lys-49 and Asp-49 variants. The extract was able to inhibit the anticoagulant activity of several isolated PLA2s, with the exception of pseudexin. Moreover, it partially reduced the edema-inducing activity of B. moojeni and B. jararacussu venoms, as well as of myotoxins MjTX-II and BthTX-I. The extract also prolonged the survival time of mice injected with lethal doses of several snake venoms and neutralized the lethal effect induced by several purified PLA2 myotoxins. It is concluded that C. sylvestris constitutes a rich source of PLA2 inhibitors.

Since the deficiency of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) has been shown to be a characteristic of most cancer cells, this study was designed to test the hypothesis that the anti-carcinogenic activity of CAPE might be related to its ability to restore GJIC in tumorigenic GJIC-deficient cells (WB-ras2 cells). The results showed that CAPE restored GJIC, phosphorylation of connexin 43 (Cx43) and its normal localization on the plasma membrane in WB-ras2 cells after 3 days at 5 μg/ml concentration. Additionally, CAPE inhibited growth in soft agar and decreased the protein level of p21(ras). The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the anti-cancer mechanism of CAPE may be mediated by its ability to restore GJIC.

Mortality caused by P. l. larvae ranged from 25 to 55% depending on spore dose. Oral inoculation with APV caused 9% mortality, which was not additive to the mortality caused by P. l. larvae. P. l. larvae did not induce the activation of APV infection. The mortality caused by V. jacobsoni itself was 25%, and by mites transmitting APV, 55%.

A mathematical model of neuronal arborizations may be useful to extract basic parameters or organization rules, hence helping to achieve a better understanding of the underlying growth processes. We present a parsimonious statistical model, intended to describe the topological organization of neuritic arborizations with a minimal number of parameters. It is based on a probability of splitting which depends only on the centrifugal order of segments. We compare the predictions made by the model of several topological properties of neurones with the corresponding actual values measured on a sample of honeybee (olfactory) antennal lobe neurones grown in primary culture, described in a previous study. The comparison is performed for three populations of segments corresponding to three neuronal morphological types previously identified and described in this sample. We show that simple assumptions together with the knowledge of a very small number of parameters allow the topological reconstruction of representative (bi-dimensional) biological neurones. We discuss the biological significance (in terms of possible factors involved in the determinism of neuronal types) of both common properties and cell-type specific features, observed on the neurones and predicted by the model.

Three- dimensional reconstructions demonstrate that these strata project in parallel through the entire pedunculus and through the medial and vertical lobes. Immunostaining reveals clusters of immunoreactive cell bodies within the calyx cups and immunoreactive bundles of axons that line the inside of the calyx cup and lead to strata. Together, these features reveal that immunoreactive strata are composed of Kenyon cell axons rather than extrinsic elements, as suggested previously by some authors. Sorting amongst Kenyon cell axons into their appropriate strata already begins in the calyx before these axons enter the pedunculus. The three main concentric divisions of each calyx (the lip, collar, and basal ring) are divided further into immunoreactive and immunonegative zones. The lip neuropil is divided into two discrete zones, the collar neuropil is divided into five zones, and the basal ring neuropil is divided into four zones. Earlier studies proposed that the lip, collar, and basal ring are represented by three broad bands in the lobes: axons from adjacent Kenyon cell dendrites in the calyces are adjacent in the lobes even after their polar arrangements in the calyces have been transformed to rectilinear arrangements in the lobes. The universality of this arrangement is not supported by the present results. Although immunoreactive zones are found in all three calycal regions, immunoreactive strata in the lobes occur mainly in the two bands that were ascribed previously to the collar and the basal ring. In the lobes, immunoreactive strata are visited by the dendrites of efferent neurons that carry information from the mushroom bodies to other parts of the brain. Morphologically and chemically distinct subdivisions through the pedunculus and lobes of honey bees are comparable to longitudinal subdivisions demonstrated in the mushroom bodies of other insects, such as the cockroach Periplaneta americana. The functional and evolutionary significance of the results is discussed.

Six populations (236 individual bees) and 17 populations (664 colonies) were, respectively, analysed using eight microsatellite loci and DraI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI)-cytochrome oxidase II (COII) region. Microsatellite loci globally confirmed the southeastern European heritage of both subspecies (evolutionary branch C). However, A. m. ligustica mitochondrial DNA (mtdna) appeared to be a composite of the two European (M and C) lineages over most of the Italian peninsula, and only mitotypes from the African (A) lineage were found in A. m. sicula samples. This demonstrates a hybrid origin for both subspecies. For A. m. ligustica, the most widely exported subspecies, this hybrid origin has long been obscured by the fact that in the main area of queen production (from which most of the previous ligustica bee samples originated) the M mitochondrial lineage is absent, whereas it is present almost everywhere else in Italy. This presents a new view of the evolutionary history of European honeybees. For instance, the Iberian peninsula was considered as the unique refuge for the M branch during the quaternary ice periods. Our results show that the Apennine peninsula played a similar role. The differential distribution of nuclear and mitochondrial markers observed in Italy seems to be a general feature of introgressed honeybee populations. Presumably, it stems from the social nature of the species in which both genome compartments are differentially affected by the two (individual and colonial) reproduction levels.","Apis mellifera; Hybridization; Italy; Microsatellite; mtdna; Phylogeography",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033927785

It later switched host to the Western honeybee (A. mellifera) and has now become a serious pest of that bee worldwide. The studies reported here on genotypic, phenotypic and reproductive variation among V. jacobsoni infesting A. cerana throughout Asia demonstrate that V. jacobsoni is a complex of at least two different species. In a new classification V. jacobsoni is here redefined as encompassing nine haplotypes (mites with distinct mtDNA CO-I gene sequences) that infest A. cerana in the Malaysia-Indonesia region. Included is a Java haplotype, specimens of which were used to first describe V. jacobsoni at the beginning of this century. A new name, V. destructor n. sp., is given to six haplotypes that infest A. cerana on mainland Asia. Adult females of V. destructor are significantly larger and less spherical in shape than females of V. jacobsoni and they are also reproductively isolated from females of V. jacobsoni. The taxonomic positions of a further three unique haplotypes that infest A. cerana in the Philippines is uncertain and requires further study. Other studies reported here also show that only two of the 18 different haplotypes concealed within the complex of mites infesting A. cerana have become pests of A. mellifera worldwide. Both belong to V. destructor, and they are not V. jacobsoni. The most common is a Korea haplotype, so-called because it was also found parasitizing A. cerana in South Korea. It was identified on A. mellifera in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Less common is a Japan/Thailand haplotype, so-called because it was also found parasitizing A. cerana in Japan and Thailand. It was identified on A. mellifera in Japan, Thailand and the Americas.

During their stays at the pond the body surface temperature of water foragers was measured using contactless thermography. Irrespective of the ambient temperature (T(A)) which ranged from 13.6 to 27.2°C, the water carriers reached thoracic temperatures of 36-38.8°C (mean values of the measuring periods). The maximum thoracic value of an individual bee was 44.5°C. At higher T(A) (20.9-27.2°C) head and abdomen were only about 3°C and 2°C on the average higher than the surroundings, respectively. In the lower range of T(A) (13.6-16.6°C), however, the bees warmed their heads up to 29.2°C (13°C above T(A)) and the abdomen up to 23.3°C (7.1°C above T(A); mean values of the measuring periods). The head and abdomen were even provided independently of one another with heat from the thorax. At a higher T(A) only little heat came from the heated thorax into the abdomen, at a cooler T(A) (13.6-16.6°C) more heat reached the abdomen. In all probability, at a higher T(A) only a small amount of haemolymph was pumped from the thorax into the abdomen; the most warm blood probably circulated in the head-thorax area. The average duration of stays at the pond decreased linearly from 110 to 42 s with rising T(A). Head and thorax showed great fluctuations of temperature. For example, the head was heated by 4.6°C within 25 s, the thorax by 6.1°C within 30 s. Foragers drinking sucrose solution are known to increase their thoracic temperature with rising concentration of the sucrose solution. The water foragers had thoracic temperatures similar to that of bees feeding on 0.5 molar sucrose solution. It is hypothesized that the foraging motivation of both groups was similar and therefore they regulated their thoraces at the same temperature level.

Different parameters related to mouth-to-mouth food exchange (trophallaxis) showed important modulations as the offered flow of solution was incremented. Trophallactic transfer rate, i.e. the speed at which liquid food is transferred from donor to recipient bee, was found to increase along with increasing profitability at the rate feeder. In the present case, food source profitability could have been evaluated by foragers either by measuring the time invested in ingesting the solution, or by direct assessment of the flow rate of the feeder.

To investigate the structural and functional role of Pro14 a melittin analogue was studied where proline is substituted by an alanine residue (P14A). The investigations were focussed on: (i) the secondary structure in aqueous solution and membranes; (ii) the self-association in solution; (iii) the binding to POPC membranes; and (iv) the P14A-induced leakage and pore formation in membrane vesicles. Circular dichroism and gel filtration experiments showed that P14A exists at concentrations <12 μM in monomeric form with an α-helicity of 28±7%. A further increase in peptide concentration leads to the formation of large aggregates consisting of 9±1 monomers. While binding studies with POPC vesicles revealed for P14A a stronger binding affinity towards membranes than for melittin, the peptide-induced leakage of fluorescent markers from vesicles was less efficient for P14A than for melittin. Furthermore, an unexpected efflux behaviour at high values of bound P14A was observed which indicated that the pore formation kinetics for P14A is more complex than it was reported for melittin. The different features of P14A in aggregation, binding and efflux compared to melittin are mainly ascribable directly to structural changes caused by the proline→alanine substitution. Furthermore, the results indicate an improved screening of the positively charged residues of P14A by counterions which contributes additionally to the observed differences in peptide activities. It is suggested that the presence of proline in melittin is not only of structural importance but also influences indirectly the electrostatic properties of the native peptide.

Imidacloprid, a strong systemic compound, is effective against several sucking and mining pests. The acute toxicity of contact and oral applications on two Apis mellifera subspecies, Apis mellifera mellifera and Apis mellifera caucasica, was investigated. In all toxicological studies, each dose included three cages of 20 individuals and each study was replicated three times. The dose-mortality relation revealed some unusual characteristics. At low imidacloprid concentrations, a biphasic mortality appeared, particularly with the contact exposure route. At moderate doses, mortality profiles at 24 and 48 h were different only after oral application. Response kinetics showed that mortality was delayed at the higher doses of imidacloprid. After oral intoxication, the LD50 values of imidacloprid at 24 and 48 h were about 5 ng/bee for both A. m. mellifera and A. m. caucasica. After contact application, the LD50 values at 24 and 48 h were approximately 24 ng/bee for A. m. mellifera and 14 ng/bee for A. m. caucasica.

We examined the role of the vibration signal in the house-hunting process of seven honeybee swarms. The signal was perforated by a small proportion of the older bees, and 20% of the vibrating bees also performed waggle dances for nestsites. Compared to non-vibrating controls, vibrating bees exhibited increased rates of locomotion, were more likely to move into the interiors of the swarms, and were more likely to fly from the clusters and perform waggle dances. Recipients responded to the signal with increased locomotion and were more likely than non-vibrated controls to fly from the swarms. Because vibration signals were intermixed with waggle dances by some vibrators, and because they stimulated flight in recipients, the signals may have enhanced nestsite scouting and recruitment early in the house-hunting process. All swarms exhibited increased vibration activity within 0.5-1 h of departure. During these final periods, numerous vibrating bees wove repeatedly in and out of the clusters while signaling and motion on the swarms increased until it culminated in mass flight. The peaks of vibration activity observed at the end of the house-hunting process may therefore have activated the entire swarm for liftoff once a new nestsite had been selected. Thus, the vibration signal may help to integrate the behavior of numerous groups of workers during nestsite selection and colony relocation.","Honeybee; Modulatory communication; Swarming; Vibration signal; Waggle dance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033895225

We recorded peak waggle phase vibrations from 206 to 292 Hz (244 ± 28 Hz; mean ± S.D., N = 11). The maximum measured signal noise level was +12.4 dB during the waggle phase (mean +5.8 ± 2.7 dB). The maximum vibrational velocity, calculated from a filtered signal, was 128 μm s-1 peak-to-peak, corresponding to a displacement of 0.09 μm peak-to-peak at 223 Hz. On average, we measured a vibrational velocity of 79 ± 28 μms-1 peak-to-peak from filtered signals. These signal amplitudes overlap with the detection threshold of the honeybee subgenual organ.","Apis mellifera; Behaviour; Communication; Honeybee; Signal; Vibration; Waggle dance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034122303

Olfactory projection neurons arborize in the lip of the calyceal neuropil, whereas visual projection neurons project to the collar. To study the maturation of this pattern of innervation, as well as the development of uniglomerular projection neurons within the antennal lobes (als), we conducted the following three studies focused on the first four stages of pupal development: mass staining of olfactory projection neurons, single cell labeling of olfactory projection neurons, and simultaneous labeling of olfactory projection neurons and visual projection neurons. Examination of whole-mount preparations with the confocal laser scanning microscope revealed that the olfactory projection neurons achieved their adult arborization pattern within their main output region, the lip of the mb calyces, earlier during development (pupal stage 1) than their dendritic processes within their main input region, the al (pupal stage 2). Simultaneous labeling experiments showed further that the fiber terminals of olfactory projection neurons and visual projection neurons did not overlap but instead occupied their respective projection areas within the mb calyces as early as pupal stage 1. We conclude that selective innervation of different subregions of the calycal neuropil precedes the segregation of glomerular units within the antennal lobe neuropil, and that the Kenyon cells themselves provide a template for the innervation of olfactory and visual projection neurons.

The coupling of HTGC to mass spectrometry requires appropriate instrumentation in order to achieve sufficient sensitivity at high elution temperatures and avoid loss of chromatographic resolution. Chemical ionization was carried out using methane as reagent gas in order to determine the molecular mass of the individual compounds by means of abundant quasi molecular ions. To confirm the presence of unsaturated wax esters, ammonia was used as reagent gas. More than 80 lipid constituents were separated and characterized by their mass spectra.

Queens and queenless (QL) egg-laying workers possess a bouquet of esters and hydrocarbons, whereas queenright (QR) workers produce exclusively hydrocarbons. The effects of social environment (QR vs. QL conditions) and possible physiological constraints on the gland were studied by following the biosynthesis of these classes of compounds in vivo and in vitro. Biosynthesis in vivo followed the prediction based on glandular chemistry. Queens and QL egg-laying workers, but not QR workers or QL foragers, showed incorporation of sodium acetate into both hydrocarbons and esters. In contrast, the in vitro studies revealed that, in addition to queens and QL egg-laying workers, QR nurses retained their ability to produce the queen characteristic esters. Although there was some ester production in foragers, it occurred to a lesser extent. It is possible that the glands in the older foragers undergo irreversible changes. The in vitro incubation also revealed a temporal activation of ester biosynthesis in QR workers. In these glands alcohols, corresponding to the alcohol moiety of the esters, predominated in short-term incubations but decreased as the amount of newly synthesized esters increased. In contrast, queens and QL egg-laying workers showed predominant incorporation into esters from the onset of incubation. Thus, expression within the workers' Dufour's gland is regulated. In the presence of a queen, ester production is inhibited. Once the queen is removed the physiologically unconstrained gland starts to biosynthesize the queen- specific esters after a certain lag needed for the build-up of precursors and the enzymatic machinery.

The method consists of dusting adult bees with finely ground white sugar. The sugar dust is expected to adhere to the pads of the Varroa mite, rendering them unable to fasten to any substance. The mite should lose its grip and thus fall on the floor of the hive, where it dies. Similar sugar treatment was applied sequentially to 12 bee colonies at intervals of three, seven and 14 days in July 1996. The mite fall per day after treatment in all three sugar-treated groups was statistically highly significant in comparison with the levels before treatment, and with 12 control colonies. On the first sugar treatment (n=4) the mean mite fall per day in two sugar-treated groups was 56 (ratio 663:11.85 total mites) and 47 (ratio 298:6.37 total mites) fold compared with the levels before treatments. The sugar particle size was studied under scanning electron microscope. The most efficient size in adhering to the ambulacrum of the adult female mite was concluded to be <5μm. This method of controlling mites could be used throughout the year, especially during honey flow, when other methods are not allowed. The treatment may also help in detecting populations of mites that are resistant to chemicals. It is not likely that resistance will evolve in the mite to sugar dusting.","Dusting; Ecological; Finland; Non-chemical control; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034419956

Here we show that honeybees also possess an allocentric form of spatial memory which allows localization of multiple places relative to the intended goal, the hive. The egocentric route memory, which is called the specialized route memory (SRM) here, initially dominates navigation when an animal is first trained to a feeding site and then released at an unexpected site and this is why it is the only reference system detected so far in experiments with bees. However, the SRM can be replaced by an allocentric spatial memory called the general landscape memory (GLM). The GLM is directly accessible to the honeybee (and to the experimenter) if no SRM exists, for example, if bees were not trained along a route before testing. Under these conditions bees return to the hive from all directions around the hive at a speed comparable to that of an equally long flight along a trained route. The flexible use of the GLM indicates that bees may store relational information on places, connections between landmarks and the hive and/or views of landmarks from different directions and, thus, the GLM may have a graph structure, at least with respect to one goal, i.e. the hive.","Honeybee; Landmark orientation; Navigation; Spatial memory",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034701810

Thermoregulation in over-wintering clusters is thought to be the result of individual bees attempting to regulate their own body temperatures. At ambient temperatures above 0°C, a clustering bee will move relative to its neighbours so as to put its local temperature within some ideal range. The proposed model incorporates this behaviour into an algorithm for bee agents moving on a two-dimensional lattice. Heat transport on the lattice is modelled by a discrete diffusion process. Computer simulation of this model demonstrates qualitative behaviour which agrees with that of real honey bee clusters. In particular, we observe the formation of both disc- and ring-like cluster shapes. The simulation also suggests that at lower ambient temperatures, clusters do not always have a stable shape but can oscillate between insulating rings of different sizes and densities.

Three possible effects of the introduced honey bee were examined. Firstly, honey bee impact on the reproductive success of heather, an important weed species in Tongariro National Park, was examined. Insect visitation rates on heather flowers were low at each of four study sites within the park. Bagging plants to exclude insect flower visitors had little effect on the level of seed set. The potential of other pollen vectors, wind and thrips, as pollinators of heather was also examined. The studies indicate that none of these vectors significantly effect the amount of viable seed produced so it is concluded that heather is capable of autonomous self-pollination. The second part of the study examined the impact of honey bees on the pollination systems of a native plant species. Flax is thought to be predominantly bird pollinated, but the floral resources are also utilised by a variety of native and introduced insect species including honey bees. Fruit and seed set was found to be significantly higher at sites with bird visitation. The results also suggest, however, that flax has a flexible pollination system that enables it to maintain a range of fruit and seed set levels under different pollinator regimes. In the third study, competition between native flower visitors and honey bees was examined for two common alpine shrubs- manuka and Hebe stricta. The abundance and diversity of insect visitors varied considerably between sites, and between observational periods. Some of this variation may be ascribed to differences in the weather or to altitude. However, the abundance and diversity of diptera appeared to also be strongly negatively influenced by levels of honey bee activity. This indicates that honey bees do play a role in determining the structure of pollinator communities and may be a threat to local native biodiversity.","Apis mellifera; Calluna vulgaris; Displacement; Heather; Honey bees; Native plants; New Zealand; Pollination; Tongariro National Park",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034001404

The treatment with flumethrin led to increased GST activity in the larval instars, pupae and nurse bees compared with the control group. In particular, the late fifth larval instars (LS) and the pupal instars showed increased GST activities. GSH-Px[TBH] activities were highest in the early larval instars (L1-L2). Treatment with flumethrin resulted in the induction of GSH-Px[TBH] activity in the L4-L5 instars and LS. In the forager bees, the enzyme activity was lower in the group treated with flumethrin than in the control group. This could have been due to unknown extrinsic environmental factors. In general, the average protein contents were lower in the flumethrin-treated group than in the control group. In the LS and pupal stage, and in the adult worker bees, the differences were significantly lower. This inhibition of growth could be due to metabolic costs resulting from exposure to toxicants.","Apis mellifera; Bayvarol(R); Flumethrin; Glutathione peroxidase; Glutathione S-transferase",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034084311

Before discrimination can occur, the ability to fixate is promoted by any radial pattern irrespective of the number of symmetry axes. A ring of spots can also stabilize the eye before the positions of the spots are discriminated. Cues for discrimination are of two main types. First, with fixed patterns of sectors or spots, the cue is the location of an area of black relative to the fixation point, and the particular number of axes is less important than the size of the individual areas. Secondly, evidence is presented for a family of filters with large fields and coarse tuning that detect patterns of radially symmetrical edges. These filters become more evident when the patterns are made of thin black radial bars or when they are rotated at random during the training. An angular shift of one radial pattern relative to the other, or a difference between numbers of bars, is best discriminated when one of the patterns but not the other has angles of 30°, 60°, or 120°between radial edges, and least when the angles are 90°. Baffles in the apparatus make the bees pause and fixate so that discrimination is improved. When targets are rotated during the learning process, radial cues for discriminations must be presented as edges, not as spots or areas. Besides detecting and fixating flowers, this system could be useful to estimate the perfection of their symmetry.

Yet the means through which insects detect amino acids can be complex and arise from pre- and post- ingestive mechanisms. Furthermore, the response to an amino acid can change depending on an insect's nutritional status. Here we use a sensitive feeding assay and Proboscis Extension Response (PER) conditioning in the honey bee to assay the effect of glycine, which is a common constituent of nectars and pollens. Subjects preferred to feed on a sucrose stimulus that contained glycine, and the highest relative preference was recorded for the highest concentration of glycine. However, the highest response rate occurred at lower than maximal concentrations and differed depending on the physiological status of the subjects. These results are consistent with a model in which subjects attempt to maintain a physiological target amount of glycine/amino acid relative to other nutrients. All concentrations of glycine enhanced the rate and magnitude of a conditioned response to an odor in the PER assay, which demonstrates that animals can learn to modify their responses to an odor conditioned stimulus based on the presence of amino acid. This capability would enhance a honey bee's ability to evaluate the quality of floral nectars, which are associated with, among other things, odor cues given off by flowers. In future studies these techniques will allow us to evaluate the physiological roles that amino acids play in honey bee diet and choice behavior.

The temperature at which the final burst occurs for D. melanogaster (7.0±0.9°C) is significantly lower than that of A. mellifera workers (10.6±1.2°C), queens (10.2±0.8°C), and drones (12.8±0.8°C).

This is attributed to the lower rate of stigma contact in A. mellifera visits, rather than to insufficient deposition of compatible pollen when the stigmas are contacted. A. mellifera pollen collectors had very high rates of stigma contact, but they were very scarce (3%) on 'Delicious' flowers despite the presence of abundant brood in their hives. One single visit per flower by O. cornuta produced commercial fruit set (27.4%) and fruit size (>70 mm diameter).

It comprises detecting diseased brood in the larval and pupal stages and removing all such infected brood, thereby decreasing the incidence of infection. Hygienic behaviour consists of two task-components: uncapping cells and removing the cell contents. The aim of this study was to observe bees performing hygienic behaviour to determine their age at performance of the behaviour and to describe their behavioural repertoire. The bees performing hygienic behaviour were middle-aged bees, younger than foragers. In the colonies where the behaviours of individual bees were observed, all bees performing the hygienic behaviour were seen to exhibit both the components, though at different frequencies. One behavioural class performed the task of uncapping cells at higher frequencies than the task of removing cell contents, while another class performed both tasks to the same extent. While these two classes had higher frequencies of the tasks comprising the hygienic behaviour but lower frequencies of other common behaviours in their repertoire, a third class of bees included those that performed all behaviours in their repertoire at similar frequencies. There was no difference in the ages of the bees in these three behavioural classes. These results suggest that there is no evidence of task partitioning among bees performing the hygienic behaviour. The segregation observed could, however, be based on their response thresholds to the stimulus and/or on their ability to discriminate the various cues emanating from the dead brood.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034119516

During the first 50 flights the mean time taken to collect one portion of food decreased significantly and the number of visits to the artificial flower per flight increased significantly. During flights following the 50th flight, the mean time taken to collect one portion of food increased significantly and the number of visits to the artificial flower per flight decreased significantly.

To gain insights into mitochondrial function during flight, metabolic rates of individual flying honeybees were measured using respirometry, and their thoracic muscles were fixed for electron microscopy. Mitochondrial volume densities and cristae surface densities, combined with biochemical data concerning cytochrome content per unit mass, were used to estimate respiratory chain enzyme densities per unit cristae surface area. Despite the high content of respiratory enzymes per unit muscle mass, these are accommodated by abundant mitochondria and high cristae surface densities such that enzyme densities per unit cristae surface area are similar to those found in mammalian muscle and liver. These results support the idea that a unit area of mitochondrial inner membrane constitutes an invariant structural unit. Rates of O2 consumption per unit cristae surface area are much higher than those estimated in mammals as a consequence of higher enzyme turnover rates (electron transfer rates per enzyme molecule) during flight. Cytochrome c oxidase, in particular, operates close to its maximum catalytic capacity (k(cat)). Thus, high flux rates are achieved via (i) high respiratory enzyme content per unit muscle mass and (ii) the operation of these enzymes at high fractional velocities.","Apis mellifera; Complex III; Cytochrome; Electron flow; Flight; Honeybee; Metabolic rate; Mitochondria; Oxygen consumption; Respiratory chain enzyme; Respirometry",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034042206

The Italian colonies had queens imported directly from the USA, or from the Brazilian Island of Fernando de Noronha, where varroa-infested Italian colonies have been maintained, untreated, since 1984. Recently sealed worker brood cells were artificially infested by opening the cell capping, inserting live adult female mites and resealing the cells. Control cells were treated in the same way, but without introducing mites. The ability of the Africanized honey bees to recognize and remove this artificially infested brood was compared with that of first generation Italian/Africanized hybrid bees, and with the two groups of 'pure' Italian bees, in three separate experiments. Africanized colonies removed a mean of 51% of the infested brood, while Italian/Africanized hybrid colonies removed 25%.

In situ hybridization analysis revealed that the expression of these genes was also concentrated in the mushroom bodies of the honeybee brain: The CaMKII gene was expressed preferentially in the large-type Kenyon cells of the mushroom bodies, whereas that for PKC was expressed in both the large and small types of Kenyon cells. The expression of the genes for IP3R and CaMKII was concentrated in the mushroom bodies of the queen and drone as well as in those of the worker bee. Furthermore, the enzymatic activities of CaMKII and PKC were found to be higher in the mushroom bodies/central bodies than in the optic and antennal lobes of the worker bee brain. These results suggest that the function of the intracellular Ca2+ signal transduction is enhanced in Kenyon cells in comparison to other neuronal cell types in the honeybee brain.

DA levels were reduced pharmacologically using a single 10 μl injection of either α-methyl-DL-p-tyrosine (AMT; 250 μg or 500 μg) or α-methyl-DL-tryptophan (AMTP; 250 or 500 μg) into the haemolymph of the bee. In all cases, maximum depletion of DA was observed 3 h after treatment, but in bees treated with AMTP (250 or 500 μg) or with 250 μg AMT, DA levels returned to normal within 24 h of treatment. Neither AMT nor AMTP was selective for DA: both drugs also reduced serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) levels in the brain. However, AMTP was more effective than AMT at depleting 5HT, whereas for DA, the reverse was true. Depletion of DA levels, using 250 μg AMT, led to a dramatic decline in the levels of specific binding of [3H]SCH23390, defined in this study as binding in the presence of 5x10-6 M cis-(Z)-flupentixol (see Ref.). In contrast, naturally occurring diel fluctuations in DA levels, identified in the optic lobes of the brain, and changes in brain DA levels resulting from queenlessness, had no significant effect on the density of [3H]SCH23390-binding sites in the brain of the bee. Overall, these results indicate that under normal physiological conditions, there is no direct link in honey bees between changes in endogenous brain DA levels and the density of D1-like receptors labelled by [3H]SCH23390. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.","Circadian rhythm; Dopamine receptor; Ligand binding; Serotonin",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034645917

But biologists can more easily study what an animal learns than how it learns. For example, honeybees take repeated 'orientation' flights before becoming foragers at about three weeks of age. These flights are a prerequisite for successful homing. Little is known about these flights because orienting bees rapidly fly out of the range of human observation. Using harmonic radar, we show for the first time a striking ontogeny to honeybee orientation flights. With increased experience, bees hold trip duration constant but fly faster, so later trips cover a larger area than earlier trips. In addition, each flight is typically restricted to a narrow sector around the hive. Orientation flights provide honeybees with repeated opportunities to view the hive and landscape features from different viewpoints, suggesting that bees learn the local landscape in a progressive fashion. We also show that these changes in orientation flight are related to the number of previous flights taken instead of chronological age, suggesting a learning process adapted to changes in weather conditions, flower availability and the needs of bee colonies.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034598789

A stimulatory JH action has been described for the majority of species studied thus far. In some insects, however, Vg synthesis has been inhibited or unaffected by JH. The aim of this study was to re-examine the action of JH on Vg synthesis in Apis mellifera workers, since contrasting effects of this hormone were described. Newly emerged worker bees were treated with different doses of pyriproxyfen (PPN), a potent JH analogue. Vg and total protein were quantified in haemolymph samples of newly emerged up to 6-day-old worker bees. Protein synthesis activity of fat body cultured in vitro and ultrastructure of fat body cells were also examined. High doses (1.25, 2.5, 5 and 10 μg) of PPN inhibited the onset and accumulation of Vg in the haemolymph of young worker bees in a dose-dependent fashion. This inhibition was not a result of fat body cell degeneration or death, as illustrated by fat body cells ultrastructure analysis, but by impairing Vg synthesis, as demonstrated by in vitro culture of fat body cells. Low doses (0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 μg) neither affected the normal synthesis and secretion of Vg into the haemolymph nor caused an early onset of Vg in treated bees (which could be interpreted as a JH-activating effect), as shown by Vg quantification at 24-h intervals. The results suggest that a low JH titre in honey bee workers permits the onset and accumulation of Vg in haemolymph, whereas high JH levels turn off Vg synthesis.","Apis mellifera; Juvenile hormone; Pyriproxyfen; Vitellogenin",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033980929

The ability of crotapotin to affect the enzymatic activity of the sPLA2(s) have also been evaluated. Secretory PLA2(s) obtained from both snake (Naja naja, Naja mocambique mocambique, Crotalus adamanteus and Crotalus durissus terrificus) and bee (Apis mellifera) venoms as well as that from bovine pancreas were used in this study. Rat paw oedema was induced by a single subplantar injection of the sPLA2s (5-30 μg/paw) in absence and presence of either crotapotin (10-100 μg/paw) or heparin (50 U/paw). Paw volume was measured using a hydroplethysmometer. Phospholipase A2 from Naja naja, Naja mocambique mocambique, Apis mellifera venoms and the basic component of Crotalus durissus terrificus venom all induced dose-dependent rat paw oedema whereas those from Crotalus adamanteus venom and bovine pancreas were ineffective. Paw oedema induced by PLA2(s) from both Naja naja and Apis mellifera venoms was significantly (P&lt;0.05) inhibited by crotapotin (0.1-100 μg/site) whereas the Naja mocambique mocambique venom PLA2-induced oedema was significantly potentiated (P&lt;0.05) by this polypeptide (40 μg/site). On the other hand, heparin (50 U/paw) had no effect on the paw oedema induced by PLA2 from Naja naja and Apis mellifera venoms but significantly inhibited the Naja mocambique mocambique venom PLA2-induced oedema. The measurement of the in vitro phospholipasic activity revealed that crotapotin inhibited by 60-70% the enzymatic activities of PLA2(s) from Crotalus adamanteus, Naja mocambique mocambique, Apis mellifera venoms and bovine pancreas. Our results suggest that despite the great homology between the various types of sPLA2 they interact with crotapotin on cell surfaces in different ways leading to either inhibition or potentiation of the paw oedema by a mechanism unrelated to their enzymatic activities. Since heparin reduced paw oedema induced by PLA2 from Naja mocambique mocambique venom it is likely that this sPLA2 is similar to the novel heparin-sensitive PLA2 found in mast cells.

Five micrograms of melittin in 0.5 ml of saline was intradermally injected into the volar aspect of the forearm. Resultant pain was scored by a visual analogue scale (VAS), and skin temperature change was analyzed by means of a computer-assisted infrared thermography. Intradermal melittin temporarily produced severe pain, followed by a sustained increase in skin temperature. The skin temperature increase peaked in about 10 min and outlasted 1 h. Topical application of 10% lidocaine gel did not significantly suppress the melittin-induced pain, but markedly suppressed both the increase in the peak temperature and the area of temperature increase. In conclusion, 5 μg of melittin is sufficient to produce pain in humans and 10% lidocaine gel differentially decreases the melittin-induced axon reflex without any significant analgesic effect.

Within the 6 populations of the Near East distinguishable by morphometry, the bees of Massandaran in Iran occupy an important position due to their large size. Even sea-level bees exceed the size of the bees of the elevated region of Central Iran, which seems to contradict Bergmanns's rule. An extended study had revealed that this population, clearly belonging to the subspecies Apis mellifera meda, shows a very distinct size increase from the Caspian Sea to the northern slope of the Elbrus Mountains, rising to 2 200 m in elevation. A similar but less pronounced ecocline with a marked increase in size can be found reaching up from the Mediterranean coast to the elevated Central Iranian region. The general pattern within A. m. meda in the region along 36°N latitude thus generally confirms Bergmann's rule, thus providing a fine example of an ecoclinal structure. However, size differences between the extremes, i.e., the Mediterranean and the coast of the Caspian Sea remain marked, which indicates an additional genetic component linked to a different history of the populations. This might prove to be an interesting aspect, as the area covered by A. meda is suspected to have played a major role in the evolution of A. mellifera.","Apis mellifera meda; Ecocline; Morphometry",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0342749271

Uncapping, disappearance of the introduced mite and removal of the pupa were recorded in a total of manipulated 3,096 cells during three summer seasons. The hygienic response varied between Africanized and Carniolan colonies, but this difference was significant only in one year, during which Africanized honey bees removed a significantly greater proportion of Varroa mites than European honey bees. A high proportion of the mites disappeared from artificially infested brood cells without damage to the pupae. The opening of the cell and the removal of the bee brood are independent traits of a graded response by adult workers towards mite-infested brood cells. We found a higher between-colony variation in the reaction towards Varroa-infested brood of Africanized honey bees compared to Carniolans.

The concentrations of proline in the blood of glucose-fed or -injected bees finishing their exhaustive tethered flights on a roundabout were significantly reduced compared to bees that were fed and rested for one hour. This indicates some utilization of proline during flight metabolism. The levels of essential amino acids and of the sum of all amino acids except proline remained roughly constant, indicating that the decrease of proline did not result from a changed haemolymph volume. 14C-labelled proline was injected into bees either shortly before starting their flight or before a resting period of equal duration in an incubator at the same temperature. Bees that rested had incorporated more proline into thorax body protein, and less of the labelled substance was unrecovered ('missing') and considered to be respired or less probably defecated. If the entire amount of missing 14C-proline is regarded as exhaled, the oxidative breakdown of proline reached higher levels after flight than in rested bees. This is another hint that proline is utilized during flight. Usually the exhaled amount did not exceed 10 μg proline in half an hour of flight.

We also cloned a cDNA with the complete coding region of the Antennapedia gene from Apis. Comparison with Antp proteins from other insect species revealed several regions of homology. The expression patterns of the isolated Hox genes from Apis showed that the original expression patterns of Dfd, Scr, and Antp appear between late blastoderm and early germ band stage in a temporal and spatial sequence. Each of them shows up as a belt, spanning approximately two segment anlagen, Dfd in the anterior gnathal region, Scr in the posterior gnathal and anterior thoracic region, and Antp in the thoracic region. Following expansion of the Antp domain in the abdomen as a gradient towards the posterior, Ubx/abd-A expression appears laterally in the abdomen. During gastrulation and in the germ band stage the domains of strong expression do not overlap any more, but touch each other.

When colony reproduction is dependent and young queens are produced in excess, conflicts among queens are predicted to occur. Honey bee colonies reproduce dependently by swarming. The mother queen leaves with a 'prime swarm' before daughter queens reach adulthood. Several young queens are produced, and often fight to death after emergence. Surviving queen(s) inherit the established nest or a portion of workers which then depart in an 'afterswarm'. Honey bee queens show traits considered to be adaptations for fighting and conflict with other queens, such as early venom production and fast development. During fights one of the queens often releases rectal fluid. The function of this 'spraying' behaviour is unclear. Possible functions of spraying are to affect worker intervention in fights, to act as a chemical weapon, or to interrupt fights. We staged fights between 24 queen pairs to investigate the temporal pattern of behaviour in spraying and non-spraying fights. Spraying occurred in 67% of the fights, usually upon physical contact, and it resulted in at least temporary separation of the queens in 81% of the spraying fights. Spraying fights were characterized by a significantly lower proportion of time spent in escalated aggression than non-spraying fights and a significantly shorter first escalated bout. This provides quantitative evidence that spraying interrupts fights and suggests that its function is to provide a temporary respite to the spraying queen.","Apis; Colony founding; Conflict; Fighting behaviour; Honey bee; Pheromone",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034005167

Similarly, workers began foraging at younger ages and had shorter lifespans when they had been infested by V. jacobsoni as pupae. The decrease in foraging age and possibly lifespan caused by the pupal infestation was offset by the colony's pollen environment during brood rearing.

The lack of extensive secondary structure features or hydrophobic core is compensated by the presence of five disulfide bridges that stabilize both the protein scaffold and the binding loop segment. A detailed analysis of the protease binding loop conformation reveals that it is similar to those found in other canonical serine protease inhibitors. The AMCI-1 structure exhibits a common fold with a novel family of inhibitors from the intestinal parasitic worm Ascaris suum. The pH-induced conformational changes in the binding loop region observed in the Ascaris inhibitor ATI are absent in AMCI-1. Similar binding site sequences and structures strongly suggest that the lack of the conformational change can be attributed to a Glu → Gln substitution at the P1' position in AMCI-1, compared to ATI.

The region occurring only in the larger derivative consists of paracystalline material. The smaller mitochondrial derivative terminates anterior to the larger one. An extremely long centriolar adjunct is observed between the nucleus and the smaller mitochondrial derivative. This adjunct is compact, very electron dense and gradually tapers from base toward apex, finishing at the anterior extremity of the axonemal microtubules. In this flagellar region, there is only one accessory body present between the larger mitochondrial derivative and the axonem. Anteriorly, the tips of the axonemal microtubules are inserted in a well developed mass of granular appearance. This material surrounds the nuclear base, separating it from the anterior end of the larger mitochondrial derivative.

Translocation in this context is the exchange of the positions of two different colored or black areas. This paper investigates what cues the bees have learned in this task. The patterns, made from combinations of calibrated colored papers, are designed to explore the parts played by the blue and green receptors when the boundary between the two colors provides contrast to only one receptor type. Horizontal translocation is not discriminated without contrast to the green receptors, but up/down translocation can be discriminated whatever the contrast at the boundary. The trained bees were tested on the same patterns made with different papers that included extreme changes in contrast. The results show that discrimination of up/down translocation involves green receptors and also blue receptors. When bees discriminate a translocation that shows contrast to only one type of receptor, they do not use the apparent brightness or the direction of the contrast to that receptor type acting alone. Instead, they discriminate the locations of colored areas irrespective of intensity differences or directions of contrasts.

Half-hourly honey bee (Apis mellifera) pollen foraging on C. salvifolius varied significantly within and between days even though data were only collected on clear sunny days. We found that flower observations varied between flower patches of a very restricted area. We fitted a simple linear model to half-hourly pollen foraging and used the model to predict observed pollen release. For each day, we calculated the optimal time delay between pollen foraging and pollen release. For 9 out of 10 days the time delay was between 28 min and 60 min. The average pollen foraging was about 44 min time delayed compared to average hourly pollen release. Incorporating the time delay in the pollen foraging model to predict pollen release for each of the 10 days, we found a non-significant difference between observed and predicted hourly pollen release for all days. We therefore suggest that pollen foraging of honey bees is determined by the pollen availability and that monitoring of hourly pollen release in entomophilous flowers may be done through simple observations of pollinator foraging. © 2000 International Bee Research Association.","Apis mellifera; Cistus salvifolius; Honey bees; Pollen foraging; Pollen release; Portugal",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034550846

Heterozygous 'limao' bees had an almost normal ultrastructural organization of the ommatidia, but there were some alterations, including small vacuoles in the crystalline cones and a loss of pigment by primary pigmentary cells. In homozygous bees many ommatidia had very deformed crystalline cones and there were some bipartite rhabdoma. There was a reduction in the amount of pigment in the primary and secondary pigmentary cells and receptor cells (retinulae) of mutant eyes. However, the eyes of both heterozygous and homozygous queens had the same type of pigment granules. Certain membrane-limited structures containing pigment granules and electron-dense material appeared to be of lysosomal nature. Since these structures occurred in the retinular cells of mutant eyes, they were considered to be multivesicular bodies responsible for the reduction in rhabdom volume in the presence of light, as a type of adaptation to brightness. The reduction of pigment in the pigmentary and retinular cells and the morphological changes seen in the rhabdom of the ommatidia may originate visual deficiencies, which could explain the behavioral modifications reported for Apis mellifera queens with mutant eye color.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034019834

This study examined the interaction between pollen storage and the effects of an infestation by the mite, Varroa jacobsoni Oudemans, in colonies of the honey bee, Apis mellifera L. We manipulated the pollen storage and mite infestation levels of colonies, and measured pollen foraging and brood rearing. Increased pollen stores decreased both the number of pollen foragers and pollen load size, while initially at least foragers from colonies with moderate infestations carried smaller pollen loads than those from lightly infested colonies. Over the course of the experiment, all colonies significantly increased pollen-foraging rates and pollen consumption, which was presumably a seasonal effect. Lightly infested colonies exhibited a larger increase in pollen forager number than moderately infested colonies, suggesting that more intense mite infestations compromised forager recruitment. Brood production was not affected by the addition of pollen, but moderately infested colonies were rearing significantly less brood by the end of the experiment than lightly infested colonies. Furthermore, the efficiency with which colonies converted pollen to brood decreased as the pollen storage level decreased and the infestation level increased. The results of this study may indicate that honey bee colonies adaptively alter brood-production efficiency in response to parasitic infestations and seasonal changes.","Efficiency; Honey bee; Parasitism; Pollen foraging; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034047584

Dancing and trophallactic events were recorded for bees returning from a rate feeder that provided 50% weight on weight sucrose solution at a constant flow rate of 5 μl min-1. Bees that had danced immediately before their trophallactic contact had more recipients per trophallaxis compared with bees that did not dance before. Thus, besides information coded in dancing behavior, dance maneuvers could serve as a stimulus to increase attention of bees located on the dance floor to receive nectar. In addition, the number of bees receiving food during a trophallaxis showed a positive correlation with the probability of dancing immediately after contacting. The time from arrival at the hive to when the first or the subsequent contacts took place presented no correlation with the probability of dancing after trophallaxis. Also, the duration of a trophallaxis was positively correlated with the number of recipients per trophallaxis. These results suggest that returning foragers could receive information during a trophallactic contact with their hive mates that modify thresholds for dancing. Dance maneuvers and trophallactic contacts performed by foraging bees seem to be 'mutually' affected.","Apis mellifera; Dance behavior; Honey bee; Nectar foraging; Trophallaxis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034031722

Bees also produce propolis and Royal Jelly which can be harvested but their most important effect is one not immediately obvious as an economic product: that of pollination. Bee diseases are predominantly infectious and parasitic conditions accentuated by the close confinement in which they congregate, either in man-made hives or in colonies in a natural cavity. Treatment or at least control of some of these conditions can be attempted. In some cases natural bee behavioural traits limit the effect of the disease while in others, such as the notifiable disease American foulbrood, destruction of the colony is the only method of control. The mite Varroa jacobsoni can be controlled by the synthetic pyrethroids flumethrin and tau-fluvalinate.

We independently confirmed pln3 by demonstrating its effects on individual foraging behavior, as we did previously for QTLs pln1 and pln2 (Hunt et al. 1995). QTL pln2 is very robust in its effects on foraging behavior. In this study, pln2 was again shown to affect individual foraging behavior of workers derived from a hybrid backcross of the selected strains. In addition, pln2 was shown to affect the amount of pollen stored in combs of colonies derived from a wide cross of European and Africanized honeybees. This is noteworthy because it demonstrates that we can map QTLs for behavior in interstrain crosses derived from selective breeding and study their effects in unselected, natural populations. The results we present also demonstrate the repeatability of finding QTLs with measurable effects, even after outcrossing selected strains, suggesting that there is a relatively small subset of QTLs with major effects segregating in the population from which we selected our founding breeding populations. The different QTLs, pln1, pln2, and pln3, appear to have different effects, revealing the complex genetic architecture of honeybee foraging behavior.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034491828

In particular, discriminating individuals, such as guards at a nest entrance, should be less permissive to conspecifics when both the frequency of non-nest-mate contact and the cost of accepting non-nest mates is high. We tested these predictions by studying honey bee guarding during a period in which nectar conditions changed from dearth to abundance. Initially, during nectar dearth, individual guards accepted 80% of introduced nest mates and 25% of non-nest mates. As nectar conditions improved, both the intensity of robbing and guarding and the cost of non-nest-mate acceptance declined. In response, individual guards became more permissive to nest mates and non-nest mates until eventually an 'accept-all' threshold occurred - all nest mates and non-nest mates were accepted. These data are consistent with a shifting acceptance threshold and provide the first field data to support the model. A simple linear relationship occurred between the number of guards and the number of fights, 9:1, observed at the hive entrance, suggesting that guarding may be regulated by intruder intensity or otherwise regulated in an adaptive manner.","Acceptance thresholds; Conspecific recognition; Honey bees; Odor convergence",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034108980

None of the allatostatins tested affected JH biosynthesis during the last larval instar of honey bee workers. Manduca sexta allatotropin, however, stimulated JH biosynthesis in a stage-specific and dose-dependent manner. Analysis of intraglandular contents of juvenile hormone and its precursor revealed that the allatotropin significantly increased JH precursor but did not overcome the stage-specific block in the terminal step of JH biosynthesis that is typical for early fifth-instar worker larvae.

This is especially true with hybrid seeds which could be produced using the two genetic male-sterility systems available. For two years, we studied the effectiveness of honey bees as pollinators to produce hybrid seeds of globe artichoke under insect-proof enclosures. We used two adjacent 10 x 6 m tunnels covered with 1-mm mesh screen and planted with 2 male- fertile (MF) and 7 male-sterile (MS) lines (Tab. I). Each tunnel was provided with a colony of 3,500 bees at the onset of MF flowering. Flowering of MS and MF lines was well synchronized (Fig. 1), and the number of flower heads per plant was similar for all lines. Yet, there were over 10-fold differences in both years in the density of foragers that visited the various lines with extremes of 0.04 to 1.18 honey bees per head (Fig. 2). Some foragers collected pollen, but these were rarely seen on MS heads. The ranking of MS lines in terms of forager density was similar over both seasons, which suggests that the differences in attractiveness among these lines were of genetic origin and probably resulted from differences in nectar availability or composition. Yield of achenes per plant also varied significantly among lines (Fig. 3). The proportion of heads that were empty ranged from 23% to 100% among MS lines, and for each season was negatively correlated with the average forager density on each line (Fig. 4). The number of achenes per head in the flower heads which were not empty did not vary significantly among MS lines (Tab. II), which suggests that the pollination effectiveness of honey bee visits was similar among these different lines. This achene content was greater in MF heads, which is consistent with a greater pollination effectiveness of honey bees in this inflorescence due to the presence of pollen and some self-fertility in MF lines. The overall forager density was similar between the two seasons as was the proportion of empty MS heads, but the achene content of non-empty MS heads was significantly greater in the second year than in the first one (Tab. II). This suggests that the pollination effectiveness of individual visits was greater in the second year. Pollen availability was similar in both seasons, but there were 5 times fewer foragers collecting pollen in the second year compared to the first one. The pool of pollen is limited when producing hybrid seed, especially in confined environments, and our results suggest that in these situations the level of pollen collection may negatively affect the pollination activity of honey bee colonies.","Apis mellifera; Cynara scolymus; Foraging; Hybrid seeds; Pollination",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343920841

There was a positive correlation for these two traits, both for European and Africanized honey bees. The correlation was larger for Africanized bees, due to differences between Africanized and European bees, differences in experimental design, or both. Consistent with these results was the finding that colonies with a higher proportion of older bees were more defensive than colonies of the same size that had a lower proportion of older bees. There also was a positive correlation between rate of individual behavioral development and the intensity of colony flight activity, and a negative correlation between colony defensiveness and flight activity. This suggests that the relationship between temporal polyethism and colony defensiveness may vary with the manner in which foraging and defense duties are allocated among a colony's older workers.

In the present study we examined the effects of a glutamate transporter inhibitor, L-trans-2,4-pyrrolidine dicarboxylate (L-trans-2,4-PDC), on memory formation in the honeybee following a three-trial classical conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex (PER). Pre-training injections of the drug have no effect on acquisition and short-term (1 h) memory, but impair long-term (24 h), associative olfactory memory in a dose-dependent manner. This effect is transient and the amnesiac individuals can be re-trained successfully 48 h after injections. Our results suggest that glutamatergic neurons in the honeybee brain, in particular those found in the mushroom bodies (MBs), may be part of the circuitry involved in processing of long-term olfactory memory.

Differential discrimination abilities were observed between the two lines when healthy and diseased brood odors were used, with the bees from the hygienic line discriminating between the pair of brood odors better than the non-hygienic bees.

Using this behavioural paradigm we have developed a preparation in which the activity of a single antennal muscle has been operantly conditioned. This muscle, the fast flagellum flexor muscle, is innervated by an identified motoneuron whose action potentials correlate 1:1 with the muscle potentials. The activity of the fast flagellum flexor muscle was recorded extracellularly from the scapus of the antenna. The animal was rewarded with a drop of sucrose solution whenever the muscle activity exceeded a defined reward threshold. The reward threshold was one standard deviation above the mean spontaneous frequency prior to conditioning. After ten conditioning trials, the frequency of the muscle potentials had increased significantly compared to the spontaneous frequency. The conditioned changes of frequency were observed for 30 min after conditioning. No significant changes of the frequency were found in the yoke control group. The firing pattern of the muscle potentials did not change significantly after conditioning or feeding. Fixing the antennal joints reduces or abolishes associative operant conditioning. The conditioned changes of the frequency of muscle potentials in the freely moving antenna are directly comparable to the behavioural changes during operant conditioning.","Antennal system; Honey bee; Neural correlate of learning; Operant learning",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033884972

We investigated the effect of colony-level selection for pollen storage levels on the foraging behavior of individual honeybee foragers to determine (1) the relationship between genotype and phenotypic expression of foraging traits at the individual level and (2) how genetically based variation in worker task phenotype is integrated into colony task organization. We placed workers from lines selected at the colony level for high or low pollen stores together with hybrid workers into a common hive environment with controlled access to resources. Workers from the selected lines showed reciprocal variation in pollen and nectar collection. High-pollen-line foragers collected pollen preferentially, and low-pollen-line workers collected nectar, indicating that the two tasks covary genetically. Hybrid workers were not intermediate in phenotype, but instead showed directional dominance for nectar collection. We monitored the responses of workers from the selected strains to changes in internal (colony) and external (resource) stimulus levels for pollen foraging to measure the interaction between genotypic variation in foraging behavior and stimulus environment. Under low-stimulus conditions, the foraging group was over-represented by high-pollen-line workers. However, the evenness in distribution of the focal genetic groups increased as foraging stimuli increased. These data are consistent with a model where task choice is a consequence of genetically based response thresholds, and where genotypic diversity allows colony flexibility by providing a range of stimulus thresholds.","Division of labor; Honeybees; Pollen foraging; Selection; Task performance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033817546

Honey bees were selected as the model social insect because much is known about their natural history, physiology, genetics, and behavior. They are also inexpensive to procure and maintain. Of special interest is their use of communication and social organization. Methods: Using both between- and within-experiment designs, studies were conducted with harnessed foragers to determine whether honey bees would consume ethanol mixed with sucrose (and, in some cases, water). Shuttle-box and running-wheel studies were conducted to examine the effect of ethanol on locomotion. The effect of ethanol on stinging behavior in harnessed foragers was investigated. The effect of ethanol on Pavlovian conditioning of proboscis extension was also investigated. Finally, in a self-administration study, foraging honey bees were trained to fly to an artificial flower containing ethanol. Results: (1) Harnessed honey bees readily consume 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20% ethanol solutions; (2) 95% ethanol will also be consumed as long as the antennae do not make contact with the solution; (3) with the exception of 95% ethanol, consumption as measured by contact time or amount consumed does not differ in animals that consume 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20% ethanol solutions; (4) exposure to a lesser (or greater) concentration of ethanol does not influence consumption of a greater (or lesser) concentration; (5) consumption of 10% and 20% ethanol solutions decreases locomotion when tested in both a shuttle-box and running-wheel situation; (6) consumption of 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20% ethanol does not influence stinging behavior in harnessed foragers; (7) ethanol solutions greater than 5% significantly impair Pavlovian conditioning of proboscis extension; and (8) free-flying honey bee foragers will readily drink from an artificial flower containing 5% ethanol. Conclusions: The experiments on consumption, locomotion, and learning suggest that exposure to ethanol influences behavior of honey bees similar to that observed in experiments with analogous vertebrates. The honey bee model presents unique research opportunities regarding the influence of ethanol in the areas of language, social interaction, development, and learning. Although the behavioral results are interesting, similarity between the physiologic effects of ethanol on honey bees and vertebrates has not yet been determined.","Alcohol; Ethanol; Honey bees; Intoxication; Learning",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033844825

Worker-laid eggs are normally eaten by other workers in queenright colonies. Workers are thought to discriminate between queen-laid and worker-laid eggs by the presence or absence of a queen-produced egg-marking pheromone. This study compared the survival of three classes of eggs (worker-laid eggs from anarchistic colonies, worker-laid eggs from non-anarchistic queenless colonies, and queen-laid eggs) in both queen-right normal colonies and queenright anarchistic colonies, in order to test the hypothesis that anarchistic workers evade policing by laying more acceptable eggs. As expected, few worker-laid eggs from non-anarchistic colonies survived more than 2 h. In contrast, worker-laid eggs from anarchistic colonies had much greater accept-ability, which in some trials equalled the acceptability of queen-laid eggs. Anarchistic colonies were generally less discriminatory than normal queenright colonies towards worker-laid eggs, whether these originated from anarchistic colonies or normal queenless colonies. This indicates that the egg-removal aspect of the anarchistic syndrome involves both worker laying of eggs with greater acceptability and reduced discriminatory behaviour of policing workers.","Anarchy; Apis mellifera; Kin selection; Laying workers; Worker policing",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034091113

The expression of LI was also dependent on environmental factors that are most likely associated with age, foraging experience outside of the colony, or both. Furthermore, there was a correlated response in the speed at which progeny reversed a learned discrimination of 2 odors. These genetic analyses may reveal underlying mechanisms that these 2 learning paradigms have in common.

The 'queen substance', 9-keto-2(E)-decenoic acid (9-ODA), the dominant compound of the queen's mandibular gland pheromones, suppresses the secretion of queenlike mandibular gland pheromones in workers.

Using halved gelatin capsules, individual adults were confined opposite the intact cap that sealed vacant, isolated brood cells. From inside the cell, workers and drones of both species penetrated the drone-cell cap of A. mellifera with regularity. When placed outside the cell, workers of both species were successful in perforating the same cap. Similarly, A. c. indica workers easily perforated the cap of A. c. indica worker cells from inside. However, significant caste-specific differences in success at perforating the cap of A. c. indica drone cells were observed; whereas drones did so regularly, A. c. indica workers usually perished when so challenged. When held facing the cap while inside or outside the drone cell, none or only 10% of workers, respectively, managed to chew a hole in it. Even when two workers faced the same drone-cell cap, one from each side, only 20% of caps were perforated. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the tough apex of the drone cocoon of A. cerana is typically impervious to uncapping from outside, and hence has provided an opportunity for the uninterrupted reproduction of invading parasitic mites (Varroa spp.). The mandibles of drones of both species possess a diminutive apical tooth along the distal margins that is absent in workers. The lack of mandibular teeth in workers may explain the disparity in ability to penetrate the tough cocoon of A. c. indica drones. The mandibles of both castes suffer wear.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033936958

Ethanolic extracts of propolis (EEP) have been shown to inhibit the activity of a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase (Gtf) enzymes in solution. These enzymes synthesize glucans from sucrose, which are important for the formation of pathogenic dental plaque. In the present study, the effects of propolis from two different regions of Brazil on the activity of separate, purified Gtf enzymes in solution and on the surface of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sHA) beads were evaluated. The EEP from Minas Gerais (MG; Southeastern Brazil) and Rio Grande do Sul(RS; Southern Brazil) were tested for their ability to inhibit the enzymes GtfB (synthesis of insoluble glucan), GtfC (insoluble/soluble glucan) and GtfD (soluble glucan). The effects of propolis on Gtf from Streptococcus sanguis (soluble glucan synthesis) was also explored. The EEP from both regions effectively inhibited the activity of all Gtfs in solution (75-95%) and on the surface of sHA beads (45-95%) at concentrations between 0.75 and 3.0 mg of propolis/ml. However, the two samples of propolis showed different levels of inhibition on each of the enzymes tested. In general, EEP RS demonstrated a significantly higher inhibitory activity on GtfB and C activities (both solution and surface assays) than EEP MG at concentrations between 0.047 and 0.187 mg/ml (p<0.05). EEP MG, on the other hand, exhibited a greater inhibitory effect on the activities of surface GtfD (at 0.375, 0.75 and 1.5 mg/ml) and S. sanguis Gtf (at 1.5 and 3.0 mg/ml; p<0.05). These data indicate that EEP is a potent inhibitor of Gtf enzymes in solution and adsorbed on an experimental pellicle; however, its effect on Gtf activity is variable depending on the geographical origin of the propolis samples. There is a need to identify the active compounds of propolis. Copyright © 2000 S.

The hypopharyngeal gland, which is well developed in young nursing bees to produce protein for larval food, was seen to regress naturally in foraging adult worker bees. A range of techniques including histology, cytochemistry, in situ TUNEL, Annexin V and Comet assays indicated that cells within the gland demonstrate progressive symptoms of apoptosis, necrosis and a vacuolar form of programmed cell death. The latter mode of cell death did not display chromatin margination, but was accompanied by an enhanced level of autophagic and hydrolytic activity in which a cytosolic source of acid phosphatase became manifest in the extra-cisternal spaces. Normal and annexin-positive cells were found to occur in the younger nursing bees, whilst necrosis and an aberrant vacuolar type of apoptosis predominated in the older foraging bees. The relevance of these results to the classification of programmed cell death is discussed.

Since then, the number of recognised Apis species increased from four to nine, and data on reproductive isolation played a key role in this development. In this paper, we discuss the behavioural mating barriers (mating season, mating place, sexual signals, daily mating periods), copulatory barriers (size, genitalia, mating sign) and physiological barriers (sperm transfer, sperm storage) and postzygotic barriers (fertilisation, development, hybrids). Allopatric A. mellifera and allopatric populations of the other species had a uniform mating period during the afternoon hours. Sympatric honeybee species were separated mainly by different daily mating periods. The mating period differed between populations of the same species from different regions. The sequence of the mating periods, however, described from Sri Lanka, Thailand and Sabah (Borneo) followed the same pattern and showed a taxonomic and size correlation: the dwarf bees (A. andreniformis and/or Apis florea) occupied the first position shortly after noon. The next mating period was occupied by cavity-dwelling bees and at sunset, A. dorsata drones flew out for mating. In addition, in the honeybee species that have been studied, various non behavioural mating barriers have been demonstrated.","Apis; Genitalia; Hybrid; Mating behaviour; Reproductive isolation",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034117807

By considering different substance classes of waxes, discriminant function analyses revealed distinct subtypes of comb waxes and of cuticular waxes. It is shown that the aging of comb wax is in part a spontaneous physicochemical process due to differential volatilities of compound classes with different chain length ranges. On the other hand it is directly influenced by the bees by adding lipolytic enzymes to the comb wax.

However, disease signs have never been encountered during hive inspections of local colonies of the Asian honey bee, Apis cerana. To study the susceptibility of A. cerana larvae to AFB, various doses of P. I. larvae spores were added to larval food and disease development was monitored. Results showed that 1-day-old larvae were most susceptible, next were 2-day-old larvae, while 3-day-old larvae showed no signs of disease even when fed a large dose (4.5 × 104 spores/larva). The negative correlation between susceptibility and larval age was similar to that found for A. mellifera. Further, at the susceptible age, A. cerana larvae showed higher resistance than A. mellifera larvae when fed the same dose of spores. The dose of spores that would cause 95% mortality of A. mellifera larvae only led to 47.1 % mortality of A. cerana larvae of the same age. This resistance by A. cerana larvae apparently was not totally related to their innate immune capability. An important aspect contributing to the resistance of A. cerana was the fact that up to 82.2% of inoculated larvae were removed by adult workers before the capped stage. This adult hygienic behaviour effectively decreased the level of spore contamination inside the hive. In contrast, results showed that A. cerana pupae were more susceptible when vegetative cells of P. I. larvae were injected into the pupal haemocoel of both species of bees. © 2000 International Bee Research Association.","American foulbrood; Apis cerana; Apis mellifera; Hygienic behaviour; Paenibacillus larvae larvae; Resistance; Susceptibility; Taiwan",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034552532

Each time the sucrose flow rate was doubled, the metabolic rate increased by 18.2 ± 2.0% (14.7 μl CO2 min-1) and final crop load by 25.1 ± 2.4% (7.04 μl). The possibility that the heavier load carried by the bees caused the increase in the metabolic rate was analyzed in detail. It was found that, for the same weight in the crop, the metabolic rate increased with the increasing reward rate. Therefore, a factor other than the carried weight might account for this increase: a motivational drive, whose intensity may depend on the reward rate at the food source. Although at higher reward rates metabolic rate increased during the visit, at lower reward rates it remained constant, suggesting that the effect of the carried weight on the metabolic rate might be controlled by this motivational drive. The hypothesis that honeybees maximize individual efficiency by reducing their crop load loses support, as foraging costs are not determined by the carried weight. The functional meaning of the reduction in crop load would be to increase the informational exchange at the hive.","Crop load; Foraging; Honeybee; Metabolic rate; Motivational state",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034078391

Moreover, there is evidence that A. mellifera may not always be the most efficient pollinator. Introduction of A. mellifera into crops may be unnecessary, and even detrimental to non-Apis bee populations, which should be considered as an alternative for crop production improvement. Evaluating the pollination efficiency of non-Apis bees is one of the first steps in planning successful strategies for their conservation. In this study, we evaluated the pollination efficiency of Peponapis limitaris and A. mellifera in plots of Cucurbita moschata: pollen removal and deposition; pollinator visit frequency; and the pollinator visit-nectar production relationship. The results show P. limitaris to be the most efficient pollinator as: (1) both males and females remove and deposit almost four times as much pollen as A. mellifera; (2) they make significantly more floral visits than A. mellifera; and (3) their visit frequency shows a strong relationship to C. moschata nectar production during anthesis. Recommendations arising from this study are: (1) the introduction of A. mellifera be avoided in C. moschata crops; and (2) basic research be done on the biology of P. limitaris that contribute to its conservation and greater exploitation.","Apis mellifera; Mexico; Non-Apis bee conservation; Pollination efficiency; Yucatan",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034524537

Subsequent analysis of this variation, coupled with follow-up morphological and ecology-based studies, showed that V. jacobsoni was a species complex. Other work carried out as part of that study also showed that only two out of 18 genetically different mites within the complex have switched host to A. mellifera and become a pest of this bee worldwide. These two mites are not V. jacobsoni as has been assumed, but they belong to a group of mites that naturally infest specific populations of A. cerana on mainland Asia. These mites will soon be renamed as a new species.

Other compounds (1-hexanol. butyl acetate, iso-pentyl acetate, and 2-nonanol) acted in more than one behavioral context. Octyl acetate was the most effective compound in allowing bees to locate targets, but did not recruit or release flight behavior.

The pollination ecology of Ixia species can be divided into several distinct systems exploiting insects of four insect orders (Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera). Ixia atrandra, I. curta, I. lutea, I. maculata, I. metelerkampiae, and I. versicolor have salver-shaped, nectarless flowers, in bright colors contrasting with dark ""beetle marks"" and are pollinated exclusively by hopliine scarab beetles. Four Ixia species with narrowly tubular flowers, spreading tepals, and ample nectar are pollinated by long-proboscid flies (Moegistorhynchus longirostris and Philoliche species). Three additional species with tubular flowers, and modest nectar volumes, appear to be pollinated by the pieriid butterfly, Colias electo (Ixia orientalis), or by a combination of hopliine beetles and tabanid flies with short probosces (I. aurea, I. esterhuyseniae, I. tenuifolia). The remaining species are largely pollinated by anthophorine bees or Apis mellifera, but bee pollination comprises three discrete systems. Species pollinated by Anthophora and Pachymelus species (I. capillaris, I. latifolia, I. odorata, I. rapunculoides, I. thomasiae) have cup-shaped flowers that secrete nectar. Salver-shaped flowers of I. flexuosa secrete no nectar, but are pollinated by pollen-collecting Apis mellifera. Buzz pollination by Amegilla fallax in I. scillaris is associated with vertical floral presentation, nectarless flowers, unusual in having a short, closed perianth tube, short, stubby filaments, and anthers dehiscing incompletely from the base. Outgroup comparison suggests that the ancestral pollination system in Ixia is the one in which flowers are cup-shaped, produce nectar, and are pollinated by large anthophorine bees. Exaggeration of the perianth into an elongate tube containing ample nectar, or the closure of the perianth tube and absence of nectar, or the development of basal anther dehiscense must be regarded as specialized adaptations related to their derived pollination strategies.","Apidae; Hopliini; Iridaceae; Ixia; Nemestrinidae; Pollination biology; Tabanidae",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034496219

Data were obtained from measurements of the bees' hygienic behaviour towards V. destructor-infested cells and towards pin-killed sealed brood. The heritability for the hygienic behaviour towards V. destructor-infested brood cells was h2 = 0.18 (± 0.27) and h2 = 0.36 (± 0.30) for the hygienic behaviour towards dead brood cells. The repeatability was likewise higher for the pin-killed brood assay (W = 0.46) compared with the assay using living mites-infested brood cells (W = 0.24). The genetic correlation between the behavioural responses to either the mite-infested or pin-killed brood cells was calculated to be rg = 0.61 (± 0.51) and the phenotypic correlation to be rp = 0.11 (p = 0.28, n = 100). Since hygienic colonies demonstrate resistance to brood diseases such as American foulbrood and chalk-brood, it may be worthwhile to intensify the expression of the hygienic behaviour through selective breeding and thus strengthen these potential characteristics associated with resistance to V. destructor in honey bee stock.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034563521

First, restrained bees were subjected to a Pavlovian associative learning procedure, based on the conditioning of the proboscis extension response (PER), where a floral odour was paired with a sugar reward. We observed the orientation behaviour of conditioned and naive bees in a four-armed olfactometer with four contiguous fields either scented with the conditioning odour or unscented. Information transfer was clearly shown, conditioned bees orienting towards the conditioning odour, whilst naive bees shunned it. Second, the effect of passive olfactory exposures during the bees' development was assessed in two behavioural contexts: either orientation in the olfactometer or a PER conditioning procedure. Two exposure periods were applied: (1) the pupal stage (9 days before emergence); (2) the early adult stage (8 days after emergence). No effect of preimaginal exposure was recorded, but exposure during the early adult stage induced a higher choice frequency of the odour field in the olfactometer, and lower learning performance in the PER conditioning assay. These observations show that olfactory information gained during development can modify bees' later behaviour in different contexts: this is another instance of olfactory information transfer in bees. These results also suggest that nonassociative learning phenomena, taking place at a critical period during development, might be involved in the maturation of the bees' olfactory system, and in the organization of odour-mediated behaviours.

When animals are conditioned to one odorant (A) and then conditioned to a mixture of that odorant with a second (X), the ability to learn or express the association of X with reinforcement appears to be reduced relative to animals that were not preconditioned to A. A recent model of odor-based response patterns in the insect antennal lobe predicts that the strength of the blocking effect will be related to the perceptual similarity between the two odorants, i.e. greater similarity should increase the blocking effect. Here, we test that model in the honeybee Apis mellifera by first establishing a generalization matrix for three odorants and then testing for blocking between all possible combinations of them. We confirm earlier findings demonstrating the occurrence of the blocking effect in olfactory learning of compound stimuli. We show that the occurrence and the strength of the blocking effect depend on the odorants used in the experiment. In addition, we find very good agreement between our results and the model, and less agreement between our results and an alternative model recently proposed to explain the effect.","Apis mellifera; Blocking; Conditioning; Generalizat ion; Honeybee; Learning; Memory; Odour; Olfaction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033794497

The ages of the queens and the variation in their reproductive potential are important factors in the outcome of such events. Selection would favour colonies that requeen as quickly as possible to minimize the brood hiatus, therefore selecting for queens reared from older larvae. Conversely, reproductive potential (queen 'quality') is maximized by rearing queens from younger larvae. This potential trade-off was tested during two phases of queen replacement, namely queen rearing and polygyny reduction. Our results suggest that queen age is a significant element during both queen rearing and polygyny reduction, whereas queen quality, at least to the magnitude tested in this experiment, has little impact on the outcome of either process. The rate of queen replacement therefore appears to be an important factor in the honeybee life cycle, and further mechanisms of potential importance during this life history transition are discussed.

Previously, we showed that the major proteins synthesized in the hypopharyngeal gland of the worker change from brood food proteins to α-glucosidase at the single secretory cell level in parallel with this age polyethism [Kubo et al., J.

It was found that most of the older workers in the dequeened colony synthesized brood food proteins as did nurse bees. Furthermore, the percentage of workers that synthesized brood food proteins was maintained at 80-90% of the total workers for at least two months, as in a normal colony.

Prunus amygdalus Batsch] are self-incompatible requiring cross-pollination to produce a commercial crop. Within seven known pollen groups, they also display cross-incompatibility. Coincidence of bloom between compatible cultivars is essential for cross-pollination. Since almonds are pollinated primarily by honeybees [Apis mellifera L.], arranging pollinizers in close proximity to one another promotes maximum pollen transfer. Almonds are frequently subject to inclement weather during their February bloom period. Strong honeybee colonies are better able to forage during marginal weather conditions than are weak colonies. Honeybee management can encourage pollen foraging and placement of colonies can affect flight activity and ultimately nut-set. Weather permitting vigorous honeybee flight activity is the most important factor for setting a good crop. Temperature also affects anther dehiscence, pollen germination, and pollen tube growth. The sooner an almond flower is cross-pollinated after opening, the greater the chance of fertilization and nut-set. Optimizing all of these pollination factors is therefore essential to achieve maximum production in almond orchards.","Apis mellifera; Bloom; Honeybees; Pollen; Pollen compatibility; Pollinizer; Prunus amygdalus; Prunus dulcis",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033958148

Pollen foragers deposited their loads on the frame where most of the unsealed brood was, independent of the position of this frame within the hive.

These experiments showed that olfactory stimulation within the colony is insufficient to increase or decrease the foraging effort, but suggest that foragers must have direct contact with the brood and pollen area to regulate their foraging activity according to the conditions in the colony.

The purpose was to test the hypothesis that an artificial habitat would have fewer or less effective pollinator visits than natural vernal pools and that, as a result, the plants would have lower fecundity. The effect of differences in flowering phenology and plant size among pool types on pollinator visitation and seed set was also evaluated. The most frequent insect visitors to P. abramsii flowers were the Eurasian honey bee, Apis mellifera, two anthophorid bees, Exomalopsis nitens and E. torticornis, and three species of bee flies, of which Bombylius facialis was by far the most abundant. All species of insect visitors displayed density-dependent foraging on P. abramsii, with greater numbers of visits per unit area where flower density was greater. Nevertheless, visits per flower were negatively correlated with flower density. Flowering phenology of P. abramsii was delayed in most created compared to natural vernal pools, which affected the frequency by species of insect visitors to created compared with natural vernal pools. Peak flower densities were significantly lower in created than in natural vernal pools. The created pools had more visits per flower. Plants were smaller in created pools compared to natural pools, and seed production was positively correlated to plant size. Seed set in P. abramsii was greater than one per plant in both created and natural pools but was significantly lower in created vernal pools. Most of this difference could be attributed to the larger size of plants in the natural pools. We conclude that pollinator limitation should not preclude the sparser populations of smaller plants in the created pools from having a positive growth rate. Subsequent establishment and persistence of populations in a majority of created basins on this site confirms this assertion.","Apis mellifera; Bombylius facialis; Density dependence; Endangered; Exomalopsis spp.; Flowering phenology; Insect visitation; Pogogyne abramsii; Pollination; San Diego County; Seed set; Vernal pool",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033922045

Infestation levels in control cells were the same as in the surrounding cells. In contrast to infestation of these individually raised cells, Varroa mites invaded worker larvae in raised cells along the perimeter of a patch of raised cells (10 by 21 rows) 2.5 times more often than surrounding unraised cells, and similarly ca. 2.5 times more often than in the remaining raised cells (interior) of this patch. In similarly prepared frames of drone comb, Varroa mites invaded individually raised drone cells 3.3-fold more often than the adjacent surrounding cells and control cells. On the other hand, Varroa mites infested drone larvae in the interior of the raised-patch area as often as drones in raised cells along the perimeter of the raised-patch, and this rate was ca. 2.5-fold higher than for drone larvae in unraised cells surrounding the raised-patch and drone larvae in control cells. The higher levels of infestation of raised cells did not come at the expense of the surrounding cells, i.e., the infestation levels of the adjacent surrounding cells were the same as in control cells. For worker larvae, the increased number of mites invading individual raised cells and edge cells of the raised patch were proportional to the number of surrounding nonraised cells. The relationship between raised cell-edges, observations of mite walking behavior on comb surfaces, and larval-to-cell-rim distances are discussed in relation to their possible roles in eliciting mite invasion of honey bee larval cells and contrasted to the putative role of kairomones in larval-host location.","Apis mellifera; Mite behavior; Mite prevalence; Parasite load scores; Raised cells; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034042683

P. l. larvae spores in various known numbers (3–1384 spores per larva) were inoculated at a larval age of 24–28 h. The in vitro study suggested that survival time decreased with increasing spore inoculation dose. No larvae inoculated with three spores died before day 6, but 30% of the larvae inoculated with 1384 spores had died at day 4, 36 h before the time of capping (in a bee colony). On day 4, approximately 480 000 bacterial colonies were cultured per larvae inoculated with 1384 spores at a larval age of 24 h. Viable counts of P. l. larvae per larvae from inoculation and four weeks onwards fitted (R2 = 0.917) a standard model for bacterial growth: lny = b ln (1+ exp (a—rt)), where y is predicted viable count, r is growth rate, t is larval age in hours, and b and a are constants. Bacterial growth rate in the four weeks infection period was estimated to be r = 0.179±0.030 h−1. In the queen-less micro colonies and full-size colonies the first signs of AFB were not visible to human eyes until day 4. By day 3 nurse bees removed 40% and 50 % of the inoculated larvae, respectively, indicating that they are able to detect infected larvae before disease symptoms are visible. An early removal behaviour probably is a very important trait to focus on when breeding for resistance against AFB. The removal behaviour of nurse bees in micro colonies was well correlated with removal in full—size colonies. We conclude that, the micro colonies may serve as a labour and time saving model for full—size colonies when testing the removal behaviour of selected bee lines. © 2000 International Bee Research Association.","American foulbrood; Apis mellifera; Early symptoms; Honey bees; Hygienic behavior; In vitro rearing; Infection progress; Paenibacillus larvae larvae; Removal behavior",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034415455

Its flowering phenology corresponds to the sub-annual frequency class of Newstrom et al., with a major burst in November. Flowers lasted for 3 to 4 days and produced abundant hexose-dominant nectar with its chemical composition and concentration (ca. 22%) constant across all flowering stages. Most of the total nectar was secreted by buds. When the flowers first opened, most (> 50%) of the total nectar was available to pollinators. As flowers faded, a resorption period began. The overall sugar production was not affected by nectar removal. Hand crosses showed that this species is self-compatible. Crossed fruits showed significant differences from hand-selfed ones (autogamy and geitonogamy). Xenogamous fruits and seeds showed the highest values for many traits (fruit mass, total seeds per fruit mass, mean seed mass, and seed germination percentage). Approximately 6% of the flowers set seeds in natural populations. Hymenopterans (carpenter bees and honeybees) and hummingbirds (four species) assiduously visited the trees in all the areas sampled and can be assumed pollinators. Almost 93% of recorded flowers were visited by bees, with the rest visited by hummingbirds. Phylogenetically, this species was included in the basal clade for the genus and characterized as passerine/hummingbird pollinated. However, we found that not only birds but bees functioned as major pollinators. This observation may indicate that this basal clade may represent an intermediate step from entomophily (typical of tribe Phaseoleae) to ornithophily (typical of Erythrina).","Breeding system; Erythrina; Fabaceae; Flower visitors; Nectar features; Nectary",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033949005

Morphocluster definition was consistent with mtDNA cluster membership but not with flight dimensional data. When all three character suites are combined, six different kinds of unrelated mountain bees are obtained. The only commonality among the mountain bees is that they are larger than those of lower altitudes.

Both haplotypes were found across and within several geographic regions, a result consistent with a single introduction into the United States. However, a broad survey of 151 beetles from their new range revealed significant heterogeneity in haplotype frequencies, perhaps resulting from multiple introductions.

For all plants the spectrum of visitors is similar. However the role of insects species in pollination is different and depends on the stamen and stigma length, flexibility of pedicle and feeding behaviour of insect inside flower. The possibility to take and to transport pollen grains usually increase with the size of insect. The nature of this correlation is determined by stamen and stigma length. Pollinators of G. palustre with short stamens and stigmas are smaller than those of Ch. angustifolium and G. pratense. On the other hand, more flexible pedicles of G. palustre prevent the flowers from visits of big insects. Three plants studied by the authors are not equally attactive for different insect groups. Dense inflorescence of Ch. angustifolium and G. pratense that usually are lifter under the grass are very attractive for foraging social insects (honey bee, bumblebee). Flies avoid long distance travelling and prefer single flowers located not far from each other. For instance G. palustre is more attractive for flies not for social bees. It is pollinated mainly by flies and solitary bees with average weight of 10-70 mg. The main pollinators of Ch. angustifolium and G. pratense are honey bees, bumblebees and wasps with average mass exceeding 70 mg.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042724595

The regulation of JH biosynthesis by neuropeptides and biogenie amines, as well as the transport of JH by specific binding proteins is now well understood. In contrast, comprehending its mode of action on target organs is still hampered by the difficulties in isolating specific receptors. In concert with ecdysteroids, JH orchestrates molting and metamorphosis, and its modulatory function in molting processes has gained it the attribute ""status quo"" hormone. Whereas the metamorphic role of JH appears to have been widely conserved, its role in reproduction has been subject to many modifications. In many species, JH stimulates vitellogenin synthesis and uptake. In mosquitoes, however, this function has been transferred to ecdysteroids, and JH primes the ecdysteroid response of developing follicles. As reproduction includes a variety of specific behaviors, including migration and diapause, JH has come to function as a master regulator in insect reproduction. The peak of pleiotropy was definitely reached in insects exhibiting facultative polymorphisms. In wing-dimorphic crickets, differential activation of JH esterase determines wing length. The evolution of sociality in Isoptera and Hymenoptera has also extensively relied on JH. In primitively social wasps and bumble bees, JH integrates dominance position with reproductive status. In highly social insects, such as the honey bee. JH has lost its gonadotropic role and now regulates division of labor in the worker caste. Its metamorphic role has been extensively explored in the morphological differentiation of queens and workers, and in the generation of worker polymorphism, such as observed in ants.","Corpora allata; Honey bee; Insect reproduction; Juvenile hormone; Metamorphosis; Polymorphism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034132093

Ovaries of the mites were dissected and stained with toluidine blue. The coloration of the terminal oocyte indicates the uptake of euplasmatic and/or yolk material and, therefore, the initiation of the reproductive phase. In phoretic mites from adult bees, no staining of the ovary could be detected. V. jacobsoni females artificially introduced into freshly capped brood cells and removed for dissection 6 h later already showed clear blue staining of the terminal oocyte. The ovaries of V. jacobsoni females introduced 14 h after capping of the brood cell, however, remained uncolored after incubation in toluidine blue. We conclude that, in phoretic mites, oogenesis is arrested at a previtellogenic phase. Immediately after invasion of the brood cell, reproduction is activated by an as yet unknown host factor. This factor is present in freshly capped brood cells but not in brood cells 14 h after capping. Our new method offers new possibilities for the exact determination of oocyte growth and, therefore, for the study of V. jacobsoni fertility in different host and parasite populations.","Fertility; Host-parasite relationship; Oogenesis; Reproduction; Varroa jacobsoni; Vitellogenesis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033782546

The theory of electrostatically mediated pollen transfer between insect pollinators and the flowers they visit is described, including recent studies which confirmed that the accumulated charges on airborne honey bees are sufficient for non-contact pollen detachment by electrostatic forces (i.e., electrostatic pollination). The most important morphological features in flower adaptiveness to electrostatic pollination were determined by means of two theoretical models of a flower exposed to an approaching charged cloud of pollen; they are style length and flower opening. Supplementary pollination by using electrostatic techniques is reported, and its possible importance in modern agriculture is discussed.","Electric charges; Electrodeposition; Electrostatic pollination; Electrostatic powder coating; Flower morphology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033922162

In honeybee larvae exposed to Amitraz, which demonstrates both necrosis and apoptosis, cell death was found in 82% of midgut columnar and in 50% of regenerative epithelial cells, 24 h after treatment. Cell death reduced to 36% in the epithelial cells, 48 h after treatment. In Oxytetracycline-treated larvae, cell death was identified in 40% of midgut epithelial cells, 24 h after inoculation and increased to 55% over the next 24 h. In.

This study also shows that the acaricide Amitraz is a trigger for programmed cell death in the midgut epithelial cells of honeybee larvae, unlike Paenibacillus which induces, necrosis only.

Durio has been reported to be pollinated by bats in Peninsular Malaysia. However, my observations of flower visitors and pollination experiments indicated that two species, D. grandiflorus and D. oblongus, were pollinated by spiderhunters (Nectariniidae) and that the other species, D. kutejensis, was pollinated by giant honey bees and bats as well as birds. Hand-pollination experiments showed that all three species were obligate outbreeders. A resource limitation in fruit production was suggested. The former two species were visited only by spiderhunters, and the bagged flowers that were opened for animal visitors only at night bore no fruit, while those that were opened only during the day bore fruits, at comparable fruiting ratios to open pollination. Durio kutejensis was observed to be visited by giant honey bees, birds, and bats at different times of day, and three series of bagged experiments that exposed the flowers to animal visitors at different times of day bore fruits at a comparable ratio to open-pollination.","Bat; Bombacaceae; Durio; Giant honey bees; Peak flowering period; Pollination; Spiderhunters",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033840571

Thus, inadequate cross-pollination frequently limits almond yield. We evaluated the effect of pollen dispensers (inserts), fixed onto honey bee hives, on almond fruit set and yield in orchards differing in planting design, i.e. varying in the arrangement and proximity of the main cultivar and pollinizers. Pollen dispensers did not increase fruit-set percentage and yield in the 1: 1: 1 planting design in which (a), pollinizer rows were planted on either side of the main cultivar rows; and (b), bloom overlap was good between the pollinizers (cv. Carmel and Monterey) and the main cultivar Nonpareil. In contrast, pollen dispensers increased fruit-set percentage and yield in the 1: 2: 1 (one pollinizer row: two Nonpareil rows: one pollinizer row) planting design in which the branches of the two Nonpareil rows facing each other were more distant from effective pollinizers, and bloom overlap between Nonpareil and one of its pollinizers (Mission) was suboptimal. The increase in fruit set and yield, attributable to the use of pollen dispensers occurred primarily on Nonpareil branches facing the adjacent Nonpareil row. The impact of pollen dispensers was significant at 50 m but not at 150 m from the hive.

Commercial bumble bee colonies were used to deliver the biocontrol agent in 1994 and 1995 and five-frame nuclear honey bee hives were used in 1995- 1997. Each honey bee exiting the hive carried about 1 x 105 colony-forming units of T. harzianum, with the majority found on the bee's legs (58%). Flowers collected from the bee-delivered treatment generally had half the density of T. harzianum as those from the sprayed treatment. However, during the 4 years of this study, T. harzianum delivered by bumble bees or honey bees provided better Botrytis control than that applied as a spray. In addition, the bee-delivered T. harzianum provided the same or a better level of control of Botrytis as commercial fungicides applied at bloom. Strawberries collected from the bee-visited treatments averaged 22% more seeds and weighed between 26 and 40% more than berries in nonvisited treatments. The number of seeds per berry and berry weight were reduced by 7-12% in plots treated with fungicides and visited by bees, indicating that the use of some commercial fungicides at bloom may impact pollination and yield. Bee delivery of T. harzianum 1295-22 is a viable option for strawberry growers interested in controlling Botrytis with minimal fungicide use.

Bees then fly directly to the food source. However an alternative hypothesis expounded by Adrian Wenner is that these bees search only for odour plumes. My hypothesis is that the dance contains information about the ecological reality in which bees exist which has hitherto not been recognized and which is utilized by bees to maximize their foraging success. If a new, desirable source of food appears, other new locations of the same source are more than likely to soon appear. Some bees that follow the dance may use the distance and direction information to avoid the known location, in order to search in other directions for new locations of the new food source which they will find by following odour plumes. The colony can thus most quickly both exploit the known location and, find and exploit new locations of the same food.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034342112

Mean lethal time increased significantly between a 1995 survey (24.9 ± 1.9 min) with a reference strain of the mite, and a 1998 survey with strains of mites from three regions of France (57.6 ± 3.5, 45.5 ± 3.8, 37.8 ± 3.8 min). These differences suggest that the efficacy of amitraz has decreased. © 2000 International Bee Research Association.","Acaricides; Amitraz; Apis mellifera; Control methods; Formamidine; Mean lethal time; Resistance; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034551009

Virtually nothing is known about the underlying neurophysiological processes that direct individuals into specific behavioral roles. We demonstrate that sensory-physiological variation in the perception of sucrose in honeybees measured when they are 1 week old correlates with their foraging behavior 2-3 weeks later. Workers with the lowest response thresholds became water foragers, followed with increasing response thresholds by pollen foragers, nectar foragers, bees collecting both pollen and nectar, and finally those returning to the colony empty (water<pollen<nectar<both<empty). Sucrose concentrations of nectar loads were positively correlated with response thresholds measured on 1-week-old bees. These results demonstrated how the variable response thresholds of a sensory-physiological process, the perception of sucrose, is causally linked to the division of labor of foraging.","Behavior; Foraging; Honeybee; Neuroethology; Response thresholds",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034032388

These compounds are being extensively tested for control of forest-feeding lepidopterous insects in North America; optical brighteners may thus become a common ingredient in commercial baculovirus formulations in the near future. Many flower species use UV signals to attract insects and to direct them to the nectaries. We examined a possible consequence of field applications of optical brighteners: their effects on the ability of pollinators to find and handle flowers. In field studies carried out in Mexico and the United Kingdom on three different flower species, application of dilute (0.1% or 1%) concentrations of the optical brightener Tinopal CBS reduced recruitment of bees to flowers. Bees that approached flowers were less likely to land and feed on flowers treated with Tinopal than on controls. On one plant species, Trifolium repens, the time taken for bees to handle inflorescences was longer following applications of Tinopal. It seems that this optical brightener may both reduce recruitment of insects to flowers and interfere with their ability to locate rewards. Field-scale applications could reduce pollination of crops, weeds, and wildflowers and adversely affect bee populations. These possibilities should be examined in more detail before widespread applications of these compounds to the environment are made.

Double-sensitized patients have either distinct antibodies for each venom or cross-reacting antibodies that recognize similar or identical epitopes in both venoms. Unfortunately, patients often fail to identify the stinging insect which makes it difficult to distinguish cross-reactors from non cross-reactors. However, for economic reasons as well as for the benefit of the patients, it would be useful to identify complete cross-reactors. Methods: In this study we investigated 24 double-sensitized patients who were candidates for venom immunotherapy. Homologous and heterologous FEIA inhibition was carried out with honeybee (Apis mel-lifera) and wasp venom (Vespula spp.) preparations from two different providers. The inhibitor concentrations were ranging from 0 to 100 μg protein/ml. Results: Sera of 4 patients were completely cross-reacting for one venom (3 honeybee, 1 wasp), 8 patients were partially cross-reacting and 10 patients were not cross-reacting. Two patients were excluded from the study due to insufficient homologous inhibition. Data from specific IgE measurements, skin test, and clinical history were not useful for the identification of cross-reacting patients. Conclusion: FEIA inhibition is easy to perform and useful for the identification of patients with complete cross-reactivity. In these patients immunotherapy might be restricted to one venom which is beneficial for the patient and cost-effective. Copyright (C) 2000 S.

Almost all of the electrophysiological components of photoreceptors known up to date, e.g. the phototransduction cascade, the ion channels of the membrane, phototransduction gain and optical adaptation mechanisms, are adequately described by simple biophysical and biochemical models. The connections of these components were tried out in synthetic simulations for best fits of simulated to intra-cellularly recorded membrane potentials. Although the parameters of the best model were determined exclusively for the measured membrane potentials of dark-adapted photoreceptors, the model also accurately describes the light-adapted photoreceptor membrane potentials. Furthermore, the model correctly predicts the time-courses of measured photoreceptor responses with respect to squared-modulated flicker lights up to 200 Hz. This clearly demonstrates that the presented photoreceptor model is indeed a physiologically adequate description of the essential components of the phototransduction and the electrical membrane processes in the photoreceptors of the honeybee worker.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034134231

To study behavioral development in the absence of JH we removed its glandular source, the corpora allata, in 1- day-old adult bees. The age at onset of foraging for allatectomized bees in typical colonies was significantly older compared with that of sham-operated bees in 3 out of 4 colonies; this delay was eliminated by hormone replacement in 3 out of 3 colonies. To determine the effects of corpora allata removal on sensitivity to changes in conditions that influence the rate of behavioral development, we used 'single-cohort' colonies (composed of only young bees) in which some colony members initiate foraging precociously. The age at onset of foraging for allatectomized bees was significantly older compared with that of sham-operated bees in 2 out of 3 colonies, and this delay was eliminated by hormone replacement. Allatectomized bees initiated foraging at significantly younger ages in single-cohort colonies than in typical colonies. These results demonstrate that JH influences the pace of behavioral development in honey bees, but is not essential for either foraging or altering behavioral development in response to changes in conditions.

We modified the visual panorama of an intertidal flat, using conspicuous movable objects, and conducted homing trials with the local population of swimming crabs.

In the second set of trials we moved all the artificial landmarks surrounding a crab's den 5 m away and then displaced the crab itself. The crabs made initial navigational errors in accordance with the new position of the landmarks; this shows that they oriented themselves by remembering the landmarks. We then repositioned the landmarks and released the crabs far from the familiar area, on a similar flat. This time the crabs could rely only on the artificial landmarks; they used this information and reached the point where home should have been according to the landmarks.

However, the effects of bee venom on apical membrane transporters of renal proximal tubular cells are not yet known. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of dried bee venom of Apis mellifera and its melittin on apical transporter activity of primary cultured rabbit kidney proximal tubule cells. Bee venom (1 μg/ml) decreased the cell viability and increased lactate dehydrogenase activity over 30-min treatments. Its effect was blocked by mepacrine or AACOCF3 (10-6 M; phospholipase A2 inhibitors). However, there was no effect on cell viability at a concentration of 0.01 μg/ml of bee venom. Thus, we investigated the effect of bee venom (1 μg/ml) on the activity of renal transporters at 30 min. Bee venom inhibited α-methyl-D-glucopyranoside, Pi, and Na+ uptakes, but increased Ca2+ uptake. These effects of bee venom were blocked by mepacrine or AACOCF3 (10-6 M), and bee venom-induced stimulation of Ca2+ uptake was also blocked by methoxyverapamil and nifedipine (L-type calcium channel blockers). In addition, bee venom increased [3H]-arachidonic acid release by 216% of that of control. In all experiments, bee venom melittin (0.5 μg/ml) had an identical effect to that of bee venom itself.

Mimulus nudatus and Mimulus guttatus are two closely related species that are isolated by a postzygotic barrier operating at the seed provisioning stage. On several sites on the serpentine soils of Lake and Napa counties, California, M. nudatus and M. guttatus live in sympatry and flowering times of the species overlap, so the species are sometimes flowering next to each other. We investigated whether there was any reduction in fertility of M. nudatus and M. guttatus caused by interspecific crosses when growing in sympatry. The pollinators of M. nudatus and M. guttatus were identified. Small sweat bees, Dialictus sp., preferentially visited the smaller flowered M. nudatus species and honey bees, Apis mellifera, preferred the larger flowered M. guttatus. In spite of most pollinator visits being intra-specific, individuals of both bee species made transitions between the Mimulus species. This will result in greater pollen transfer from M. guttatus to M. nudatus than vice versa becausc firstly, M. guttatus produces more pollen and secondly, the sweat bees were too small to touch the stigma of a M. guttatus flower. This asymmetry in gene flow was detected by a greater reduction in viable seed produced by M. nudatus plants when surrounded by M. guttatus plants than vice versa. Only when M. nudatus was the maternal parent could any hybrids be detected in field produced seed. To enable M. nudatus and M. guttatus to co-exist in sympatry, the two species may thus need to be sufficiently ecologically different. Such ecological differentiation was attributed to the greater drought tolerance of M. nudatus. In addition, greenhouse experiments suggested that M. nudatus may have evolved greater tolerance to calcium deficient soils.

The feeders were electromechanical devices, each controlled by a microprocessor, which monitored the experiments, controlled reward delivery and stored the data. The parameters that varied between the feeders were the amount and variance of reward. The four feeders were arranged in two pairs, with the two feeders in each pair set to the same reward parameters. Constant feeders offered a fixed amount of sucrose solution at each bee visit; variable feeders offered a normally distributed reward with a standard deviation equal to the mean. We tested three reward combinations under two variance conditions. The bees matched their choice frequencies to the mean amount of reward. This applied both to the constant and the variable feeders. Thus the bees were able to discriminate feeders by the amount of reward and were able to estimate the mean reward for the variable flowers. The proportion of immediate returns to the same feeder increased with the amount of sucrose solution imbibed at each visit, indicating that bees were able to perceive the amount of reward at each visit. However, there was no influence of variance on the choice behaviour of the bees, ruling out the possibility that bees are risk sensitive under these conditions. We discuss risk indifference in choice behaviour of bees in the context of several models of risk sensitivity.

Much more emphasis has been placed on the physiological characteristics of the sensory cells than on the central cellular mechanisms of taste processing. This is due to the fairly direct access for physiological experimentation presented by many taste sensilla and to the obvious importance of tastants in insect feeding and oviposition behaviour. In some of the insect models used for gustatory studies, advances have been made in understanding the basic morphology of the central neuropils involved in the first stages of taste processing. There is much less known about the physiology of interneurons involved. In this review, we concentrate on four insect models (Manduca sexta, Drosophila melanogaster, Neobellieria bullata (and other large flies), and Apis mellifera) to summarize morphological knowledge of peripheral and central aspects of insect gustation.

In this paper, we combine these two dimensions of variation (geographical space and phylogenetic history) to evaluate patterns of phenotypic evolution in honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). Data on 39 phenotypic traits, derived from 417 colonies grouped into 14 subspecies, were analysed using autocorrelation methods. Mantel tests indicated that the relationship between phenotypic divergence, estimated by Euclidean distances among subspecies' morphological centroids, was significant both when compared to geographical distance (r= 0.371; P < 0.01) and to genetic distance (estimated as sequence divergence (%) in a mtDNA region encompassing part of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 and isoleucine transfer RNA (r = 0.329; P < 0.01)). For the analysis of each trait, the effects of the geographical co-ordinates (latitude and longitude of subspecies geographical range) and of the phylogenetic patterns (defined by eigenvectors of the genetic distance matrix) on phenotypic variation were simultaneously analysed using an extension of a recently developed model, called Phylogenetic Eigenvector Regression (PVR). In general terms, the partial regression slopes indicated that the variation in the characters traditionally associated with adaptive processes, such as body and wing size, were better explained by geographical position. However, characters usually thought to be neutral, such as wing venation angle, were more associated with phylogeny. This is expected because PVR can be interpreted as a partition model, in which adaptive variation tends to be independent of phylogeny (and, in this case, associated with geography). In addition, the first principal component derived from the expected values of the model for each trait, which can be interpreted as the phenotypic variation predicted by phylogeny, is more structured in a north-south cline than are the original data, supporting an adaptive interpretation. The phylogeographical autocorrelation analyses performed in this study show that different traits are more related to one of the two dimensions of variation (geography and phylogeny), and these patterns can furnish insights into the nature of phenotypic evolution in these organisms.","Honey bees; Multivariate morphometrics; Phenotypic evolution; Phylogenetic autocorrelation; Phylogeography; Spatial autocorrelation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033403117

Two bands resolving at ~ 135 and 74 kDa were found to be the most affected proteins which also showed an apparent correlation with the degree of ovarian development and total haemolymph protein concentration. High protein content and accumulation of some proteins in the haemolymph can be believed to fulfil the requirements of developing ovaries. Comparison of results with electrophoretogram of larval haemolymph suggests that the ~74 kDa protein might be the larval serum protein (arylphorin).

We tested the hypothesis that genetic variation among bees for these factors influences genetic variation in behavioral development. Pairs of colonies showing genetic differences in rates of behavioral development were identified in a screening experiment and bees from these colonies were used for physiological and behavioral assays. Six pairs were assayed, three with European bees only and three with both European and Africanized bees. There was genetic variation for the following four components: (1) production of JH in four pairs (experiment 1); (2) sensitivity to JH in three pairs (experiment 2); (3) sensitivity to social inhibition in three pairs (experiment 3), and (4) potency of social inhibition in four pairs (experiment 4). Cross-fostering assays (experiment 5), which allowed all four components to be evaluated simultaneously, revealed genetic variation for production of JH, sensitivity to JH, or sensitivity to social inhibition in five of six pairs, and potency of social inhibition in five of six pairs. There was often evidence for genotypic differences in more than one component, and no consistent pattern of association among any of the components. Africanized bees had faster rates of behavioral development than Europe- an bees, but there were no racial differences in patterns of variation among the four components. These results indicate that there are at least several, apparently distinct, physiological processes associated with JH and colony age demography upon which natural selection can act to alter the rate of behavioral development in honeybees.","Africanized honeybee; Apis mellifera; European honeybee; Foraging; Juvenile hormone",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033369109

Within the mushroom bodies γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-immunoreactive feedback neurons are the most prominent neuron group. The plasticity of inhibitory neural activity within the mushroom body was investigated by analyzing modulations of odor responses of feedback neurons during olfactory learning in vivo. In the honeybee, Apis mellifera, feedback neurons were intracellularly recorded at their neurites. They produced complex patterns of action potentials without experimental stimulation. Summating postsynaptic potentials indicate that their synaptic input region lies within the lobes. Odor and antennal sucrose stimuli evoked excitatory phasic-tonic responses. Individual neurons responded to various odors; responses of different neurons to the same odor were highly variable. Response modulations were determined by comparing odor responses of feedback neurons before and after one-trial olfactory conditioning or sensitisation. Shortly after pairing an odor stimulus with a sucrose reward, odor-induced spike activity of feedback neurons decreased. Repeated odor stimulations alone, equally spaced as in the conditioning experiment, did not affect the odor-induced excitation. A single sensitisation trial also did not alter odor responses. These findings indicate that the level of odor-induced inhibition within the mushroom bodies is specifically modulated by experience.","Inhibitory feedback neurons; Insect; Intracellular recording; Olfactory learning; Sensitisation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343938859

The European honeybee (Apis mellifera), which was introduced to the islands for apiculture in the 1880s, became naturalized in a few islands shortly after introduction. To detect the impact of the honeybees upon native bee diversity, we analyzed pollen harvest by honeybees and surveyed the relative abundance of honeybees and native bees on flowers on several islands. Both hived and feral honeybee colonies were active throughout the year, harvesting pollen of both native and alien flowers and from both entomophilous and anemophilous flowers. Honeybees strongly depended on the alien plants, especially during winter to spring when native melittophilous flowers were rare. From June to November, honeybees exhaustively utilized native flowers, which had originally been utilized and pollinated by native bees. On Chichi and Haha Islands, where human disturbance of forests has been severe, both native and alien flowers were dominated by honeybees, and native bees were rare or extinct even in well-conserved forests. In contrast, on Ani Island and Haha's satellite islands where primary forests were well conserved and honeybees were still uncommon or absent, native bees remained dominant. These results suggest that competition for nectar and pollen of the native flowers between honeybees and native bees favors honeybees on the disturbed islands, which are thoroughly invaded by alien nectariferous, sometimes aggressive, weedy plants.","Bee community; Bonin islands; Introduced honeybee; Invasion; Oceanic island; Pollination",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000912247

Heterozygotes at the sex determination locus are normal, fertile females, whereas diploid zygotes that are homozygous develop into sterile males. This results in a strong heterozygote advantage, and the sex locus exhibits extreme polymorphism maintained by overdominant selection. We characterized the sex-determining region by genetic linkage and physical mapping analyses. Detailed linkage and physical mapping studies showed that the recombination rate is <44 kb/cM in the sex-determining region. Comparing genetic map distance along the linkage group III in three crosses revealed a large marker gap in the sex-determining region, suggesting that the recombination rate is high. We suggest that a 'hotspot' for recombination has resulted here because of selection for combining favorable genotypes, and perhaps as a result of selection against deleterious mutations.

Germination of the pollen grains in the flowers of the two species occurs only after rupture of the stigmatic surface. It is also necessary in both cases that pollinators (mainly Apis mellifera) visit the flowers for fruit and seed set to occur. A study of the pollen-pistil interaction indicated that there exists prezygotic self-incompatibility in these two species, probably of the gametophytic type, but some self-pollen tubes escape this control and self-fertilize some ovules. However, after hand self-pollination, fruit and seed set is very low for both species. This suggests the existence of a postzygotic rejection mechanism, which could be due either to the existence of late-acting self-incompatibility or to an early action of inbreeding depression, although there are lines of evidence that seem to point to the second possibility.

Artificially immobilised bees consumed more oxygen (averages: 7.4 and 6.9 μl O 2.min -1 at 25° and 35°C, respectively) than spontaneously motionless bees but less than active, freely moving individuals. Oxygen measurements in immobilised honeybees, therefore, are neither suited to determine the basal rate of oxygen metabolism nor to estimate the energy turnover of highly active, freely moving individuals. As was expected from thermographical temperature measurements, oxygen consumption by bees which were free to move within 95 ml Warburg vessels varied in a wide range. At an ambient temperature of 25°C it followed a bimodal distribution, with one peak below 20 and a second peak between 70-130 μl O 2.min -1. At 35°C oxygen consumption was always below 75 μl O 2.min -1. However, considering the bees' level of activity led to a clear reduction of variability of data. Spontaneously motionless bees consumed on average 3.2 and 4.3 μl O 2.min -1 at 25° and 35°C, respectively. In active bees the oxygen consumption rate was higher and related to the degree of activity and ambient temperature. Moderately active individuals consumed 48.4 μl O 2.min -1 at 25°C and 18.3 μl O 2.min -1 at 35°C. By contrast, fast walking bees had significantly higher oxygen consumption rates: 91.4 and 30.5 μl O 2.min -1 at 25° and 35°C, respectively. Since running speed of the active bees was not distinguishable by eye and the distribution of observed behaviours was identical at 25 and 35°C but oxygen consumption was 2.64-3.15 times higher at 25°C, it can be concluded that more energy is invested in thermoregulation than in motion at both ambient temperatures. © 1999 E.

The amounts of food stores and brood were measured during alternating periods of good weather (3 periods of 6 days each) and bad weather (3 periods of 5 days each), which was simulated by intense artificial rain. The amount of stored pollen typically increased during periods of good weather and decreased during phases of bad weather. The honey reserves were plentiful during the entire experiment. The larvae were classified into 2 categories according to their size: 'small' larvae (estimated fresh weight <140 mg) and 'large' larvae (estimated fresh weight ≥140 mg). The total number of larvae increased slightly and fairly consistently over the course of the whole study, but under different weather conditions there were significant differences in the amounts of small and large larvae. During bad weather periods, the number of large larvae decreased significantly and heavily, while the number of small larvae increased. In contrast, during good weather conditions, the number of large larvae significantly increased, and the number of small larvae did not change. The changes in the number of large larvae correlated well with the changes in the amount of pollen in the colony. It seems that, during bad weather, a decline in the pollen stores might alter the brood-feeding behaviour of nurse bees, and this can result in underfed larvae, which may be sealed at a lighter weight. As the decreases in the number of large larvae started early in the rainy period, when pollen was still available, the bees seem to switch very rapidly to a 'save resources' strategy when a period of lack arises. The results do not suggest that brood cannibalism was prevalent, although this behaviour is known to occur under bad weather conditions. © 1999 E.

This bacterium is also a key source of genes for transgenic expression to provide pest resistance in plants and microorganisms as pets control agents in so-called genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The potential effects on human health and the environment of GMOs involve several aspects that are only remotely or not at all related to Bt products, and they are therefore outside the scope of this monograph.1.1. Identity, biological characteristics and analytical methods. Bt is a facultative anaerobic, gram-positive bacterium that forms characteristic protein inclusions adjacent to the endospore. Bt subspecies can synthesize more than one parasporal inclusion. Bt is genetically indistinguishable from Bc, except for the ability of Bt to produce parasporal crystalline inclusions, which are toxic for certain invertebrates, especially species of insect larvae belonging to the insect orders Coleoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera. The parasporal inclusions are formed by different insecticidal crystal proteins (ICP). The crystals have various shapes (bipyramidal, cuboidal, flat rhomboid, spherical or composite with two crystal types), depending on their ICP composition. A partial correlation between crystal morphology, ICP composition, and bioactivity against target insects has been established. The basic phenotypic taxon is the subspecies, identified by the flagellar (H) serotype. By 1998, 67 subspecies had been described. The genes that encode the ICPs are mostly on plasmids. Each ICP is the product of a single gene. Most plasmids with ICP genes are readily transferred by conjugation between Bt strains and may be transferred to related species of bacteria. The phenotypic classification has now been complemented by molecular biological characterization, based on the sequence of the crystal (cry and cyt) genes rather than target organism specificity. Different domains of the ICP are responsible for host susceptibility (receptor recognition) and toxicity (pore formation). Techniques commonly used to characterize Bt strains or the ICP itself include cell wall fatty acid analysis, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotide DNA probes, plasmid profiles, polymerase chain reaction PCR analysis, DNA fingerprinting and SDS-PAGE profiles. Beta-exotoxin, a heat-stable nucleotide, is produced by some Bt subspecies during vegetative growth and may contaminate the products. Beta-exotoxin is toxic for almost all forms of life including humans and the target insect orders. During vegetative growth, various Bt strains produce an assortment of antibiotics, enzymes, metabolites and toxins, including Bc toxins, that may have detrimental effects on both target organisms and non-target organisms (NTOs). Spore counts do not accurately reflect the insecticidal activity of a Bt strain or Bt product. The potency (ITU/mg) of each Bt product is bioassayed using an international standard that uses a specific test insect. 1.2. Mode of action on target insects. The sporulated Bt with ICP or spore-ICP complexes must be ingested by a susceptible insect larva. The efficacy of the ICP depends on the solubilization in the midgut, the conversion of the protoxin to the biologically active toxin by proteolytic enzymes, specific membrane receptor binding by the C-terminal domain of the active toxin, and pore formation by the N-terminal domain with subsequent lysis of the epithelial cells. Spore germination and proliferation of the vegetative cells into the haemocoel may result in a septicaemia, contributing to the cause of death. Receptor binding by the ICP is the major determinant of host specificity by the different Bt ICPs. 1.3. Habitats. Many different Bt subspecies have been isolated from dead or dying insects mostly from the orders Coleoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera, but many subspecies have also been isolated from soil, leaf surfaces and other habitats. The carcasses of dead insects often contain large quantities of spores and ICPs that may enter the environment. The coleopteran-active and lepidopteran-active Bt subspecies are primarily associated with the soil and phylloplane (leaf surfaces), whereas the dipteran-active Bt subspecies are commonly found in aquatic environments. In the environment, the spores persist and vegetative growth may occur when conditions are favourable and nutrients are available.1.4 Commercial products, production and application. Conventional Bt products, which utilize naturally-occurring Bt strains, account for approximately 90% of the world MPCA market. Most Bt products contain ICP and viable spores, but in some Bti products the spores are inactivated. Each year some 13,000 tomes are produced using aerobic fermentation technology. Conventional Bt products have been targeted primarily against lepidopteran pests of agricultural and forestry crops; however in recent years, Bt strains active against coleopteran pests have also been marketed. Strains of Bti active against dipteran vectors of parasitic and viral diseases are being used in public health programmes. Commercial Bt formulations may be applied as an insecticide to foliage, soil, water environments or food storage facilities. After the application of a Bt subspecies to an ecosystem, the vegetative cells and spores may persist at gradually decreasing concentrations for weeks, months or years as a component of the natural microflora. The ICPs, however, are rendered biologically inactive within hours or days. 1.5 Effects of Ct on non-target organisms. Studies on mammals, particularly those on laboratory animals, have evaluated possible infectivity and toxicity of various Bt preparations, which include the ICPs, vegetative cells and spores. The ICPs, spores and vegetative cells of the Bt subspecies, which were administered by different routes, were mostly non-pathogenic and nontoxic to the various animal species tested. The vegetative cells and/or spores of Bt were demonstrated to persist for weeks without causing adverse effects. Bt has not been observed to adversely affect birds, fish or many other non-target aquatic vertebrates tested in a large number of laboratory and field studies. Relatively few species of aquatic invertebrates are susceptible to Bt under either laboratory or field conditions. Bt does not adversely affect earthworms. The Bt subspecies have generally been shown to be highly specific in their insecticidal activity for Coleoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera and have demonstrated little, if any, direct toxicity to nontarget arthropods. Most of the existing safety data on non-target arthropods has been generated using the Bt subspecies with activity against Diptera and Lepidoptera. Studies of Bti formulations free of toxic contaminants have not demonstrated deleterious effects on the vast majority of non-target arthropods. Some midges (Diptera: Chironomidae), which are closely related to mosquitos, have been shown to be susceptible to high dosages of Bti, but are not affected by mosquito larvicidal dosages. In field studies, transient decreases or increases in populations of some non-target arthropods have been reported. Many insect orders have been tested in either the laboratory or field, most of which have shown no effect from Btk. Mortality has been observed in honey-bees (Apis mellifera) after exposure to vegetatively growing Btt and Btk, but the effect does not seem to be related to spores or ICPs. In laboratory and field studies Btg demonstrated no adverse effect on honey-bees. Bte strains that produce beta-exotoxin have been shown to have adverse effects on non-target arthropods. 1.6. Exposure and effects of Bt on humans. The field application of Bt products can result in considerable aerosol and dermal exposure of workers. Agricultural uses of Bt can result in Bt contamination of potable water and food. With the exception of case reports on ocular and dermal irritation, no adverse health effects have been documented after occupational exposure to Bt products. Human volunteers ingested and inhaled large quantities of a Btk formulation but experienced no adverse health effects. Antibody titres to the vegetative cells, spores and spore-crystal complexes have been demonstrated in workers who spray Bt products; however, no adverse health effects were reported. There have been some case reports on the occurrence of Bt in patients with different infectious diseases. However,none of these studies unequivocally demonstrates an actual risk to human health from the use of Bt. Bt has not been reported to cause adverse effects on human health when present in drinking-water or food. 1.7. Conclusions. Owing to their specific mode of action, Bt products are unlikely to pose any hazard to humans or other vertebrates or to the great majority of non-target invertebrates provided that they are free from non-Bt microorganisms and biologically active products other than the ICPs. Bt products may be safely used for the control of insect pests of agricultural and horticultural crops as well as forests. They are also safe for use in aquatic environments including drinking-water reservoirs for the control of mosquito, black fly and nuisance insect larvae. However, it should be noted that vegetative Bt has the potential for the production of Bc-like toxins, the significance of which as a cause of human disease is not known.",,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033513030

The Central Anatolian ecotypes formed an intermingled cluster when individual bee values were considered whereas colony averages made possible the discrimination of the regional population into corresponding ecotypes. The analyses showed that the 57.62 % of the individual bees and 97.62 % of the colonies were included in their own groups.

We tested this prediction in the European beewolf, a sphecid wasp that hunts for honeybees as larval food. Because the method to quantify parental investment is of crucial importance, we compared the suitability of several different investment measures. Female/male cost ratios were determined from a sample and the total investment in sons and daughters was calculated. In addition, the actual number of prey items for sons and daughters was directly determined by excavating nests and counting the cuticle remains of the prey. Though mortality was high (70%), it had only a weak effect on the estimate of the investment ratio. Based on commonly used measures like fresh and dry weight of emerged adults, the investment ratio did not deviate from Fisher's prediction of equal investment. However, progeny weight considerably underestimates investment in males and investment in large progeny. Measures that reflect the allocation of resources more directly (amount of provisions, brood cell volume) revealed a significant male bias and thus contradicted Fisher's theory. Three kinds of explanation are discussed. First, non-adaptive explanations are unlikely. Second, from the spectrum of alternative adaptive theories, only models that assume a non-linear relationship between amount of investment and progeny fitness seem to be relevant for the study species. Third, though the number of prey in a brood cell seems to be a rather good measure of parental investment in European beewolves, some problems in measuring parental investment remain. These problems are of broad significance.","Cost ratio; Fisher; Investment measure; Male bias; Sex ratio",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033367576

Methods: Venom extracts of Apis Mellifera, Vespula spp or Polistes spp (Pharmalgen, ALK-Abello, Madrid) were administered to 70 patients with anaphylaxis elicited by Hymenoptera sting. A build up schedule of three clusters at weekly intervals was applied to all subjects. On the first day, patients received 0.1, 1, 5, 10, and 20 μg of venom every 30 minutes. On the second day, they received three 30 μg doses at the same interval, and on the third day, two doses of 50 μg. Once this schedule was completed, the interval between each dose was extended and a maintenance phase with 100 μg every 6 weeks was established. Results: Four patients developed systemic reactions with Apis Mellifera venom: grade I anaphylaxis in three and Muller grade IV in one. In the three cases of mild anaphylaxis, reactions developed within 10 and 30 minutes following one of the injections, whereas in the case of severe anaphylaxis, the reaction occurred one hour after the second cluster. All reactions reverse rapidly with treatment and no relapse occurred. Five patients presented important local reactions (2 Apis, 1 Vespula, 2 Polistes) build up schedule slowed down in nine cases and in no patient it was stopped. In all patients but one (who started maintenance phase with 70 μg), the optimal dose of 100 μg was reached. Conclusion: The cluster schedule for initiating immunotherapy with Hymenoptera venom has proved as safe as conventional schedules and has been well accepted by the patients.","Cluster; Hymenoptera venom; Immunotherapy; Safety; Tolerance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033374034

Here we examine the capability of the dorsal, ventral and frontal regions of the eye for colour detection. The minimum visual angle α(min) at which the bees detect a stimulus providing both chromatic contrast and receptor-specific contrast to the three receptor types varies for the different regions of the eye: 7.1 ± 0.5°for the ventral region, 8.2 ± 0.6° for the dorsal region and 4.0 ± 0.5°for the frontal region. Flight trajectories show that when the target was presented in the horizontal plane, bees used only the ventral region of their eyes to make their choices. When the targets appeared dorsally, bees used the frontodorsal region. This finding suggests that pure dorsal detection of coloured targets is difficult in this context. Furthermore, α(min) in the ventral plane depends on receptor-specific contrasts. The absence of S-receptor contrast does not affect the performance (α(min) = 5.9 ± 0.5°), whilst the absence of M- and L-receptor contrast significantly impairs the detection task. Minimal visual angles of 10.3 ± 0.9°and 17.6 ± 3°, respectively, are obtained in these cases. Thus, as for many visual tasks, the compound eye of the honeybee shows a regionalisation of colour detection that might be related to peripheral or central specialisations.","Compound eye; Detection; Honeybee; Regionalisation; Vision",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033401458

Furthermore, [D]- V5,8,I17,K21-melittin binds strongly and destabilizes only negatively charged phospholipid vesicles, in contrast to native melittin, which binds strongly also zwitterionic phospholipids. To understand the differences in the properties of melittin and its diastereomer, 2D-NMR experiments were carried out with [D]-V5,8,I17,K21-melittin, and polarized attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy experiments were done with both melittin and [D]-V5,8,I17,K21- melittin.

In the bee, specific interference with molecules to clarify their role in a certain behavior is difficult, because genetic approaches, such as mutants or transgenic animals, are not feasible at the moment. As a new approach in insects in vivo, we report the use of short antisense oligonucleotides. We show that phosphorothioate-modified oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to the mRNA of a catalytic subunit of PKA directly injected into the bee brain cause a reversible and specific downregulation of both the amount of the catalytic subunit and of PKA activity by 10-15%. The amounts of the regulatory subunit of PKA, as well as PKC, are not affected. The slight 'knockdown' of PKA activity during the training procedure, a classical olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex, neither affects acquisition nor memory retention 3 or 6 hr after training. However, it causes an impairment of long-term memory retention 24 hr after training. Downregulation of PKA 3 hr after training has no detectable effect on memory formation. We conclude that PKA contributes to the induction of a long-term memory 24 hr after training when activated during learning. Second, we demonstrate that the antisense technique is feasible in honeybees in vivo and provides a new and powerful tool for the study of the molecular basis of learning and memory formation in insects.","Antisense oligonucleotides; Apis mellifera; cAMP-dependent protein kinase; Honeybee; Insect; Long-term memory; Olfactory learning; PKA",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0342859340

These sites included sensory pathways, central pattern generator and modulatory interneurones as well as motoneurones of the feeding network. In the honeybee, a chemical (odour) appetitive conditioning paradigm resulted in cellular changes at different sites in the nervous system. In both the pond snail and the honeybee the activation of identified modulatory interneurones could substitute for the use of the chemical unconditioned stimulus, making these paradigms even more amenable to more detailed cellular and molecular analysis.","Apis mellifera; Appetitive learning; Cellular mechanisms; Classical conditioning; Lymnaea stagnalis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032731125

Our studies, by using 5-bromo-2- deoxyuridine incorporation and the Feulgen technique, show that immediately before pupation, the brain of the developing honey bee (Apis mellifera) contains approximately 2,000 neuroblasts devoted to the production of the mushroom body intrinsic neurons (Kenyon cells). These neuroblasts are descended from four clusters of 45 or fewer neuroblasts each already present in the newly hatched larva. Subpopulations of Kenyon cells, distinct in cytoarchitecture, position, and immunohistochemical traits, are born at different, but overlapping, periods during the development of the mushroom bodies, with the final complement of these neurons in place by the mid-pupal stage. The mushroom bodies of the adult honey bee have a concentric arrangement of Kenyon cell types, with the outer layers born first and pushed to the periphery by later born neurons that remain nearer the center of proliferation. This concentricity is further reflected in morphologic and immunohistochemical traits of the adult neurons, and is demonstrated clearly by the pattern of expression of Drosophila myocyte enhancer factor 2 (DMEF2)-like immunoreactivity. This is the first comprehensive study of larval and pupal development of the honey bee mushroom bodies. Similarities to patterns of neurogenesis observed in the mushroom bodies of other insects and in the vertebrate cerebral cortex are discussed.","BrdU; MEF2; Mushroom bodies; Postembryonic neurogenesis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033536930

Results of the present research show that: (1) bees readily consume each of the pesticides when placed in a sucrose solution; (2) the odors of the pesticides are not repellent to bees, and such odors can serve as conditioned stimuli; (3) learning occurs to various degrees when the insecticides are combined with the sucrose solution and used as an unconditioned stimulus; and (4) feeding the insecticides to the bees 1 h prior to conditioning leads to differing mortality.

Worker and queen honey bees were held in Benton queen cages and either left untreated or exposed to fluvalinate queen tabs for 3 or 7 days. Fluvalinate queen tabs were more than 99% effective in killing the varroa mites found on worker attendants in queen cages following exposure for 3 days. However, their use did not eliminate the risk of introducing varroa when requeening colonies. Three percent of infested cages (1/37 cages) had one live mite. Exposure to 1% fluvalinate a.i. for 3 or more days caused significant mortality in worker attendants and sublethal effects in queens. Exposure for 7 days caused significant mortality in queens. The position of the tabs in the cage did not significantly affect worker survival, although there was a trend toward higher survival rates in cages where the queen tab was placed under the screen rather than on the floor of the cage. Sublethal exposure to fluvalinate reduced the queen's ability to suppress supersedure, particularly in queens exposed for 3 days. Colonies headed by queens that had been exposed for 3 or 7 days showed no significant difference in the production of supersedure cells relative to colonies headed by unexposed queens, although there was a trend toward higher production of supersedure cells in colonies headed by fluvalinate-treated queens. A 3-day exposure to queen tabs resulted in much higher supersedure rates (67%) than in colonies headed by either unexposed or 7-day exposed queens. Queens that survived a 7-day treatment and were subsequently introduced into colonies had rates of supersedure similar to those of unexposed queens (29 and 20% respectively). Supersedure rates were not correlated to the number of worker attendants surviving in cages. The somewhat surprising result of a relatively low supersedure rate among 7-day exposed queens (compared to a high supersedure rate in queens exposed for a shorter period) likely occurred because ""weaker queens"" were killed before they could be introduced into colonies. The overall number of treated queens treated that survived to the end of the season (including both direct mortality from fluvalinate treatment and indirect mortality through supersedure) was not significantly different in queens treated for 3 or 7 days. Performance of colonies headed by the surviving queens (excluding queens that were superseded or replaced) did not vary significantly with respect to brood or honey production regardless of the treatment (P>0.05). In order to maintain productive colonies, beekeepers would have to purchase 40 to 52 % more replacement queens for requeening, than would be required if queen tabs were not used. Therefore, it is not recommended that these tabs be used as a means for ensuring mite-free replacement queens.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033238452

Bumblebees are active at different times and on different crop species and are, therefore, likely to have different exposure profiles. Unlike honeybees, deaths of bumblebees due to pesticides are unlikely to be reported, since the bees are not kept domestically and will die in small numbers.

Honey bees fan their wings to cool the colony, and often spread fluid in conjunction with this behavior to induce evaporative cooling. We present an additional, previously undescribed mechanism used by the honey bee to maintain constant colony temperature in response to localized temperature increases. Worker bees shield the comb from external heat sources by positioning themselves on hot interior regions of the hive's walls. Although honey comb and brood comb were both shielded, the temperature- sensitive brood received a greater number of heat shielders and was thus better protected from overheating. Heat shielding appears to be a context- dependent adaptive behavior performed by worker bees who would previously have been considered 'unemployed'.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032878305

We have developed a gel formulation of formic acid which provides controlled release over 2-3 weeks and improves the convenience and safety of handling of formic acid. The strong acidity of formic acid restricts the choice of gelling agents; vegetable gellants such as agar are destroyed, and bentonite clay derivatives do not gel, even with high-shear mixing. Polyacrylamides lead to viscous liquids lacking thixotropic properties. High-molecular-weight poly(acrylic acids) and fumed silicas provided gels with suitable physical characteristics. The poly(acrylic acid) gels were difficult to mix and gave slower and nonlinear release behavior, while the fumed silica gels were easy to prepare and linear in formic acid vaporization.","Acarapis woodi; Acaricide; Apis mellifera; Formic acid; Fumed silica; Gel; Honey bees; Poly(acrylic acid); Tracheal mite; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032866286

The predicted amino acid sequence of the putative Apis amylase showed 60.5% identity with Drosophila melanogaster α-amylase, whereas that of Apis glucose oxidase showed 23.8% identity with Aspergillus niger glucose oxidase. To determine whether the isolated cDNAs actually encode these enzymes, we purified amylase and glucose oxidase from homogenized forager-bee hypopharyngeal glands. We sequenced the N-terminal regions of the purified enzymes and found that they matched the corresponding cDNAs. mRNAs for both enzymes were detected by Northern blotting in the hypopharyngeal gland of the forager bee but not in the nurse-bee gland.

Antibodies raised against dopamine were used to follow the development of a small population of dopamine-immunoreactive neurons that invade the antennal lobes during metamorphic adult development. Immunopositive somata associated with the antennal lobes were first detected at stage 2 of the nine stages of metamorphic adult development, but processes of these neurons within the antennal-lobe neuropil did not exhibit immunostaining until pupal stage 3. Severe depletion of primary sensory input to the right antennal lobe early in metamorphic adult development or removal of the right antenna from newly emerged bees did not alter the expression of dopamine immunoreactivity in the antennal-lobe neuropil. The presence of dopamine in developing antennal lobes was confirmed by using high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Levels of dopamine were significantly higher at pupal stage 4 than at all other stages examined. This surge in dopamine levels coincided with rapid growth and compartmentalisation of the antennal-lobe neuropil. Exogenously applied dopamine (50 μM) enhanced the growth of antennal-lobe neurons in vitro, but only in cells derived from pupae at stage 5 of metamorphic adult development. The early appearance of dopamine-immunoreactive neurons and the effects of dopamine on stage 5 antennal-lobe neurons in vitro support the view that dopamine plays a role in the developing brain of the honey bee.","Catecholamine; Immunohistochemistry; Olfactory bulb insect; Sensory input",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033530084

Ethanolic extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from crude propolis samples collected in Minas Gerais state (MG), southeastern Brazil, and Rio Grande do Sul state (RS), southern Brazil. The flavonoid composition of EEP was analyzed by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). For the animal study, 30 specific pathogen-free Wistar rats were infected with Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 and surgically desalivated. The rats were randomly divided into three groups which were treated with 80% ethanol (control), EEP from MG and EEP from RS. The animals were placed in a König-Höfer programmed feeder and received 17 meals of diet 2000 daily at hourly intervals. The solutions were applied on the rat molars (25 μl on molars of each quadrant) twice a day, by using graduate syringes. After 3 weeks, the animals were killed by CO2 asphyxiation. For microbial assessment, the left jaw was removed and sonicated in 154 mM NaCl solution. Dental caries was evaluated according to Larson's modification of Keyes' system. The HPTLC patterns and HPLC profiles demonstrated that both quality and quantity of flavonoid aglycones of EEP from MG were different compared to EEP from RS. In general, it is apparent that EEP from RS contained the highest concentrations of pinocembrin, chrysin, acacetin and galangin. The group of animals treated with EEP from RS showed the lowest smooth-surface and sulcal caries scores as well as less caries severity in smooth-surface and sulcal lesions, and these data were statistically different when compared with the control group. The group treated with EEP from MG only demonstrated a significant difference in the severity of sulcal lesions when compared to the control group. The percentage of S. sobrinus was lower in the groups treated with EEP, but did not differ statistically from the control group. The results showed that the cariostatic effect of propolis depends on its composition, and consequently the region of collection of propolis samples.","Caries; Cariostatic effect; Flavonoid compounds; Propolis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033194377

The honeybee queen pheromone is known to play a crucial role in colony organization, in addition to drone sex attraction. We identified, for the first time in a social insect, a binding protein called antennal-specific protein 1 (ASP1), which binds at least one of the major queen pheromone components. ASP1 was characterized by cDNA cloning, expression in Pichia pastoris, and pheromone binding, in situ hybridization showed that it is specifically expressed in the auxiliary cell layer of the antennal olfactory sensilla. The ASP1 sequence revealed it as a divergent member of the insect OBP family. The recombinant protein presented the exact characteristics of the native protein, as shown by mass spectrometry, and N-terminal sequencing and exclusion-diffusion chromatography showed that recombinant ASP1 is dimeric. ASP1 interacts with queen pheromone major components, opposite to another putative honeybee OBP, called ASP2. ASP1 biosynthetic accumulation, followed by nondenaturing electrophoresis during development, starts at day I before emergence, in concomitance with the functional maturation of olfactory neurons. The isobar ASP1b isoform appears simultaneously to ASP1a in workers, but only at ~2 weeks after emergence in drones. Comparison of in vivo and heterologous expressions suggests that the difference between ASP1 isoforms might be because of dimerization, which might play a physiological role in relation with mate attraction.","Antenna; Binding protein; Honeybee; Olfaction; Pichia pastoris expression; Queen pheromone; Sensilla",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033198221

An F1 queen was produced from a cross between a queen of European origin and a drone descended from an African subspecies. Haploid drones from the hybrid queen were individually backcrossed to European queens to produce 172 colonies. Samples of stings were taken from backcross workers of these colonies. Alarm pheromone levels were determined by gas chromatography, RAPD markers were scored from the haploid drone fathers of these colonies. The multiple-QTL model (MQM) of MapQTL was used to identify QTLs that influence the levels of four alarm pheromone components. Seven independent, potential QTLs were identified with LOD scores greater than two, and one at LOD 1.88. We identified one QTL for n-decyl acetate, three for n-octanol, four for isopentyl acetate, and one for hexyl acetate. One region of linkage group XI shows a strong influence on body size and the levels of three alarm pheromone components. This locus explained 40% of the variance for the amount of n-decyl acetate (LOD 6.57). In general, the QTLs influencing alarm pheromone levels were independent of previously identified loci that influenced the stinging behavior of these colonies.

This visual discrimination allows us to measure resolution, and to search for the cues that the bees remember and later use to recognize the rewarded pattern. Two systems in parallel, analogous to low pass and high pass filters, are distinguished. The first system discriminates the location and size of at least one area of contrast on each side of the target, with inputs from blue and green receptors, but the ability to discriminate the location of colour depends upon fixation. The bees remember less than a low resolution copy of the image, even when they fixate on a vertical pattern. The second system amplifies the contrast at edges in the pattern, ignoring the direction of contrast, and controls fixation upon the target. Edges are discriminated according to their orientation and radial or tangential arrangement. An axis of bilateral symmetry is detected. However, the relative locations of cues within the image are lost, apparently because the relevant neurones have very large fields. Only the cues, not the whole patterns, are preserved in memory. This system is colour blind because its input is restricted to the receptors with peak sensitivity in the green. The two systems together discriminate many simple patterns, but not all, because the filters are limited in variety.","Apis mellifera; Honeybee; Memory; Pattern; Vision",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032843549

In aqueous solution at low pH melittin is predominantly unstructured. Addition of HFA at pH ≃ 2.0 induces a structural transition from the unstructured state to a predominantly helical conformation as suggested by intense diagnostic far UV CD bands. The structural transition is highly cooperative and complete at 3.6 M (50% v/v) HFA. A similar structural transition is also observed in 2,2,2 trifluoroethanol which is complete only at a cosolvent concentration of ≃ 8 M. Temperature dependent CD experiments support a 'cold denaturation' of melittin at low concentrations of HFA, suggesting that selective solvation of peptide by HFA is mediated by hydrophobic interactions. NMR studies in 3.6 M HFA establish a well-defined helical structure of melittin at low pH, as suggested by the presence of strong NH(i)/NH(i+1) NOEs throughout the sequence, along with many medium range helical NOEs. Structure calculations using NOE-driven distance constraints reveal a well-ordered helical fold with a relatively flexible segment around residues T10-G11-T12. The helical structure of melittin obtained at 3.6 M HFA at low pH is similar to those determined in methanolic solution and perdeuterated dodecylphosphocholine micelles.

We tested assumptions of three task regulation models for how honeybee colonies respond to graded changes in need for a specific task, pollen foraging. We gradually changed colony pollen stores and measured behavioral and genotypic changes in the foraging population. Colonies did not respond in a graded manner, but in six of seven cases showed a stepwise change in foraging activity as pollen storage levels moved beyond a set point. Changes in colony performance resulted from changes in recruitment of new foragers to pollen collection, rather than from changes in individual foraging effort. Where we were able to track genotypic variation, increases in pollen foraging were accompanied by a corresponding increase in the genotypic diversity of pollen foragers. Our data support previous findings that genotypic variation plays an important role in task regulation. However, the stepwise change in colony behavior suggests that colony foraging flexibility is best explained by an integrated model incorporating genotypic variation in task choice, but in which colony response is amplified by social interactions.","Apis mellifera; Division of labor; Genetics; Honeybee; Pollen foraging",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032867305

We report an experiment that tests this tuned-error hypothesis. We measured the precision of direction indication in waggle dances advertising a nest site (typically a tree cavity, hence a target that is almost a point) and compared it with that of dances advertising a food source (typically a flower patch, hence a target that covers an area). The precision of dances for a nearby nest site was significantly higher than that of dances for an equidistant feeder. This was demonstrated four times with four colonies. Our evidence therefore supports the hypothesis that the level of precision in the direction indication for nearby food sources is tuned to its optimum without being at its maximum.","Apis mellifera; Communication; Honeybee; Recruitment; Swarms; Tuned-error hypothesis; Waggle dance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-18144448367

However, an extremely rare 'anarchistic' phenotype occurs, in which workers develop functional ovaries and lay large numbers of haploid eggs which develop into adult drones despite the presence of the queen. Studies of such colonies can give important insights into the mechanisms by which worker sterility is maintained in normal colonies. Here we report on the results of a breeding programme which enhanced the frequency of the anarchistic phenotype. Colonies derived from queens inseminated only by worker-laid males showed up to 9% of workers with highly developed ovaries. In these colonies a large proportion of males arose from worker-laid eggs. Colonies headed by queens inseminated with 50% worker-laid drones and 50% queen-laid drones showed variable phenotypes. In most such colonies there was no worker reproduction. In some, many workers had highly developed ovaries, but no worker-laid eggs were reared. In one colony, many worker-laid eggs were reared to maturity. The results suggest that the anarchy phenotype results from a complex interaction of queen genotype, the worker genotype of subfamilies that successfully reproduce and of those that do not, and the external environment.","Anarchy; Apis mellifera; Kin selection; Laying workers; Social insects; Worker policing",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033532966

This is the first report of the occurrence of this peptide in a non-lepidopteran insect and of an intraspecific variation with regards to the presence or absence of a hypertrehalosaemic peptide in the CC of an insect.

Conditioning pollen and nectar foragers with similar response thresholds did not yield differences in their learning performance. These results suggest that differences in the learning performance of pollen and nectar foragers are a consequence of differences in their perception of sucrose.

They had hypopharyngeal glands that were larger and contained more protein, their thoraces had a higher protein content, and they had a higher rate of proteolytic activity in the midgut.

Foragers collect nectar and take it to the nest, where they transfer it to receiver bees who then store it in cells. Because nectar is a fluctuating and unpredictable resource, changes in worker allocation are required to balance the work capacities of foragers and receivers so that the resource is exploited efficiently. Honey bee colonies use a complex system of signals and other feedback mechanisms to coordinate the relative and total work capacities of the two groups of workers involved. We present a functional evaluation of each of the component mechanisms used by honey bees - waggle dance, tremble dance, stop signal, shaking signal and abandonment - and analyse how their interplay leads to group-level regulation. We contrast the actual regulatory system of the honey bee with theory. The tremble dance conforms to predicted best use of information, where the group in excess applies negative feedback to itself and positive feedback to the group in shortage, but this is not true of the waggle dance. Reasons for this and other discrepancies are discussed. We also suggest reasons why honey bees use a combination of recruitment plus abandonment and not switching between subtasks, which is another mechanism for balancing the work capacities of foragers and receivers. We propose that the waggle and tremble dances are the primary regulation mechanisms, and that the stop and shaking signals are secondary mechanisms, which fine-tune the system. Fine-tuning is needed because of the inherent unreliability of the cues, queueing delays, which foragers use to make recruitment decisions.","Honey bee; Nectar foragers; Receiver bees; Shaking signal; Signals; Stop signal; Tremble dance; Waggle dance; Worker allocation",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032802316

This colony pattern was a result of the following individual behavioural decisions: continue foraging, abandon the feeder, restart foraging and initiate foraging. Only very rarely did individuals switch from one feeder to the other. With the first combination of a rich (2.7 M) and a poor (0.8 M) feeder M. fasciata behaved differently from Apis mellifera. Recruitment occurred to both feeders and the poor feeder was not abandoned completely. When the poor feeder was set to 0.4 M, M. fasciata abandoned the poor feeder rapidly and allocated more foragers to the rich feeder. These patterns were similar to those reported for A. mellifera with the first combination of feeders. Over a sequence of 4 days, experienced bees increasingly determined the colony patterns, and the major function of communication between workers became the reactivation of experienced foragers. The foragers modulated their behaviour not only according to the profitability of the feeder, but also according to previous experience with profitability switches. Thus, experience and communication together regulated colony foraging behaviour. These findings and the results of studies with honeybees suggest that M. fasciata and honeybees use similar decision-making mechanisms and only partly different tools.","Communication; Decision-making mechanisms; Learning; Melipona; Nectar collecting; Social foraging; Stingless bees",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032771963

They are comprised of numerous (340,000 in the bee brain), small (3-8 μm soma diameter) local interneurons, the Kenyon cells. In the brain of honeybees (Apis mellifera) of all castes (worker bees, drones and queens), wasps (Vespula germanica) and hornets (Vespa crabro) immunostaining revealed fibers with dopamine, like immunoreactivity projecting from the pedunculus and the lip neuropil of the mushroom bodies into the Kenyon cell perikaryal layer. These fibers terminate with numerous varicosities, mainly around the border between medial and lateral Kenyon cell soma groups. Visualization of immunostained terminals in the transmission electron microscope showed that they directly contact the somata of the Kenyon cells and contain presynaptic elements. The somata of the Kenyon cells are clearly non-immunoreactive. Synaptic contacts at the somata are unusual for the central nervous systems of insects and other arthropods.

'Blocking' means that learning about a stimulus B is reduced when trained in compound with a stimulus A that has previously been trained alone. Thus, reinforcement of B in these circumstances is not sufficient to induce learning. Such blocking is a frequently observed phenomenon in vertebrate learning and has also recently been reported in honeybee olfactory learning. To explain blocking, current models of conditioning include cognition-like concepts of attention or expectation which, consequently, seem also to apply to honeybees. Here, we first reproduce a blocking-like effect in an experimental design taken from the literature. We identify two confounding variables in that design and experimentally demonstrate their potential to support a blocking-like effect. After eliminating these confounding variables using a series of different training procedures, the blocking-like effect disappeared.

One of these inhibitors was purified by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration, Q-Sepharose FF ion-exchange chromatography and Butyl Sepharose 4FF hydrophobic chromatography. The purified PLI inhibited the enzymic activities of all PLA2 groups, including Elapidae venom (group-I), Viperidae venom (group-II) and honeybee PLA2s (group-III). The inhibitor was a 130 kDa glycoprotein consisting of two distinct subunits, A and B, of 30 and 29 kDa respectively; each of which was glycosylated with N-linked oligosaccharide chains. The cDNAs encoding the respective inhibitor subunits were isolated from a liver cDNA library by the use of probes, prepared by PCR, based on the partially determined amino-acid sequences of the corresponding subunits. The respective nucleotide sequences encoded 19-amino-acid-residue signal sequences, followed by 183- and 181-residue protein sequences for the A and B subunits respectively. The amino-acid sequences revealed that the E. quadririrgata inhibitor corresponded to PLIγ, one of three kinds of inhibitors purified from venomous snakes. The existence of PLIγ in the serum of this non-venomous snake suggested that, besides having a protective role against the venom PLA2s of other venomous snakes, PLIγ has other important physiological functions in regulating local PLA2 activities; and thus it raises the possibility that PLIγ occurs in other animals, including mammals.","cDNA cloning; Phospholipase A2; Serum",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033166803

Three forms of the inhibitor, designated AMCI 1- 3, were isolated using gel filtration and anion-exchange chromatographies followed by reverse-phase HPLC. The amino-acid analyses indicated that AMCI- 1 and AMCI-2 have an identical composition whereas AMCI-3 is shorter by two residues (Thr, Arg). All three forms contain as many as 10 cysteine residues and lack tryptophan, tyrosine, and histidine. The sequence of the isoinhibitors showed that the major form (AMCI-1) consisting of 56 amino- acid residues was a single-chain protein of molecular mass 5972 Da, whereas the other two forms were two-chain proteins with a very high residue identity. The AMCI-2 appeared to be derived from AMCI-1, as a result of the Lys24-Thr25 peptide bond splitting, while AMCI-3 was truncated at its N- terminus by the dipeptide Thr25-Arg26. The association constants for the binding of bovine α-chymotrypsin to all purified forms of the inhibitor were high and nearly identical, ranging from 4.8 x 1010 M-1 for AMCI-1 to 2.7 x 109 M-1 for AMCI-3. The sensitivity of cathepsin G to inhibition by each inhibitor was different. Only the association constant for the interaction of this enzyme with AMCI-1 was high (2 x 10-8 M-1) whereas those for AMCI-2 and AMCI-3 were significantly lower, and appeared to be 3.7 x 107 M-1 and 4 5 x 106 M-1, respectively. The reactive site of the inhibitor, as identified by cathepsin G degradation and chemical modification, was found to be at Met30-Gln31. A search in the Protein Sequence Swiss-Prot databank revealed a significant degree of identity (44%) between the primary structure of AMCI and the trypsin isoinhibitor from Ascaris sp (ATI). On the basis of the cysteine residues alignment, the position of the reactive site as well as some sequence homology, the cathepsin G/chymotrypsin inhibitor from larval hemolymph of the honey bee may be considered to be a member of the Ascaris inhibitor family.","Ascaris-inhibitor family; Cathepsin G inhibitor; Chymotrypsin inhibitor; Honey bee; Sequencing",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0005945807

Neurons were stained intracellularly with Lucifer yellow at different stages of pupal development and in the adult, and imaged by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Attending to branching patterns, all pupal neurons could be attributed to morphological types previously established in the adult. Given the functional importance of intraglomerular dendritic arbors in the processing of olfactory information, the study focused on their development. The two main classes, dense and sparse intraglomerular arbors, display adultlike features as early as the second day of pupal development. However, morphometric measurements and confocal observations show that their general pattern undergoes continuous maturation processes until late pupal stages and after emergence of the adult.

To determine the heat-exchange pathways through which flying honeybees achieve thermal stability, we measured body temperatures and rates of carbon dioxide production and water vapor loss between T(a) values of 21 and 45°C for honeybees flying in a respirometry chamber. Body temperatures were not significantly affected by continuous flight duration in the respirometer, indicating that flying bees were at thermal equilibrium. Thorax temperatures (T(th)) during flight were relatively stable, with a slope of T(th) on T(a) of 0.39. Metabolic heat production, calculated from rates of carbon dioxide production, decreased linearly by 43% as T(a) rose from 21 to 45°C. Evaporative heat loss increased nonlinearly by over sevenfold, with evaporation rising rapidly at T(a) values above 33°C. At T(a) values above 43°C, head temperature dropped below T(a) by approximately 1-2°C, indicating that substantial evaporation from the head was occurring at very high T(a) values. The water flux of flying honeybees was positive at T(a) values below 31°C, but increasingly negative at higher T(a) values. At all T(a) values, flying honeybees experienced a net radiative heat loss. Since the honeybees were in thermal equilibrium, convective heat loss was calculated as the amount of heat necessary to balance metabolic heat gain against evaporative and radiative heat loss. Convective heat loss decreased strongly as T(a) rose because of the decrease in the elevation of body temperature above T(a) rather than the variation in the convection coefficient. In conclusion, variation in metabolic heat production is the dominant mechanism of maintaining thermal stability during flight between T(a) Values of 21 and 33°C, but variations in metabolic heat production and evaporative heat loss are equally important to the prevention of overheating during flight at T(a) values between 33 and 45°C.","Apis mellifera; Flight energetics; Heat budget; Honeybee; Thermoregulation; Water loss",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032966942

A vital colony structure is the comb which stores honey for overwinter survival. However, the timing of comb construction poses a dilemma to a colony attempting to maximize its honey reserves. On the one hand, plenty of empty comb is needed for efficient exploitation of temporally unpredictable flower blooms. On the other hand, because comb is made from energetically expensive wax, its construction too early or in excessive amounts will reduce the amount of honey available for winter thermoregulation and brood-rearing. A dynamic optimization model concludes that colonies should add new comb only when they have filled their old comb with food and brood above a threshold level. The threshold increases with time until, at the end of the season, building is never an optimal behavior. The temporal pattern of construction predicted by the model - pulses of building coincident with periods of nectar intake and comb fullness - matches that seen in an actual colony observed over the course of an entire foraging season. When nectar sources are rich but temporally clumped, the model also predicts that bees should be sensitive to nectar intake, employing much higher thresholds on days when nectar is not available than on days when it is. Even under poorer and more dispersed nectar regimes, little fitness cost is paid by colonies replacing the optimal strategy with a simpler rule of thumb calling for new construction only when two conditions are met: (1) a fullness threshold has been exceeded, and (2) nectar is currently being collected. Experiments demonstrate that colonies do in fact use such a rule of thumb to control the onset of construction. However, once they have begun building, the bees continue as long as nectar collection persists, regardless of changes in comb fullness. Thus the onset and duration of comb-building bouts appear to be under partially independent control.","Apis mellifera; Dynamic programming; Honeybee; Nest construction; Resource allocation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032978359

Bees, like many other nesting animals, primarily use learned visual features of the environment to guide their movement between the nest and foraging sites. Although much is known about the spatial information encoded in memory by experienced bees, the development of large-scale spatial memory in naive bees is not clearly understood. Past studies suggest that learning occurs during orientation flights taken before the start of foraging. We investigated what honeybees learn during their initial experience in a new landscape by examining the homing of bees displaced after a single orientation flight lasting only 5-10 min. Homing ability was assessed using vanishing bearings and homing speed. At release sites with a view of the landmarks immediately surrounding the hive, 'first-flight' bees, tested after their very first orientation flight, had faster homing rates than 'reorienting foragers', which had previous experience in a different site prior to their orientation flight in the test landscape. First-flight bees also had faster homing rates from these sites than did 'resident' bees with full experience of the terrain. At distant sites, resident bees returned to the hive more rapidly than reorienting or first-flight bees; however, in some cases, the reorienting bees were as successful as the resident bees. Vanishing bearings indicated that all three types of bees were oriented homewards when in the vicinity of landmarks near the hive. When bees were released out of sight of these landmarks, hence forcing them to rely on a route memory, the 'first-flight' bees were confused, the 'reorienting' bees chose the homeward direction except at the most distant site and the 'resident' bees were consistently oriented homewards.","Apis mellifera; Homing; Honeybee; Learning; Navigation; Orientation; Spatial memory",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033152078

We report the success of a molecular- genetic approach for studying queen- and worker-specific gene expression in the development of the honey bee (Apis mellifera). Numerous genes appear to be differentially expressed between the two castes. Seven differentially expressed loci described here belong to at least five distinctly different evolutionary and functional groups. Two are particularly promising as potential regulators of caste differentiation. One is homologous to a widespread class of proteins that bind lipids and other hydrophobic ligands, including retinoic acid. The second locus shows sequence similarity to a DNA- binding domain in the Ets family of transcription factors. The remaining loci appear to be involved with downstream changes inherent to queen- or worker- specific developmental pathways.

Since the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation via protein kinase A (PKA) and the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) contribute to different aspects of associative olfactory learning in the honeybee, the localization of PKA and PKC in the neuronal circuitry is of general interest. The presented immunohistological study compares the distribution of PKA and PKC in honeybee brain focusing on the antennal lobes and the mushroom bodies, neuropiles implicated in olfactory learning. While PKA, is found in all neuropiles and somata throughout the honeybee brain, the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent PKC is concentrated in the antennal lobes and the mushroom bodies. In the antennal lobes, the primary neuropiles of olfactory information processing, PKAII is localized in sensory neurons and interneurons. In contrast, the PKC-immunolabeling is exclusively due to interneurons with a characteristically strong labeling of the central area of the antennal lobes. The mushroom bodies show the highest PKC- and PKAII- immunostaining of the brain. PKAII and PKC are expressed at different levels in different subsets of the mushroom body intrinsic Kenyon cells. This different distribution of PKAII and PKC in the antennal lobes and the mushroom bodies, at least in part, accounts for the different roles of PKAII and PKC mediated phosphorylation in olfactory learning.","Antennal lobes; Calcium; cAMP; Learning; Memory; Mushroom bodies; Phospholipid",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345593714

The p50 protein was further purified by an affinity column with a monoclonal antibody raised against p50 in mice. The p50 protein induced an inflammatory reaction following injection into mouse ear; that is, degranulation of mast cells, edema, hyperemia and hyperpermeation of the local capillaries were observed. The reaction was very similar to that seen when phospholipase A2 of AM, a representative bee venom, was administered by injection. The inflammatory reaction induced by p50 was completely inhibited by mixing p50 with α1-m prior to injection. These results indicate that p50 is a unique venom component of the Asian bee that induces the inflammatory reaction and that human α1-m may be involved as a protective mechanism against bee stings of at least some Asian bee species.","Asian bee; Bee venom; Inflammatory reaction; α1-microglobulin",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033583592

Depending on the mosaic pattern of the head, both antennae can be drone-like or worker- like, or one can be drone-like and the other worker-like. Examination of the antennal lobes of six characteristic specimens revealed that antennal lobes, which are innervated by drone-like antennae, always have drone-specific enlarged tracts and macroglomerular complexes, whereas antennal lobes innervated by worker-like antennae always are composed of normally sized glomeruli. Thus, there is a strict correlation between the sexual morphology of the antennae and the sexual organization of the antennal lobe neuropil. In one antennal lobe, innervated by a hybrid antenna, we found a hypertrophied glomerulus, certainly homologous to one of the macroglomerular complexes in drone-like antennal lobes.","Antenna; Antennal lobe; Gynandromorphs; Macroglomerular complex; Sexual dimorphism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033120484

In Apis, this organ consists of an unpaired ampulla from which blood vessels that extend into the antennae originate. The ampulla is a very delicate structure of elastic connective tissue. Its lumen communicates with the head hemocoel via numerous perforations in its wall. No specific ampulla muscles exist; contraction of pharynx dilators causes compression of the ampulla, whereby hemolymph is forced into the antennae. An absence of directly-acting muscles is common to the functional morphologies of the antennal circulatory organ in all investigated Hymenoptera. Some anatomical characters of this organ, however, vary among taxa: (i) presence of one or two ampullae, (ii) optional dorsal hemolymph channel, which connects the ampulla with the dorsal vessel, (iii) optional ampulla pumping case formed by cuticular apophyses, and (iv) differences in shape and number of the ampulla openings. The distribution of these characters is discussed along the current views on the phylogeny of Hymenoptera.

The pairs of patterns were selected to test the hypothesis that bees have a limited number of parallel mechanisms for the detection and discrimination of certain generalized global features. If this is so, it might be expected that each channel could process one pair of patterns simultaneously, but two pairs of patterns that are processed by the same channel would interfere with each other during the learning process. Features tested were: average orientation of edges, radial and tangential edges based on a symmetry of three or six, the position of a black spot, and the exchange of black and white.

Semi-quantitative analysis by reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) throughout honeybee development detected a higher level of expression of this gene in queen larvae than in worker larvae. Analysis of two other genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COX-1; mitochondrial-encoded) and cytochrome c (cyt c; nuclear-encoded) also showed differential expression of these two genes between queens and workers. In particular, the cyt c transcript is more abundant in queen larvae and throughout the metamorphosis of the queen.

The inconspicuous flowers with vestigial green petals and sepals may attract pollinators by means of the lenslike, spherical droplets of nectar on glaucous floral discs that sparkle in the sunlight, and concentrate and reflect visible and ultraviolet light. Such flowers are here named 'sparkle-flowers' (new coinage).","'sparkle-flowers'; Bees; Competition; Cornaceae; Euphorbia; Gum; Hedera; Insect pollination; Nyssa; Reflective nectar; Tupelo; Ultraviolet",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032966586

Flight capacity is also affected by dimensional, morphological relationships of mass and area which allow an estimation of an 'excess power index'. The dimensions of the flight machinery of honeybees (based on our own data) were coupled with the frequency distributions of Mdh (taken from the literature) to compare nine subspecies of African and nine European honeybees, Apis mellifera as miniature aircraft. The two groups differed significantly for five dimensions of flight machinery and in the distribution frequencies of Mdh phenotypes. In the African group, northern and southern subgroups occurred which significantly differed in body mass and excess power index, while flight engine and body mass varied proportionately. In the European group, wing surface was nearly constant but body mass and the thorax/body mass ratio varied significantly resulting in significantly differing wing loading values. The final excess power index (modified for allozyme phenotype) of the European bees reflected both flight machinery and allozymic differences. Mdh allozymic phenotype frequencies were correlated with the dimensional morphological components of the excess power index. As a group, the European subspecies of honeybees were 33% heavier and had 15% more wing surface area than the African group. However, the former have a thorax/body mass ratio of 0.45 and wing loading value of 0.48 against the latter's 0.53 and 0.35 respectively. This confers an advantage on the African group solely on the grounds of dimensions because there was proportionately less mass per unit area of wing surface and so lower lift requirement. The better engine to aircraft mass ratio provides greater power per unit mass in the African group taken as miniature aircraft. Differences in metabolic capacity associated with Mdh allozymes (taken from the literature) finally result in an excess power index that is 38% greater in the African than European subspecies of honeybees.","Allozymes; Flight machinery; Honeybee; Malate dehydrogenase; Micro-aircraft",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032907418

It has been shown that nectar foragers indirectly gather information about the nectar supply of the colony from nestmates without estimating the amount of honey actually stored in the combs. Very little is known about how the actual colony need is perceived with respect to pollen foraging. Two factors influence the need for pollen: the quantity of pollen stored in cells and the amount of brood. To elucidate the mechanisms of perception, we changed the environment within normal-sized colonies by adding pollen or young brood and measured the pollen-foraging activity, while foragers had either direct access to them or not. Our results show that the amount of stored pollen, young brood, and empty space directly provide important stimuli that affect foraging behavior.

Workers are usually daughters of a single, singly mated queen. This observation, coupled with the multiple mating of honeybee queens permits kin selection theory to account for many differences in the social biology of the two taxa. First, in contrast to honeybees, where workers are predicted to and do police each other's male production, stingless bee workers are predicted to compete directly with the queen for rights to produce males. This leads to behavioural and reproductive conflict during oviposition. Second, the risk that a daughter queen will attack the mother queen is higher in honeybees, as is the cost of such an attack to workers. This explains why stingless bees commonly have virgin queens in the nest, but honeybees do not. It also explains why in honeybees the mother queen leaves to found a new nest, while in stingless bees it is the daughter queen who leaves.","Apis; Kin selection; Mate number; Meliponini; Microsatellite; Social conflict",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033593923

Acetylcholine-induced currents of mushroom body Kenyon cells from the honey bee Apis mellifera were studied using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique.

The cholinergic agonists ACh and carbamylcholine had almost equal potencies of current activation at concentrations between 0.01 and 1 mM; nicotine was less potent.

The channel lifetimes, calculated from the frequency spectra, were τ0 = 1.8 ms for ACh and τ0 = 2.5 ms for nicotine. 6. Raising the external calcium concentration from 5 to 50 mM shifted the reversal potential of the ACh-induced current from +4.6 ± 0.9 to +37.3 ± 1.3 mV. The calcium-to-sodium permeability ratio (P(Ca):P(Na)) was 6.4. 7.

Each MB contains approximately 110 GABA- immunoreactive neurons, and approximately 50% of them are feedback neurons, i.e., they connect the MB output regions - the α-lobe, β-lobe, and pedunculus - with its input regions - the calyces. Their somata are located in the lateral protocerebral lobe, and their primary neurites project medially and bifurcate near the α-lobe. In the α-lobe feedback neurons form narrow banded, horizontal arborizations in the dorsal and median α-lobe; each cell innervates a certain α-lobe layer. The neurons form additional branches in the pedunculus and the β-lobe. All calycal subcompartments - the lip, collar, and basal ring - are innervated by feedback neurons. However, individual feedback neurons innervate exclusively a certain subcompartment in both the median and lateral calyx. Due to the arrangement of intrinsic Kenyon cells, each calycal subcompartment is connected to its specific, corresponding layer in the α-lobe. Feedback neurons interconnect the α- lobe and the calyces in either a corresponding or a noncorresponding fashion. With respect to their branching pattern in the α-lobe, the basal ring and the collar neuropil receive input from feedback neurons innervating the corresponding dorsal and median α-lobe layers. By contrast, the lip region, which receives olfactory antennal input, is innervated by feedback neurons with arborizations in a noncorresponding dorsal α-lobe layer.","Cobalt hexamine chloride; Inhibitory feedback neurons; Insects; Neuroanatomy; Protocerebrum",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344096568

As a photoreceptor transmitter, histamine acts on ligand-gated chloride channels. Another type of histamine receptor has been indicated in the insect central nervous system by binding pharmacology. This receptor is similar to the mammalian H 1 receptors, which are G-protein coupled and thus utilize a second messenger system. The distribution of histamine- immunoreactive (HAIR) neurons has been studied in a few insect species: cockroaches, locust, crickets, honey bee, blowflies, and in Drosophila. In addition to its presence in photoreceptor cells, histamine is distributed in a rather small number of neurons in the insect brain. Many of these neurons have extensive bilateral arborizations that innervate several distinct neuropil regions, notably in the protocerebrum. Some patterns of histamine distribution are seen in all the species. On the other hand, the number and morphology of neurons differ between the studied species, and several major neuropils (central body, antennal lobes, mushroom bodies) are supplied by HAIR neurons in some species, but not in others. Thus it appears that there are some species-specific functions of histamine and on others that are preserved between species. Some of the histaminergic neurons may constitute wide field inhibitory systems with functions distinct from those of neurons containing γ-amino butyric acid (GABA). Novel data are presented for Drosophila and the cockroach Leucophaea maderae and a comparison is made with published data on other insects.","Histamine receptor; Insect central nervous system; Monoamine; Neuroanatomy",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2542509911

Both cypermethrin and fenitrothion led to a significant hypoglucosemia and hypotrehalosemia 15 min after injection, but cypermethrin seemed more active than fenitrothion at the same doses. A recovery phase appeared for glucosemia and trehalosemia, 60 min after injection. The higher toxicity of cypermethrin than fenitrothion also appeared in this period, where it took a longer time for honeybees to reestablish carbohydrate levels following cypermethrin than fenitrothion injections. The low values of the correlation coefficients (r) for glucose versus trehalose levels led to the supposition that no typical functional interaction between glucose and trehalose could be considered to be involved in this experience.

Mating data from a number of different Apis species and subspecies are needed to help explain polyandry in honey bees. Pupae of four colonies of Apis mellifera sicula from Sicily were genotyped on three polymorphic microsatellite loci. The genotypes of the queens and fathering drones from these colonies were deduced from the genotypes of the pupae. We found no evidence for polygyny, at least we can exclude more than one functional queen, even super-sister queens, if maternity contributions are equal. The four queens mated with at least 5 to 12 (mean: 9.3 ± 3.0 SE) drones. We estimate the error in our determination of the mating frequency that is caused by limited genetic resolution of the marker loci to be less than 1 mating given that Hardy-Weinberg assumptions are satisfied. However, the drones the single queens mated with may be a non-random sample of the whole population, so that detection error may be more severe. The average pedigree relatedness among workers within the colonies was estimated to be 0.341. These results are within the range of those found in other A. mellifera subspecies and Apis species except A. dorsata.

At times of no food income, they stayed mostly in the broodnest and on the food stores, and were inactive 70% of the time, which might save energy for the colony; they did not take over any duties from other temporal castes. A pronounced day and night rhythm in food-storer behaviour was recorded only when there was a nectar flow.

In colonies of its original Asian host, Apis cerana, the mites invade both drone and worker brood cells, but reproduce only in drone cells. Absence of reproduction in worker cells is probably crucial for the tolerance of A. cerana towards V. jacobsoni because it implies that the mite population can only grow during periods in which drones are reared. To test if nonreproduction of V. jacobsoni in worker brood cells of A. cerana is due to a trait of the mites or of the honey-bee species, mites from bees in A. mellifera colonies were artificially introduced into A. cerana worker brood cells and vice versa. Approximately 80% of the mites from A. mellifera colonies reproduced in naturally infested worker cells as well as when introduced into worker cells of A. mellifera and A. cerana. Conversely, only 10% of the mites from A. cerana colonies reproduced, both in naturally infested worker cells of A. cerana and when introduced into worker cells of A. mellifera. Hence, absence of reproduction in worker cells is due to a trait of the mites. Additional experiments showed that A. cerana bees removed 84% of the worker brood that was artificially infested with mites from A. mellifera colonies. Brood removal started 2 days after artificial infestation, which suggests that the bees responded to behaviour of the mites. Since removal behaviour of the bees will have a large impact on fitness of the mites, it probably plays an important role in selection for differential reproductive strategies. Our findings have large implications for selection programmes to breed less-susceptible bee strains. If differences in nonreproduction are mite specific, we should not only look for non-reproduction as such, but for colonies in which non-reproduction in worker cells is selected. Hence, in selection programmes fitness of mites that reproduce in both drone and worker cells should be compared to fitness of mites that reproduce only in drone cells.","Apis cerana; Apis mellifera; Honey-bee; Parasite, reproductive strategy; Selection programme; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032913923

The highest frequency of split sting was detected in workers treated at the pink-eyed pupal phase. The lowest frequency was observed in the bees treated at the oldest worker pupal phase studied (brown-eyed pupae with lightly pigmented cuticle). Both queen pupal phases tested (white and pink-eyed pupae) were equally sensitive and produced high percentages of adults with split sting. However, the 20°C treatment of workers and queens, at the different pupal phases, resulted in high frequencies of adults with deformed wings. Also, fewer workers and queens treated at the earlier pupal stages reached adult emergence.

The Hsp70, Hsp90 and histone protein distribution patterns are discussed in relation to the morphological, cytochemical and immunocytochemical characteristics of programmed cell death and pathological necrosis. Results produced by methyl green-pyronin staining confirm an elevation of RNA levels in normal programmed cell death and a reduced staining for RNA in necrotic infected cells.","Anti-histone; Apis mellifera; Heat-shock; Honeybee larvae; Immunohistochemistry; Midgut; Paenibacillus larvae (Bacillus larvae)",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033101651

The effects of ingested biogenic amine precursors 5-hydroxytryptophan, L-DOPA and tryptophan were tested on three variables measurable from the sound traces: onset of the buzzing response after presentation of the pheromone stimulus, the duration of the buzzing event, and the maximal sound frequency produced during the buzzing event. Bees fed high doses of 5-hydroxytryptophan were found to react significantly more slowly and with a significantly lower maximum frequency than bees that were only fed sucrose controls. Bees fed DOPA were no different from controls for any of the variables measured, and bees fed tryptophan were so hyperactive that reliable responses to the presentation of alarm pheromone could not be made. Finally, the brains of worker bees fed these different precursors were examined for content of various neurochemicals. Bees fed 5-hydroxytryptophan were found to have dose-dependent elevations of both 5-hydroxytryptophan and serotonin within their brains. Bees fed tryptophan were found to have dose-dependent elevations of tryptophan and kynurenine in the brain but no change in brain serotonin. Bees fed DOPA had dose-dependent increases in DOPA and dopamine levels within their brains. These results suggest that the hyperactive condition results from kynurenine metabolism, and the reduced response to alarm pheromone is related to serotonin metabolism.","5-hydroxytryptophan; Alarm pheromones; Biogenic amines; Honey bees; Kynurenine; L-DOPA; Tryptophan",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032872513

Ten European and 10 Africanized parental colonies (generation P; groups 1and 2, respectively) were selected in accordance with their morphometrics and subjective evaluation of their behaviour in the field. These colonies were tested for three traits of defensiveness using a standard protocol. Colonies' worker morphometrics and worker cell dimensions were also measured. After the P generation colonies were tested, queens were removed and colonies were allowed to requeen themselves. The virgin queens of the following generation (F1) were allowed to mate freely and, six months later, colonies were again tested. This procedure of mother-daughter queen replacement and testing of colonies was performed two more times (F2 and F3 generations). Wilcoxon- Mann-Whitney tests and Pearson's correlation analysis were used to test for differences between groups in defensive and morphological traits and to determine the relationship between traits in each generation. The results of this study showed that individual colonies dramatically changed their worker morphometrics and defensive behaviour from one generation to the next. However, all colonies, whether originally Africanized or European, came to resemble more the Africanized type across subsequent generations. Correlations between morphometrics and defensive behaviour were not always consistent. Although morphometrics might still be a reliable method for quick identification of colonies it seems that defensive behaviour alone may provide an inadequate trait by which to discriminate among neotropical honey bee types, especially Africanized-European hybrid colonies. © 1999 International Bee Research Association.","Africanization; Africanized honey bees; Apis mellifera; Behaviour; Defence; Morphology; Morphometrics; Multivariate analysis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033441120

Previous work with this apparatus has found discrimination between two patterns of coloured gratings or radial sectors that are fixed in different orientations during the training. When there was contrast to the blue receptors alone, gratings of period 6° were resolved, and 4° when there was contrast to the green receptors. In the present work, bees discriminate between a pattern containing tangentially arranged edges and one containing radially arranged edges, both with no average edge orientation. The targets were rotated every 5 min to make the locations of areas useless as cues. The edges remained consistently radial or tangential and were therefore the only cues. Tests with patterns of selected colours and various levels of grey show that for each colour there is a level of grey at which discrimination fails. Discrimination is therefore colour-blind. The same patterns were made with combinations of coloured papers that give no contrast to the green receptors or alternatively to the blue receptors. The bees discriminate only if the edges between colours present a contrast to the green receptors. The system that discriminates generalized radial and tangential cues is therefore colour blind because the inputs are restricted to the green receptors, not because receptor outputs are added together. The same result was obtained with a very coarse pattern of period 20°.","Apis mellifera; Colour-blind; Honeybee vision; Radial/tangential cues",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0008538166

However, there was a major difference between the percentage of mother mites producing viable adult female offspring (AHB = 40%, EHB = 75%). This was caused by the increased rate of mite offspring mortality suffered by the first (male) and second (female) offspring in AHB worker cells.

Although clinical symptoms indicated the presence of some of the viruses of bees in Hungary, none have previously been isolated or identified. During July unusual adult bee and brood mortality was observed in some colonies of an apiary in Budapest known to be infested with Varroa jacobsoni. Large amounts of acute paralysis virus (APV) were detected serologically in healthy honey bee pupae killed by the injection of a bacteria-free extract of diseased adult bees. Crystalline arrays of 30 nm particles were seen in ultrathin sections of the tissues of injected pupae and naturally infected adult bees. In spite of the application of acaricide treatments the bee population in several colonies had collapsed by the end of summer and the apiary suffered severe wintering losses.","Acute paralysis virus; Honey bee; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032609988

The attractiveness of virgin queen tergal gland secretions and queen mandibular pheromone to worker honeybees was tested using a retinue bioassay. The number of workers attending the treated pseudoqueen lures was videorecorded in order to allow for the quantification of attractiveness. Queen mandibular gland secretions were more attractive than tergal gland secretions (P≤ 0.008), and both queen tergal gland secretions (P≤ 0.0002) and mandibular gland secretions (P≤0.0001) were significantly more attractive than the control treatment.

In many fruit and vegetable crops, the number of bee visitations can be the limiting step in obtaining optimal yield. Increasing the attractiveness of flowers to honeybees could, therefore, provide a useful means of improving fruit yield and seed production. Genetic variability in attractiveness to honeybees was found within the genus Citrullus. The number of daily visits per flower ranged from six to 12 among cultivars. Moreover, most of the visits to the more attractive cultivars occurred in the first hour of bee activity, whereas visits to the less attractive cultivars started later in the morning. A positive relationship was found between the frequency of bee visitations and seed number per fruit. Analyses of floral attributes indicated no genetic variability in flower size, amount of pollen grains, or nectar volume; however, differences were observed in the concentration of sucrose and total sugars in the nectar. A positive relationship was found between attractiveness to bees and nectar sugar concentration, suggesting that this characteristic is one of the parameters responsible for variability in attractiveness to honeybees.","Nectar; Seed set; Sugar concentration; Watermelon",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032884435

The behaviour of pairs of bees, one (donor) fed with 50-μl sucrose solutions and another unfed recipient, was analysed as a function of the sucrose concentration, the concentration at constant viscosity (kept constant by adding tylose, an inert polysaccharide), and of the viscosity of a 30% sucrose solution. By increasing the concentration of solutions, the rate at which the solution was transferred to recipient bees (transfer rate of solution, in μl/s) increased up to a maximum value for 30% sucrose solution, and decreased beyond this concentration (concentration experiment). At constant viscosity, no modulation was observed for the lower sugar concentration range (10-30%), while the transfer rate of solution clearly increased beyond 30% (concentration experiment at constant viscosity). For the 30% sucrose solution, the transfer rate decreased with increasing viscosity (viscosity experiment). If only the sucrose compound is comparatively analysed, the transfer rate of sucrose (in mg/s) increased similarly in the first two experiments. These results give behavioural evidence suggesting that donor bees are capable of modulating the trophallactic food transfer as related tO the sucrose concentrations carried into their crops within a considerable wide range, but viscosity prevents it. It also suggests that trophallactic transfer rate does not depend on abdominal volume, for even when all donor bees attained similar loads (50 μl), transfer rate of solution increased along with the offered sucrose concentration.

The type and the amount of damage to immature and adult mites differed considerably. Protection of the bottom board against predators significantly reduced the extent of damaged mites. Mites should not remain on the bottom board for longer than 2 days, because the extent of damage increases significantly after that, especially when wax moth larvae are present.

There is a strong prima facie argument, and some supporting evidence, that introduced honeybees are likely to adversely affect the environment. Some land management agencies have consequently adopted a policy of removal of hive honeybees from areas devoted primarily to conservation. On the other hand, some argue that the scientific evidence on the issue remains poor, point out the economic benefits that arise from the honeybee industry and suggest that removal of apiaries from such areas is unjustified. It is suggested in this paper that adoption of the Precautionary Principle could significantly reduce this conflict. Instead of the focus being on obtaining definitive ""proof"" concerning possible impacts of honeybees, it could shift to finding ways to reduce the density of feral honeybees, and hence their impacts on both the natural environment and honeybees in hives. The focus could also shift to finding sites where reduction in honeybee density is feasible and the likely conservation gains arising from such a reduction are relatively high.

In particular, the consequences of reduced intracolonial relatedness provide plausible explanations for multiple mating with up to ten drones, but fail to account for the much higher mating frequencies observed in nature. In this paper, we propose an alternative mechanism which builds on non-linear relationships between intracolonial frequencies in genotypic worker specialization and colony fitness. If genes for any worker specialization confer an advantage on colony fitness only when they are rare, this would require a stable mix of sperm from a few drones which contribute that trait, and many which do not. To ensure both specific, low within-colony proportions of 'rare specialist' genes, and to reduce random variation of these proportions would require mating with high numbers of drones. The quantitative implementation shows that moderate to very high numbers of matings are required to exploit colony advantages from genotypic allocation of workers to rare tasks. Extreme polyandry thus could result from colony selection dependent on the intracolonial frequency of rare genetic specialists.","Apis mellifera; Division of labor; Evolution; Polyandry; Social insects; Task allocation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032950151

In the Cape honeybee (A. m. capensis) reproductive workers lay fertilised eggs which develop into females. In this case the average worker relatedness to sexual reproductives reared from worker or queen offspring is identical.

Such concerns include the possible depletion of nectar resources by honeybees to the detriment of native animals and the ability of honeybees to pollinate Australian plants. The foraging patterns and resource utilization of honeybees (Apis mellifera) and native insects on flowers of yellow Mallee (Eucalyptus costata) (Behr & F. Muell, ex F. Muell.) were studied in Wyperfeld National Park during spring 1994. Seventy-four insect species visited the flowers with the most prevalent being honeybees, native bees (Lasioglossum and Hylaeus) and ants (Iridiomyrmex). Honeybees began foraging at lower temperatures than native bees and hence had initial access to the nectar supply that was primarily produced overnight by E. costata. However, the majority (90%) of early morning visits to flowers by honeybees involved the collection of pollen. Honeybees did not forage for nectar in substantial numbers until after native insects were active. Despite both consumption and evaporation, nectar supplies remained available at midday and at one site remained available for consumption at dusk. Honeybees regularly made contact with the receptive stigmata while foraging for pollen and hence had pollen loads consisting of numerous E. costata grains present on their body. These activities are indicative of the behaviour required by insects to facilitate pollination. Given the unique morphology of many native flowers and the contrasting findings from studies to date, it is critical that generalisations about the effect of honeybees in the Australian environment are not made from studies on a limited number of native plant species.","Eucalypt; Foraging; Honeybee; Myrtaceae; Nectar; Pollen; Pollination",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-18044398268

Multi-infestation is frequently observed in worker brood and can be interpreted as an aggregative phenomenon. The aim of this study was to determine whether the distribution of V. jacobsoni in worker brood cells relies on a random or an aggregative process. We studied the distribution of Varroa females in capped worker brood at similar age by comparing, by a Monte Carlo test, the observed frequency distribution of mites per cell to simulated distributions based on a random process. A complementary approach, using the 'nearest neighbor distances' (NND) with Monte Carlo tests, was investigated to study the spatial distribution (a) between mites in different cells and (b) between infested cells in brood. The observed distributions did not differ significantly from that expected by a random process, and we conclude that there is no aggregation during invasion of V. jacobsoni in worker brood.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032716888

Two methods were used to ensure unequivocal identification of cells as antennal motor neurons: 1) selective backfilling of the neurons with fluorescent markers before dissociation for cell culture or before recording from cells in intact brains, semiintact brains, or in brain slices or 2) staining with a fluorescent marker via the patch pipette during recordings and identifying antennal motor neurons in situ on the basis of their characteristic morphology. Four voltage-activated currents were isolated in these antennal motor neurons with pharmacological, voltage, and ion substitution protocols. The neurons expressed at least two distinct K+ currents, a transient current (I(A)) that was blocked by 4-aminopyridine (4- 5 x 10-3 M), and a sustained current (I(K(V)) that was partially blocked by tetraethylammonium (2-3 x 10-2 M) and quinidine (5 x 10-5 M). I(A) activated above -40 to -30 mV and the half-maximal voltages for steady-state activation and inactivation were -8.8 and -43.2 mV, respectively. I(K(V)) activated above -50 to -40 mV and the midpoint of the steady-state activation curve was +11.2 mV. I(K(V)) did not show steady-state inactivation. Additionally, two inward currents were isolated: a tetrodotoxin (10-7 M)- sensitive, transient Na+ current (I(Na)) that activated above -35 mV, with a maximum around -5 mV and a half-maximal voltage for inactivation of -72.6 mV, and a CdCl2 (5 x 10-5 M)-sensitive Ca2+ current that activated above - 45 to -40 mV, with a maximum around -15 mV.

Those environmental differences should select for heterogeneity in forager flower fidelity among honey bee subspecies, particularly when reward frequency differences are associated with competing flower types. We tested that evolutionary model by examining the foraging behaviour of Africanized honey bees (AHB), and by comparing our observations with those recorded for Italian (A. m. ligustica) and Caucasian honey bees (A. m. caucasica). The response of AHB (A. m. scutel- lata hybrid/introgressant) to reward frequency differences among flower colours was examined using artificial flower patches. Each patch contained blue, white, and yellow flowers. When rewards offered by all three flower- morphs were identical, some foragers restricted visitation to blue and white flowers, while others showed fidelity to yellow flowers. Bees visiting blue and white flowers did not show a preference for either the blue or white colour morph under those conditions. However, forager behaviour changed when they were presented with different reward frequencies associated with the alternative flower colours. Bees frequenting blue and white flowers favoured blue when it offered a reward more frequently than white, and favoured white when the reverse was true. That behaviour occurred not only when the more frequently rewarding flower colour offered a higher harvest rate, but also when harvest rates obtained from all flower colours were equal. A change in flower colour fidelity involving yellow vs. blue and white flowers was observed only when reward frequency difference was linked to maximizing harvest rate. Those results contrast sharply to reported A. m. ligustica and A. m. caucasica honey bee behaviour: neither Italian nor Caucasian bees respond to reward frequency differences among flower colours, even between blue and white flowers. © 1999 International Bee Research Association.","Africanized honey bees; Apis mellifera caucasica; Apis mellifera ligustica; Apis mellifera scutellata; Flower colour; Foraging; Foraging constancy; Reward frequency",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033262707

Mitochondrial genotype is highly correlated with morphology. Ninety-five percent of morphometrically determined Africanized feral colonies collected in Texas, Arizona, California, and Mexico also contained African mitochondria. Sixty-two percent of colonies from commercial or minimally managed apiaries in Mexico and Central America, with Africanized forewing lengths and 17% of colonies with intermediate forewing lengths, had African mitochondria. The strong correlation between non-European morphology and African mitotype, as well as the speed and accuracy of mitotype determination, suggest a 3-step Africanized bee identification procedure. This identification procedure first examines forewing length. Bees with lengths above a given threshold (9.12 mm) have a very high probability of being pure European in origin and are not examined further. Those bees with wing lengths below the threshold are subjected to mitochondrial analysis (mitotyping). Samples having African mitochondria are not examined further. Those bees with small forewing lengths, but European mitotypes, are then identified using detailed morphometric discriminant function analysis. By performing these steps in sequence, the number of bees requiring full morphometric analysis is reduced, saving time and improving the accuracy of Africanized honey bee identification.","Africanized honey bees; Apis mellifera scutellata; Mitochondrial genotype; Morphometrics; Race identification",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032822384

Approximately 20 % of the reproducing mite population can be eliminated by entombing of lethally parasitized drone pupae. In their equally effective infesting behaviour the parasites explore the most suitable adult and larval host individuals for safe phoretic positions, the favourable caste and suitable age.

Adult female mites obtained from honeybee pupae naturally infected with DWV contained virus titers many times in excess of those found in their hosts and, beyond that, which might be expected from a concentration effect. It is therefore possible that DWV may be capable of replicating withinV. jacobsoni.Bees which tested positive for DWV exhibited characteristic morphological deformity and/or they died during pupation. Asymptomatic bees had much lower virus titers than those which were deformed or had died during pupation. It is therefore suggested that for DWV to cause pathology it must be present in pupae above a certain concentration. The amount of DWV vectored byV. jacobsoniwill depend on the mites' level of infection, which will in turn depend on whether they had fed previously on dead or deformed bees and also on the rate of replication of the virus within the mites. Consequently, developing bees infested with large numbers of mites could suffer a high incidence of deformity if the mites are heavily infected or harbor an especially virulent strain of virus. A positive relationship was found between increasing numbers of mites on individual bees and the incidence of morphological deformity and death. This probably reflected the large number of viral particles transmitted by the mites, which resulted in many multiply infested bees dying before emergence. These results demonstrate the importance of the role of viruses when considering the pathology ofV. jacobsoniand that much of the pathology previously associated with the effects of mite feeding could be attributed directly to secondary pathogens vectored byV. jacobsoni. © 1999 Academic Press.","Apis mellifera; Bee death; Bee deformity; Deformed wing virus; Disease transmission; Honeybees; Varroa jacobsoni; Vector",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001387643

Research is reviewed on hygienic and grooming behaviors with respect to their potential as mechanisms of resistance to V. jacobsoni. Studies related to hygienic behavior include the removal of experimentally infested and naturally infested brood, measurements of heritability, the uncapping and recapping of cells containing infested pupae, and the detection of infested brood. Studies on grooming include the process by which a groomer detects and damages a mite found on itself or on another adult bee, how the behavior is quantified, and problems with these methods of quantification.

P1 and P2 are the initial and final mite populations, a is population change while mites are in brood cells, b is population change outside brood cells and n is the number of reproductive cycles of the mite. By comparing the growth of mite populations in each colony (P2/P1), one can determine which bees are more resistant to mites. The values of a, b and n provide details about the growth of the mite population by identifying which portion of the mite's reproductive cycle was affected. Selection should be based on specific characteristics of bees rather than on general changes in mite populations. When specific characteristics of bees affect different components of the reproductive cycle of the mite, it may be possible to combine the characteristics to produce bees that are more resistant to mites.","Apis mellifera; Mite; Resistant population; Selective breeding; Varroa jacobsoni",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033008417

We repeated Lindauer's observations of swarms choosing future home sites but used modern videorecording and bee-labelling techniques to produce a finer-grained description of the decision-making process than was possible 40 years ago. Our results both confirm Lindauer's findings and reveal several new features of the decision-making process. Viewing the process at the group level, we found: (1) the scout bees in a swarm find potential nest sites in all directions and at distances of up to several kilometers; (2) initially, the scouts advertise a dozen or more sites with their dances on the swarm, but eventually they advertise just one site; (3) within about an hour of the appearance of unanimity among the dancers, the swarm lifts off to fly to the chosen site; (4) there is a crescendo of dancing just before liftoff, and (5) the chosen site is not necessarily the one that is first advertised on the swarm. Viewing the process at the individual level, we found: (1) the dances of individual scout bees tend to taper off and eventually cease, so that many dancers drop out each day; (2) some scout bees switch their allegiance from one site to another, and (3) the principal means of consensus building among the dancing bees is for bees that dance initially for a non-chosen site to cease their dancing altogether, not to switch their dancing to the chosen site. We hypothesize that scout bees are programmed to gradually quit dancing and that this reduces the possibility of the decision-making process coming to a standstill with groups of unyielding dancers deadlocked over two or more sites. We point out that a swarm's overall strategy of decision making is a 'weighted additive strategy.' This strategy is the most accurate but also the most demanding in terms of information processing, because it takes account of all of the information relevant to a decision problem. Despite being composed of small-brained bees, swarms are able to use the weighted additive strategy by distributing among many bees both the task of evaluating the alternative sites and the task of identifying the best of these sites.","Apis mellifer; Communication; Dance language; Decision making; Swarming",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032920848

Trapping with worker brood is labour intensive because a large amount of brood is needed to trap a sufficient number of mites for effective control. In addition, trapping with worker brood requires subsequent treatment of the capped brood to selectively kill the mites, because beekeepers want to save the brood. Trapping with drone brood demands fewer brood cells for effective mite control, and destruction of drone brood with trapped mites is common practice. Moreover, preparation of trap-combs with drone brood can be integrated into swarm-prevention techniques and will take little extra time.","Apis mellifera; Biotechnical control; Model; Trap-combs; Varroa jacobsoni",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032975535

In arena experiments, young drones - comparable to young workers - show a more significant preference for higher temperature than older ones. This corresponds with the behaviour in large colonies during nighttime, when there is a pronounced temperature gradient from the center to the margin. This affects drones as well as workers; hence younger bees prefer to be in the broodnest. During daytime, when only bees not being on the wing were taken into account, no significant age dependent temperature preference was found in the colony. The presence of nurse bees in the arena, which frequently offer food, shift the drones' preference towards that of the nurse bees.

We compared honey bee (Apis mellifera) foraging activity and melon nectar characteristics in well-ventilated and in closed greenhouses. Foraging activity in the open greenhouses was two- to five-fold greater than that in the closed greenhouses. This higher activity could be explained by higher flower attractivity due to a higher nectar sugar concentration both in hermaphroditic flowers and male flowers. The higher sugar concentration in the open, ventilated greenhouses was probably as a result of the relatively lower humidity there. The greater foraging activity in the open greenhouses also may have been due to lower air temperatures and better accessibility for the bees.

Trapping is most efficient using drone brood in otherwise broodless colonies. In theory, one trap-comb with drone brood is enough to achieve control. We designed and tested two methods using trap-combs with drone brood. In the first experiment, effectiveness of the control method varied considerably, from 67% to 96%. However, the observed effectiveness in each separate colony was similar to the prediction based on knowledge of behaviour of mites invading brood cells. Effectiveness depended on the number of drone cells that had been available for mite trapping. In the second experiment, we adjusted the method to improve production of trap-combs with drone brood, since this appeared to be crucial for trapping efficiency. The observed effectiveness of 93.4% demonstrates that trap-combs with drone brood can effectively trap mites, thereby offering a non-chemical method of varroa control.

Nonreproductive mites were classified into 3 groups as follows: (1) mites that were alive but did not lay eggs, (2) mites that began laying eggs later than normal, and (3) mites that died before laying eggs (usually <2% of mites in worker brood). Mites that did not lay any eggs had significantly fewer spermatozoa (4 ± 8 [mean ± SD] n = 33) in their seminal receptacle than normally reproductive mites (27 ± 14, n = 45). About half of the mites that produced no progeny had no spermatozoa in their seminal receptacles. Hence, the failure to produce progeny was related to fertilization of the female mite. Reproductive mites produced fewer progeny in colonies that had a higher proportion of nonreproductive mites.

At least two mechanisms could account for the observed differences in queen and worker broods. First, kin selection theory predicts that if honeybee workers are able to distinguish levels of relatedness, they should act nepotistically by favouring super-sisters over less-related half-sisters during emergency queen rearing. Alternatively, selection might result in royalty alleles that make their possessors more favoured for rearing as queens. Documented genetically based tendencies to rear queen or worker brood might interact with either of these mechanisms. To determine which of these effects might best explain reproductive dominance, we removed brood from the queenright section of one colony and offered it to the queenless section of the same colony and to three unrelated queenless colonies. We used two microsatellite loci to determine the paternity of queen and worker brood reared by these colonies. Variance in the proportions of subfamilies in queen and worker brood was greatest when the rearing bees were related to the brood. The results suggest that nepotistic interactions are more important than royalty alleles or other factors in causing reproductive dominance, but that there are complex interactions between the genotype of the nursing workers, and the genotypes of the larvae favoured for rearing as queens.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032796566

We conditioned each subject to turn its head and extend its proboscis towards one of two presented odours; one odour was associated with a constant reward volume and the other with a variable reward volume that was either low or high, with probabilities P=0.75 and (1 - P)=0.25, respectively. The volumes of rewards were varied among three experimental conditions. In conditions I and II, the variable reward option included a low reward of zero (i.e. reinforcement was withheld in the low reward value); in condition I, the mean of the variable and of the constant reward options were the same, and in condition II, the variable reward option had a higher mean reward than the constant reward option. The behaviour of subjects did not differ between treatments and the majority of individuals were risk averse. In condition III, the variable reward option did not include a zero reward and the mean reward did not differ between options. Very few of the individuals assigned to condition III developed a preference for either reward option. Thus, honeybees are risk sensitive to variability in volume of reward in some conditions and the degree of risk sensitivity depends on characteristics of the reward distributions. The most salient characteristic may be a relative measure of variability, such as the value of the coefficient of variation, of reward. The experimental paradigm that we developed is a powerful tool for studying the mechanism of risk sensitivity in bees, as well as other aspects of learning, decision making, perception and memory.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033135120

To do so, we fitted a simple device, which we call a hive-entrance pollen transfer device, at the hive entrance. The device was lined with three materials which were tested for their efficiency in increasing pollen grain numbers and pollen richness on the bodies of honey bees departing their colony in the summer of 1993. Of the three materials, woollen fabric and felt fabric increased significantly the total number of pollen grains on bees by an average of 84% and 131%, respectively. The effect of fine nylon bristles on pollen grain numbers, though positive (14% increase), was only marginally significant relative to control colonies. Felt fabric performed better than woollen fabric and fine nylon bristles in increasing significantly pollen richness on departing bees (by 64%, 25% and 28%, respectively). Germination of pollen sampled from the bodies of bees departing a colony with a hive-entrance pollen transfer device lined with fine bristles and a control colony was found to be similar, and not significantly different from pollen sampled from the bodies of pollen collectors entering the same colonies. Among bees' body areas, proboscidial fossae carried pollen with the highest germination rate. Corbicular pollen had almost twice as high a germination as that from proboscidial fossae.

The response of stingless bees to these factors is not known. Therefore, we studied the response of Melipona beecheii to experimental pollen deprivation, worker loss and controlled information input. Following pollen stress M. beecheii did not increase its forager force, but allocated more foragers to pollen foraging. There was an indication that individual foraging was intensified. During the first 10 days after the reduction of the pollen reserve, pollen availability in the field was low and pollen foraging almost stopped. The increase in pollen foraging occurred after these 10 days. M. beecheii did not respond to daily variation in worker mortality or experimentally induced 50% worker loss. Behaviour of pollen foragers was related to previous day foraging experience and not to colony foraging parameters such as the total number of pollen loads and the size of the work force. More foragers were allocated to pollen foraging when more information on pollen availability (returning successful foragers) came into the hive. This study indicates that in M. beecheii the allocation of foragers to pollen collecting depends both on the availability of pollen sources and on colony needs. Their response to pollen stress was similar to that reported for Apis mellifera, except for the more conservative response to low pollen availability in the environment. This conservative reaction may be typical for stingless bees, that due to the mass provisioning of brood cells, do not suffer immediate brood loss when pollen is lacking. © 1999 International Bee Research Association.","Communication; Costa Rica; Division of labour; Melipona beecheii; Meliponinae; Pollen foraging; Pollen stress; Stingless bees; Worker loss",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033442225

Six trees of each cultivar received six pollination treatments: three cross-pollen sources, self-pollination, bagging and bagging with emasculation. Pollen tube growth, percentage fruit set, fruit weight, seediness, sugar and acid content were assessed in all treatments. Significant xenia effects, including effects on sugar content, were found in all cultivars. 'Imperial' was found to be self-incompatible as self-pollen tubes were inhibited in the upper style. This resulted in a lower fruit set in self-pollinated fruits (P<0.01), a very low fruit weight (33-55 g, compared with 92-103 g, P<0.01), and fruits containing few or no seeds. In addition, 'Ellenor' and 'Murcott' pollen significantly increased sugar content of fruit by between 0.9-1.6% compared with self-pollinated and unpollinated treatments (P<0.05). Widespread problems of variable production and poor fruit quality in 'Imperial' may be alleviated by interplanting with appropriate pollen sources such as 'Ellenor' and 'Murcott'. Pollen source significantly affected fruit set, seed number and sugar content but not fruit weight of cv. Ellenor. In particular, 'Murcott' pollen produced a significantly higher fruit set, relatively low seed number, and the highest mean sugar content (13.2%), significantly higher than 'Imperial' pollen, bagged, and unpollinated treatments (>12.5%: P<0.01). Fruit production, seediness and sugar content of 'Ellenor' mandarin may be improved by interplanting with 'Murcott'. Cross-pollination significantly increased seed number of 'Murcott' (15-21 seeds per fruit, compared with 13-17 seeds per fruit, P<0.01). 'Murcott' could be planted in pure blocks since self-pollinated 'Murcott' fruit had slightly ~fewer seeds than crosses, without any significant loss of size or quality.

Each unit consists of an outer tepal opposed to a broad style branch terminating in prominent paired crests, together forming a gullet-like unit. However, many species in this genus of some 200 species have mechanically protandrous flowers in which the three stamens form a sheath surrounding the style and the style branches are narrow, with reduced stigmatic crests, and the subequal inner and outer tepal whorls form a shallow or deep bowl sometimes fully enclosing the stamens and style branches. The flowers secrete hexose-dominant nectar and, except for M. collina, are self-incompatible. Flowers of the nine species in two sections studied comprise two different modes of pollination based on the presentation of the staminal column and perianth, pigmentation, scent, and edible rewards. In five species, M. collina, M. comptonii, M. elegans, M. ochroleuca, and M. vallisbelli, the perianth forms a wide or narrow bowl and produces strong, sweet or musk-like odors, and the weakly diverging anthers are appressed to the narrow, inconspicuous style branches. These flowers are pollinated primarily by flower flies, scarab beetles, and honey bees that land on the perianth and brush against the anthers and/or receptive stigmas while foraging for nectar or pollen, or in the case or beetles merely assembling on the flowers. In the second group of species, M. bifida, M. miniata, M. pseudospicata, and M. reflexa, the perianth is stellate, pink, yellow, or blue, usually without discernable scent, the filaments are united into a column that is exserted from the flower, and the anthers are usually coherent. These flowers are pollinated primarily by polylectic bees in the families Apidae (Anthophora diversipes, Apis mellifera) and Melittidae (Rediviva spp.). The bees land on the staminal column and forage for pollen, sometimes later moving onto the perianth to take nectar present at the base of the tepals. The columns of these species are interpreted as both morphological and functional intermediates between pollen presenters or protostigmas (e.g., in Asterales, Campanulales, Proteales) and true gynostemia/gynostegia (in Asclepiadaceae, Orohidaceae, and Stylidiaceae). These flowers represent a profound shift in the ancestral pollination strategy in the genus from one of passive pollen deposition on bees foraging for nectar on meranthia to one of active foraging for nectar or pollen on whole flowers.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032949236

Queenless workers at different ages (≤12 h, and 4, 8, and 21 d) were tested in cages for ovarian development. Newly emerged, 4- and 8-d-old, and 21-d-old workers had medium-, and small-sized ovaries, respectively, suggesting that of the worker ages tested only 4- and 8-d-old workers are likely to become egg layers in a queenless colony. Also, we compared ovarian ovarian development of newly emerged workers that were caged for 14 d and allowed to consume either pollen or royal jelly to that of another group of workers similarly caged but screened so that they could only obtain food via trophallaxis from young bees. Ovaries of newly emerged workers that received food from young bees were as well developed as those of newly emerged workers allowed to take pollen or royal jelly directly. Screened workers also had lower but still elevated vitellogenin levels compared with bees having direct access to food. These results indicate that nurse-age bees functioning as pollen-digesting units affect the ovarian development of other workers and to a lesser extent vitellogenesis via food exchange. We compared the influence of group sizes of 25, 125, and 600 bees per cage on ovarian development for 14 d. The two groups of 25 and 125 bees had similar mean ovary scores, and higher scores than a group of 600 bees. Our findings suggest that nurse-age bees could play an important role in mediating worker fertility via trophallaxis, possibly by differentiating worker dominance status, and generally only young workers become fertile when a queen is lost in a colony. Vitellogenin is a more sensitive parameter to measure bee fertility, and might be a useful tool to further explore ovary development and egg laying in worker social insects. We recommend measuring haemolymph vitellogenin titres and (or) oocyte length of workers in a group of 25 bees per cage, supplied with 50% royal jelly in honey as a standard method to assess honey bee worker fertility in future experiments.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032851279

Only nests in an exposed nesting environment had a long vestibulum, whereas nests protected from sun and temperature fluctuations (within a honey bee hive body) had short vestibuli or none at all. The rate of parasitism of the first cell from nests with a vestibulum did not differ from nests without a vestibulum in both nesting environments. The short vestibulum built by O. tufa in protected nests probably represents the remaining space of a nest hole that is too short for an additional cell. Nests in exposed environments suffered much higher mortality in all brood cells owing to parasites attacking open cells during nest construction. Additionally, mortality caused by the cleptoparasitic drosophilid, Cacoxenus indagator, one of the main parasites of the Red Mason bee, increased greatly from the rear to the entrance of nests. When nesting bees detect the cleptoparasitic fly, they do not provision the outermost space of nesting holes, thus constructing a vestibulum, to avoid misinvestment due to the high risk of parasitism. In nests exposed to normal weather factors, vestibular cells probably shelter the brood also from high fluctuating temperatures.","Avoidance of parasitism; Nest architecture; Osmia rufa; Vestibulum",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032977506

In the anther, these purine alkaloids reach altogether a concentration of 0.9% dry wt which is close to the caffeine content of the Arabica coffee bean. The pollen alkaloid concentration is in the same range. Much lower but still marked concentrations were found in the nectar A considerable breakdown of alkaloids during honey production is assumed.

Sequence comparison with other virus polyproteins revealed regions of similarity to characterized helicase, protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domains; structural genes were located at the 5' terminus with non-structural genes at the 3' end. Picornavirus-like agents of insects have two distinct genomic organizations; some resemble mammalian picornaviruses with structural genes at the 5' end and non-structural genes at the 3' end, and others resemble caliciviruses in which this order is reversed; SBV thus belongs to the former type.

During conditioning, free-ranging parasitoids were given a choice between two visual alternatives, only one of which offered a host larva. By using alternatives that differed in either color, shape or pattern, parasitoids could be conditioned to distinguish host sites on the basis of each of these visual cues. Tests during which no reward was offered were conducted following six rewards (ovipositions) at one of the two alternative stimuli. The test results reveal that M. croceipes learned to distinguish between shapes more readily than between colors or patterns. This high rate of shape learning in this parasitoid is in strong contrast to the learning capacity of honey bees, which have been shown to learn color better than pattern and pattern better than shapes. It is argued that the difference in learning capacities between M. croceipes and the honey bee may reflect the different selection pressures imposed on these two species by their natural ecological needs. The high rate of shape learning in M. croceipes may be adaptive in dealing with the homochromatic but multishaped environment in which parasitoids have to locate their herbivorous hosts.","Host finding; Hymenopteran parasitoid; Learning predisposition; Visual discrimination",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000748240

We recorded the dances on swarms in a forested area, where one swarm's search encompassed about 150 km2 and many different sites. We then analyzed swarms in a desert area with only nest sites that we provided and monitored, to study how the swarm winnows multiple finds to a single site over the course of a few days. Most bees did not visit any site, very few visited more than one. Apparently choices were made with little or no direct comparison, through the interaction of two mechanisms: positive feedback through recruitment leading to growth in the number of scouts visiting good nest sites, and attrition reducing activity and recruitment for non-chosen sites. Individual differences between bees substantially affected these dynamics. Scouts varied considerably in amount of dancing and persistence, but most that danced did so vigorously after their first few visits, and then dropped out, ceasing their dancing though continuing to visit the nest site. Dances were nearly twice as long as reported for nectar and pollen. Scouts followed dances of others, and occasionally visited alternative sites, but rarely switched their dancing. When unanimity is reached, the bees must recognize that a decision has been made, break up the swarm cluster, and fly to the nest site. Buzz-running (Schwirrlaufen) probably plays a role here, but we observed less buzz-running than previously reported, and this occurred even early in the process; it might function as a chain-reaction effect triggering the end of the house-hunting process. Our results suggest that the choice among nest sites relies less on direct comparison of nest sites, and more on inherent processes of positive feedback and attrition by dancers dropping out.","Apis mellifera; Communication; Decision-making; Honey bee; House-hunting; Swarm",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032701643

Thoracic temperatures of bees free to move within small boxes were measured repeatedly and analyzed according to the bees' activity level: standing motionless, walking slowly, walking fast, etc. Also, thermographic measurements were made on bees experimentally immobilized but unharmed. The artificially immobilized bees were thermoregulating to an unpredictable extent, with a thoracic temperature excess of 0°-9°C above ambient temperature, which leads to the conclusion that research on energy turnover has to be done in animals which are free to move if conclusions relevant to natural situations are intended. The thoracic surface temperatures of the bees that could move freely also varied within wide limits, in this case following a bimodal distribution. One peak was near ambient temperature and the second peak around 35°-42°C at 25°C and around 38°-43°C at 35°C ambient temperature. Furthermore, considering the bees' level of activity led to a clear reduction of variability of the data.

The most active bees regulated thoracic temperature at an increased level (up to 42.8°C) to be able to move fast and to be prepared for immediate takeoff. In order for bees to regulate thoracic temperatures at a constant level independent of ambient temperature, energetic investment was much higher at lower ambient temperature: moderately active bees showed a thoracic temperature excess of 9.3°C at an ambient temperature of 25°C, but only 3.5°C at 35°C. Fast walking bees showed an even increased temperature excess of 14.3° and 5.6°C, respectively. Since, for the same behavior, the difference in ambient temperature did not change the bees' speed of motion as estimated by eye, it can be concluded that the greater part of the thoracic temperature excess originates from thermoregulation via the thoracic flight muscles, and was only in small part the result of walking activity. © 1999 E.

It is shown that the spectral breadth and asymmetry of photoreceptors in the honeybee may limit colour constancy. In particular, it is demonstrated that the absorption of short-wavelength radiation by the cis-band of chromophore is responsible for a poorer correction for bee colours rich in ultraviolet reflectance.

Manual outcrossing yielded more than twice as many seeds/flower as manual selfing. When all visitors were excluded most plants produced some seeds through autonomous self-pollination (7/flower), but seed set increased more than two-fold when flowers were manually selfed.

Hummingbirds visited an observation patch at least hourly.

Transmission from infected field plants to trap plants only occurred during bloom, indicating that flowers were the avenue for infection and flower- visiting insects including pollinators were involved. Trap plants readily became infected during bloom when a honeybee hive was included in cages with diseased field plants and trap plants. There was limited transmission in cages without a hive and no transmission when healthy field bushes were caged with trap plants either with or without honeybees. Infective pollen survived within the hive for 1 but not 2 weeks. Western flower thrips did not transmit BlShV when they were allowed to feed on caged flowering trap plants in the presence of a source of infected pollen. Results of pollen washes, cell disruption, and electron microscopy show that particles of BlShV were on, in, and between the cells of the pollen tetrad. Pollen from infected plants germinated as readily as pollen from healthy plants. BlShV was seedborne, but at a low level. All 42 cultivars tested were susceptible to BlShV when inoculated by grafting. The primary mechanism of transmission appears to be the transfer of BlShV-contaminated pollen by honeybees from flowers on infected plants to flowers on healthy plants.","Apis mellifera; Cultivar reaction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032950839

Whereas ASP2 secreted using the α-factor preprosequence with the spacer peptide showed N-terminal heterogeneity, the recombinant protein using the two other secretion peptides was correctly processed. Mass spectrometry showed that the protein secreted using the natural peptide sequence had a mass of 13,695.1 Da, in perfect agreement with the measured molecular mass of the native protein. These data showed a native-like processing and the three disulfide bridges formation confirmed by sulfhydryl titration analysis.

These territories expand and contract in response to frequency of disturbance. Organisms that employ aggression in their defence of territory normally employ a dramatic signalling behaviour designed to repulse intruders. If successful, fighting is avoided. Perhaps the most dramatic signalling behaviour employed by highly defensive AHB to maintain their territory is 'head butting'.

No differences in queen mating frequency were observed between Langeoog and Norderney. However, the level of polyandry on Baltrum was significantly lower than on the neighbouring islands, indicating that mating conditions were much more difficult. The standard genetic distance and differences in allele frequencies between the populations were determined to estimate putative origins of the drones. In this study, 43.7% of the identified drone fathers did not descend from any of the queens on the adjacent islands. They were most likely from mainland colonies at least 5.4 km (3 km across open water) away, showing that the combination of distances over open water and over dry land is important in explaining the mating behaviour of honeybee queens.","Apis mellifera; DNA microsatellite; Island; Mating control; Polyandry",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032706910

The most novel feature of this room is the use of prismatic reflectors to create even illumination within the room which measures 4.7×4.7 × 2.7 m high. The angular radiance of distribution of light in the room was measured using a spectrophotometer and this demonstrated that the 8 luminaire units used were sufficient for even illumination, thus considerably reducing the number of such units normally required for rooms of this size. Both UV and ‘white’ fluorescent tubes were incorporated, thus providing light which is suitable for both bees and the human observers within the room. Air conditioning units were placed in two corners of the room to maintain a temperature of 25° ± 1°C and relative humidity of 60% ± 5%, and a Ven- taxia extraction fan was used to ensure good circulation of fresh air within the room. To assess the suitability of the flight room for behavioural studies, a number of experiments were conducted. These included detailed observations on the foraging pattern of a bumble bee colony over a 6-day period as well as the use of computer software to compare, in detail, the foraging behaviour of individual honey bees and individual bumble bees. Since the room was commissioned, a number of colonies have been kept in the room and honey bees have successfully reared brood and survived many months. Although the room cannot totally simulate outdoor conditions, studying bees under such controlled conditions allows very detailed studies to be undertaken and we describe several further studies which we will undertake in the future. © 1999 International Bee Research Association.","Bumble bees; Controlled environments; Flight rooms; Foraging behaviour; Honey bees; Spectral intensities",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0039110409

In high-density plots, at one site, 30% fewer fruit set in Impatiens capensis.

In this paper, we update and extend this model by incorporating more recent data, in particular on mite invasion from bees into brood cells. By predicting invasion into and emergence from brood cells, the model proves to be useful to evaluate the effects of changes in model parameters on the mite population when the distribution of mites over bees and brood are important. The model predicts that a longer brood rearing period dramatically increases the mite population size and that a relatively larger number of drone brood cells leads to an increased population growth. As mite control treatments often only affect mites either in brood cells or on adult bees, the model can be used to evaluate their effectiveness and timing. The model indicates that changes in parameters that affect the reproductive success of the mites in brood cells have a large impact on the mite population.","Apis mellifera; Model; Population dynamics; Varroa jacobsoni",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032975028

Oral acute toxicity tests for adult bees of all antibiotics were determined by calculations of LD50 values at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, using dimethoate as reference compound. All the antibiotics tested showed no toxicity for adult bees, with LD50 values greater than 100 μg per bee. The times of degradation in honey were analysed for tylosin and erythromycin through HPLC and bioassays, respectively. Erythromycin, as ethyl succinate, was not effective for the control of AFB at any of the tested doses and its degradation time in honey was about 35–40 days. On the other hand, tylosin, as tartrate, was highly effective for the control of AFB, and also suppressed disease signs for one year after treatment. Its degradation time in honey was about 60 days.

The capitula are primarily visited by bees, beetles, thrips and flies. It is self-incompatible and requires pollination for seed set. The array of visitors was compared with those to other Grindelia species.

At the beginning of the waggle run, followers are rather evenly spaced around the dancer. During the waggle run, the followers tend to accumulate at the rear end of the dancer. At the end of the waggle run, all followers are found in a ±60° arc behind the dancer. The body orientation angles of the followers depend on their position relative to the dancer. The follower bees have intense antennal contact with the dancer. At least one temporal parameter of the contact pattern may inform the followers about their position relative to the dancer, may guide the dance followers to the rear end of the dancer and may allow them to extract information about the location of the food source advertised by the dance.

These chemicals are fat-soluble and non-volatile, and thus they accumulate in ppm levels as residues in beeswax with years of treatment. Through the process of diffusion, these ingredients migrate from the wax comb into the stored honey. In German honey, the most frequently found varroacide is coumaphos (28%). Bromopropylate is detectable but with decreasing frequency (11%). Because of its high binding strength in beeswax, fluvalinate detection is relatively rare in honey (1%). All residues were found with low ppb levels. Other ingredients with similar chemical behaviour presently play an unimportant role as residues in honey, beeswax and propolis owing to the very low amount of ingredients used (acrinathrine, flumethrine) or instability (amitraz).","Apis mellifera; Bee products; Residues; Varroacides",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032975703

This potentially reduces the risk of deadly injury. The fluid and one of its components, ortho-aminoacetophenone, were previously found to have a pheromonal effect on workers. Recently, it has been suggested that the effects of this substance may be context- or concentration-specific. We performed semiquantitative gas-chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of the fluid (i) released by queens during their first fight, (ii) released during a subsequent fight, and (iii) obtained by dissecting the hindgut of queens and (iv) of workers. Following preliminary results by Page et al. 1988 (Experientia 44:270-271), we scored presence/absence of eight substances. Five substances (ortho-aminoacetophenone, decanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, octyl decanoate, and decyl decanoate) were characteristic of queens only. ortho-Aminoacetophenone was detected in all queens and in none of the workers, in agreement with previous findings that worker rectal contents do not have pheromonal effect. The fluid released by queens on their second fight also contained ortho-aminoacetophenone, but in smaller quantities. This study confirms the unique presence in queens of five compounds, demonstrates their rectal origin, and estimates the amount of ortho-aminoacetophenone released during fights, as required to design experiments addressing the function and adaptive significance of fluid release behaviour.","Apis; Conflict; Fighting behaviour; Gas chromatography; Honeybee; Hymenoptera; Insects; Ortho-aminoacetophenone; Pheromone",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0004424046

We indirectly estimated queen mating frequency in two meliponids, Melipona beecheli and Scaptotrigona postica, by examining genotypes of workers at microsatellite DNA loci. Microsatellites were highly variable, providing suitable markers with which to assign patrilinial origin of workers within colonies headed by single queens. Queen mating frequency varied between l and 3 (M. beecheli) and 1 and 6 (S. postica), representing the first clear documentation of polyandry in the Meliponinae. Effective paternity frequency, m(e), was lower, although above 2 for S. postica. Stingless bees may provide suitable subjects for the testing of recent inclusive fitness arguments describing intracolony kin conflict in social Hymenoptera. Within the social Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps), multiple mating was first suggested in the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) because natural crosses between queens and drones of differently coloured subspecies resulted in diversely hued offspring (Gregor Mendel: see Iltis 1924; Ruttner 1954). In addition to the study of their reproductive biology, the mating frequency of social insect queens became an important issue under the kin selection hypothesis for the evolution of eusociality (Hamilton 1964). By means of molecular genetic approaches, considerable intra- and interspecific variation in queen mating frequency has now been detected in many groups of social hymenopterans (Boomsma and Ratnieks 1996; Crozier and Pamilo 1996).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033000994

Utilization of the nest boxes by the wood duck was analyzed with respect to plant community type, orientation and juxtaposition to other wood duck nest boxes. Forty-three wood duck nest boxes were observed and inspected in 1993. Wood ducks nested in 24 of the nest boxes, and 361 eggs were found. Clutch size ranged from 3 to 38 with a mean clutch size of 15. Nests with a clutch size of greater than 15 eggs suggest that the nest may have been a dump nest, i.e., a nest where eggs were deposited by two or more females. Eleven of the 24 nest boxes utilized by wood ducks contained clutches of more than 15 eggs. Eleven other species of birds, mammals and insects were observed and recorded utilizing some of the wood duck nest boxes prior to, during and subsequent to the wood duck nesting season which began in March and extended into June. Species observed were: screech owl (Otus asio), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), sparrow hawk (Falco sparverius), starling (Sturnus vulgaris), unidentified passerine, yellow-shafted flicker (Colaptes auratus), opossum (Didelphis virginiana), field mouse (Peromyscus sp.), honey bee (Apis mellifera), wasp (Polistes sp.), and Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus).

We asked whether the conditioning procedure used to train the bees to a pattern determines the recognition strategy employed. Bees were trained with the same patterns presented vertically on the back walls of a Y maze. Conditioning was either absolute, that is, bees should learn to choose a rewarded pattern when there is no alternative, or differential, that is, bees should learn to choose a rewarded pattern that is paired with a different, nonrewarded one. Bees used different pattern recognition strategies depending on the conditioning procedure: absolute conditioning restricted recognition to the lower half whilst differential conditioning extended it to the whole pattern. Bees trained with absolute conditioning saw and learned the features of the upper part of the trained patterns, but assigned more weight to the lower part. Bees trained with differential conditioning learned not only the features of the reinforced stimulus in an excitatory way, but also those of the nonreinforced one in an inhibitory way. Thus, conditioning tasks that involve not only excitatory acquisition of the conditioned stimulus per se, but also discrimination of nonreinforced stimuli, result in an increase in the visual field assigned to the recognition task. Conditioning tasks that involve only excitatory acquisition of the rewarded stimulus result in a higher weighting of the lower pattern half and thus in a more reduced field assigned to the recognition task.

The kinetic properties of this A current and its modulation by extracellular K+ ions were investigated in vitro with the whole cell patch-clamp technique. The A current was isolated from other voltage-gated currents either pharmacologically or with suitable voltage- clamp protocols. Hodgkin- and Huxley-style mathematical equations were used for the description of this current and for the simulation of action potentials in a Kenyon cell model. Activation and inactivation of the A current are fast and voltage dependent with time constants of 0.4 ± 0.1 ms (means ± SE) at +45 mV and 3.0 ± 1.6 ms at +45 mV, respectively. The pronounced voltage dependence of the inactivation kinetics indicates that at least a part of this current of the honeybee Kenyon cells is a shaker-like current. Deactivation and recovery from inactivation also show voltage dependency. The time constant of deactivation has a value of 0.4 ± 0.1 ms at -75 mV. Recovery from inactivation needs a double-exponential function to be fitted adequately; the resulting time constants are 18 ± 3.1 ms for the fast and 745 ± 107 ms for the slow process at -75 mV. Half-maximal activation of the A current occurs at -0.7 ± 2.9 mV, and half-maximal inactivation occurs at -54.7 ± 2.4 mV. An increase in the extracellular K+ concentration increases the conductance and accelerates the recovery from inactivation of the A current, affecting the slow but not the fast time constant. With respect to these modulations the current under investigation resembles some of the shaker-like currents. The data of the A current were incorporated into a reduced computational model of the voltage-gated currents of Kenyon cells. In addition, the model contained a delayed rectifier K+ current, a Na+ current, and a leakage current. The model is able to generate an action potential on current injection. The model predicts that the A current causes repolarization of the action potential but not a delay in the initiation of the action potential. It further predicts that the activation of the delayed rectifier K+ current is too slow to contribute markedly to repolarization during a single action potential. Because of its fast activation, the A current reduces the amplitude of the net depolarizing current and thus reduces the peak amplitude and the duration of the action potential.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032588656

Box 80.086, 3508 TB Utrecht, Netherlands","An individual-oriented model is constructed which simulates the collective foraging behaviour of a colony of honey-bees, Apis mellifera. Each bee follows the same set of behavioural rules. Each rule consists of a set of conditions followed by the behavioural act to be performed if the conditions are fulfilled. The set of conditions comprises the state of external information available to the bee (e.g. the dancing of other bees) and internal information variables (like memorised location of a food source and homing motivation). The rules are partly observational (i.e. they capture the observable regularities between the present external information and the individual bee's behaviour), and partly involve hypothesised internal-state variables (e.g. abandoning tendency and homing motivation), because no observable (physiological) aspect has as yet been detected in the bee which correlates with changes in the internal motivation. Our aim is to obtain a set of rules that is necessary and sufficient for the generation of the collective foraging behaviour observed in real bees. We simulated an experiment performed by Seeley et al. in which a colony of honey-bees chooses between two nectar sources of different profitabilities which are switched at intervals. A good fit between observed and simulated collective forager patterns was obtained when the model included rules in which the bees (1) relied on the information acquired from previous flights to a source (e.g. profitability and time of day when the source was found), (2) used positional information obtained by attending recruitment dances and (3) did not abandon a (temporarily) deteriorated source too fast or too slowly. The significance of the following issues is discussed: the role of internal and external information, source profitability, the spatial precision of the dance communication, the ability to search for a source after the source position has been transmitted, the tendency to abandon a deteriorated source, and the concepts of scout, recruit, (un)employed forager, and foraging history.","Collective behavior; Collective foraging; Communication; Honey-bee; Individual-oriented model",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031648252

It is unclear how the complex organization of the AL is achieved ontogenetically. In this study, we measured the functional activity patterns elicited by stimulation with odours in the right and the left AL of the same honeybee (Apis mellifera) using optical imaging of the calcium-sensitive dye calcium green. We show here that these patterns are bilaterally symmetrical (n = 25 bees). This symmetry holds true for all odours tested, irrespective of their role as pheromones or as environmental odours, or whether they were pure substances or complex blends (n = 13 odours). Therefore, we exclude that activity dependent mechanisms local to one AL determine the functional glomerular activity. This identity is genetically predetermined. Alternatively, if activity dependent processes are involved, bilateral connections would have to shape symmetry, or, temporal constraints could lead to identical patterns on both sides due to their common history of odour exposure.","Development; Insect; Olfactory glomeruli; Optical recording; Statistical analysis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032458596

The decision to collect pollen by honey bee foragers depends on the number of larvae (brood), amount of stored pollen in the colony, as well as forager genotype and available resources in the environment. Here we describe how brood pheromone (whole hexane extracts of larvae) influenced honey bee pollen foraging and test the predictions of two foraging-regulation hypotheses: the indirect or brood-food mechanism and the direct mechanism of pollen-foraging regulation. Hexane extracts of larvae containing brood pheromone stimulated pollen foraging. Colonies were provided with extracts of 1000 larvae (brood pheromone), 1000 larvae (brood), or no brood or pheromone. Colonies with brood pheromone and brood had similar numbers of pollen foragers, while those colonies without brood or pheromone had significantly fewer pollen foragers. The number of pollen foragers increased more than 2.5-fold when colonies were provided with extracts of 2000 larvae as a supplement to the 1000 larvae they already had. Within I h of presenting colonies with brood pheromone, pollen foragers responded to the stimulus. The results from this study demonstrate some important aspects of pollen foraging in honey bee colonies: (i) pollen foragers appear to be directly affected by brood pheromone, (2) pollen foraging can be stimulated with brood pheromone in colonies provided with pollen but no larvae, and (3) pollen forager numbers increase with brood pheromone as a supplement to brood without increasing the number of larvae in the colony. These results support the direct-stimulus hypothesis for pollen foraging and do not support the indirect-inhibitor, brood-food hypothesis for pollen-foraging regulation.","Behavior; Brood pheromone; Honey bee; Pollen foraging",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032439990

This attention produced the need for an identification tool that could be employed in research, survey, and detection and regulation. In part due to a long history of study and in part due to its intrinsic value, the discriminant analysis of morphometric data has become the tool of choice for identifying Africanized honey bees. Cost of analysis led to the development of simple methods to screen large numbers of samples without sacrificing the overall quality of identifications. With these screening procedures, all colonies that are determined to be European at a P ≥ 0.99 are considered European. All colonies that are not determined to be European are considered unidentified. Samples which remain unidentified after the initial screening are identified by a more complex morphometric procedure called USDA-ID. USDA-ID was developed primarily to provide several laboratories that were established to morphologically identify honey bees for regulatory purposes more accurate identification tools based on new discriminant analysis procedures.

Colony background information and winter loss data were obtained from beekeepers who had taken tracheal mite infested samples. A total of 2116 samples from honey bee colonies of 402 beekeepers were investigated. Infestations were found in 8 % of the beekeeping operations and in 10 % of the samples inspected. In the last years of the survey more than 20 % of apiaries were infested. This increase may be partly explained by tracheal mite infestations found in commercial queen-rearing apiaries. A field experiment with colonies infested at different levels showed that colonies in which 20 % or more of bees are infested with tracheal mites have an increased risk of dying during the winter under Finnish conditions. This infestation level was found among colonies in 92 % of the infested apiaries. Comparison of the tracheal mite prevalence in apiaries with their winter losses indicated that infestations were associated with colony mortality. The results of this survey point to the high pest potential of the tracheal mite in Finland, in contrast to findings on tracheal mites from elsewhere in Europe.

The outcome of the comparisons is discussed in the light of anatomical and optical regional specializations found in the bee's peripheral visual pathway, as well as in the light of the foraging bee's natural habits. It is concluded that the functional differences found among different eye regions are based on neural mechanisms subserving the bee's natural needs, rather than on peripheral specializations.","Apis mellifera; Behaviour; Colour discrimination; Eye-region-specific learning; Eye-regional specialization; Honeybee; Motion detection; Navigation; Pattern recognition",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032441121

In order to test the possibility of using proteinase inhibitors to confer insect pests resistance to this crop, transgenic oilseed rape lines constitutively expressing the serine proteinase inhibitor CII or the cysteine proteinase inhibitor OC-I have been obtained. The effects of ingestion of oilseed rape expressing OC-I have been determined on several Coleopteran pest larvae. Although no deleterious effect were observed on the insects tested, various reactions were observed at the gut proteinases level. Results are discussed together with prospects to improve pest resistance in rapeseed. In addition, since oilseed rape flowers provide abundant nectar and pollen and are therefore highly attractive to forager insects, possible deleterious effects on honeybees were assessed. Diet incorporation bioassays showed that deleterious effects were observed only at PI concentrations 100 fold higher than those expected in transgenic plants.","Apis mellifera; Baris coerulescens; Ceutorynchus assimilis; Psylliodes chrysocephala",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0003161075

Comparison of the volume of the MBs of 1-day-old and 7-day-old bees showed that a significant increase in volume in the MB neuropil occurred during the first week of life in bees reared under these highly deprived conditions. All regions of the MB neuropil experienced a significant increase in volume with the exception of the basal ring. Measurement of titers of juvenile hormone (JH) in a subset of bees indicated that, as in previous studies, these rearing conditions induced in some bees the endocrine state of high JH associated with foraging, but there was no correlation between JH titer and volume of MB neuropil. Treatment of another subset of dark-reared bees with the JH analog, methoprene, also had no effect of the growth of the MB neuropil. These results demonstrate that there is a phase of MB neuropil growth early in the adult life of bees that occurs independent of light or any form of social interaction. Together with previous findings showing that an increase in MB neuropil volume begins around the time that orientation flights occur and then continues throughout the phase of life devoted to foraging, these results suggest that growth of the MB neuropil in adult bees may have both experience-expectant and experience-dependent components.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032466807

Thelytokous workers are believed to be unique to Apis mellifera capensis, so that the problem is to find morphological markers distinguishing this race from its A. m. scutellata neighbours. However, no evidence of the expected hybrid zone demarcating races could be found. Factor analysis revealed only one spherical cluster of samples. Trend surfaces of the local mean morphometric factor scores showed a cline that paralleled latitude, with distortions relating to montane and continental effects. Discriminant function analysis implicated certain mountain ranges in amplifying the effects of latitude. Trend surfaces of local intercolony factor variance showed morphometric homogeneity across most of the country. We conclude that there is only a single population of honey bees in South Africa, and that it shows climate-correlated clinal variation. If the transportation of bees for commercial apiculture is to be successfully regulated to solve the 'capensis calamity', further research should focus on the geographical distribution of thelytokous workers rather than on the capensis phenotype.

This species was found to be established in high numbers in a variety of vegetation types from coastal heath, through sclerophyll forest, and subalpine shrubberies up to an altitude of 1100 m. Hence, it has the potential to spread through much of Tasmania and temperate, mesic regions of mainland Australia. It is highly polylectic, foraging on at least 66 native plant species from 21 families. While the most heavily visited species produced abundant nectar, the lack of predation on this species also allowed it to forage economically on small flowers in clusters. This foraging profile overlapped with those of all anthophilous insect families, all bee subgenera, and all species of nectarivorous birds which were encountered. Therefore, B. terrestris has the potential to compete with most native anthophiles and commercial honeybees. As it forages from some plant taxa which are not visited by the European honeybee, Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758, this species is impacting on plant-pollinator relationships which have previously been free from the effects of exotic bees.","Competition; Foraging profile; Introduced species; Pollinators",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-17944374263

The SSM were prepared by fusion of unilamellar phospholipid-vesicles on hydrophobic octanethiol monolayers previously chemisorbed on the gold electrode of a polished 5 MHz AT-cut quartz crystal. The bilayer formation was monitored by impedance spectroscopy revealing a mean specific capacitance of (1.0±0.1) μF/cm2 for the bilayer. The adsorption of melittin on these SSM up to a concentration of 20 μM in solution was followed by QCM-measurements. The adsorption isotherm exhibits three distinct regions. Up to a melittin concentration of 8-10 μM a submonomolecular coverage of the POPC-monolayer with melittin without any damage of the membrane structure was observed. Increasing the melittin concentration up to 20 μM leads evidently to a multilayer adsorption which is discussed either in terms of monomer or tetramer stacking to the surface. In this concentration-range of 8-20 μM the shift in the resonant frequency of the quartz crystal increases almost linear with the concentration of the peptide in solution. Higher concentrations than 20 μM result in a partial detachment of the POPC-monolayer confirmed by an increase of the specific capacitance and a dramatic increase of the resonant frequency.

All 169 eggs taken from worker cells were heterozygous at at least one microsatellite locus showing that the egg was fertilized. All 129 eggs taken from drone cells gave a single band at the B124 locus, strongly suggesting haptoidy.

However, the exact nature of these effects, particularly with regard to their expression in behavior, remains to be examined in detail. Here we use feature-negative and transwitching conditioning paradigms to show that honeybees can use configural cues in odor processing.

The stimulation of activity invoked by the second hypothesis might include increasing nest-site scouting and dance following early in the house-hunting process or rousing quiescent bees to prepare them for lift-off late in the process, or both. In studies of neotropical African bee swarms in Costa Rica and European bees in California we tested these hypotheses by looking for associations between production of vibration signals by nest-site recruiters and site attractiveness (indicated by which site was ultimately chosen and by distance from the swarm since swarms may have a distance preference). Overall, bees dancing for the chosen sites performed vibration signals to the same extent as those dancing for the other sites. There were no distance differences between sites whose scouts did and did not vibrate other bees. These results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that the vibration signal enhances recruitment to especially high quality sites and they support the hypothesis that it plays a general excitatory role in the context of house hunting by swarming bees.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031775343

The amplified fragment was shown to have a length of 350 bp in A. m. caucasica and 600 bp in A. m. mellifera.

The effects, if any, of honeybee-foraging on native plants and their native-bee pollinators is poorly understood as most studies to date have concentrated on bird-pollinated systems. Furthermore, such studies have been undertaken in temperate Australia where fetal and managed hives have been present for more than 150 years. In tropical Australia the impact of honeybees on the native biota is not known - yet the information is needed to assist with planning for the management of the large areas now under control of conservation authorities. We undertook a comparative study of honeybee and native bee pollination of the pioneer species Melastoma affine in tropical north Queensland, Australia, at a site where honeybees were recently introduced as managed hives. Melastoma affine is utilised by many animals in this ecosystem and its pollination mechanism is representative of several other pioneer species of the rainforest margin. Melastoma affine obligately relies on bee pollination to effect seed-set. Native bees were the most abundant floral visitors to M. affine although significantly more honeybees than native bees were sometimes present at flowers at the end of the morning. Honeybees were poor pollinators of M. affine compared with native bees. Honeybees deposited significantly less pollen on stigmas than native bees and honeybees actively removed pollen from stigmas. Consequently, fruit-set was less likely and seed-set was significantly lower in flowers to which honeybees were the last visitor, compared with cases where native bees were the last visitor - and the last visitor to M. affine flowers was most often A. mellifera. In 91% of interactions between honeybees and native bees, native bees were disturbed from foraging at flowers by honeybees. Honeybees reduced fitness in M. affine in this study and we thus conclude that honeybees are an undesirable introduction in montane tropical-rainforest systems in Australia and based on our findings we strongly recommend that honeybees not be agisted in or adjacent to conservation areas in the wet tropics of Australia.","Honeybees; Management; Native bees; Pollination; Wet tropics of Australia",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031717825

Like the GAGA factor and other members of this family, Psq is an important developmental regulator in Drosophila, having pleiotropic functions during oogenesis, embryonic pattern formation, and adult development. The GAGA factor controls the transcriptional activation of homeotic genes and other genes by binding to control elements containing the GAGAG consensus motif. Binding is associated with formation of an open chromatin structure that makes the control regions accessible to transcriptional activators. We show here that Psq contains a novel DNA-binding domain, which binds, like the GAGA factor zinc finger DNA- binding domain, to target sites containing the GAGAG consensus motif. Binding is suppressed, as in the GAGA factor and other proteins of the family, by the associated proteins-protein interaction motif. The DNA-binding domain, which we call the Psq domain, is identical with a previously identified region consisting of four tandem repeats of a conserved 50-amino acid sequence, the Psq motif. The Psq domain seems to be structurally related to known DNA- binding domains, both in its repetitive character and in the putative three- α-helix structure of the Psq motif, but it lacks the conserved sequence signatures of the classical eukaryotic DNA-binding motifs. Psq may thus represent the prototype of a new family of DNA-binding proteins.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032561176

Using 20 highly polymorphic microsatellite loci, we studied a sample of 142 drones captured in a congregation close to Oberursel (Germany). A parentage test based on lod score showed that this sample contained one group of four brothers, six groups of three brothers, 20 groups of two brothers and 80 singletons. These values are very close to a Poisson distribution. Therefore, colonies were apparently equally represented in the drone congregation, and calculations showed that the congregation comprised males that originated from about 240 different colonies. This figure is surprisingly high. Considering the density of colonies around the congregation area and the average flight range of males, it suggests that most colonies within the recruitment perimeter delegated drones to the congregation with an equal probability, resulting in an almost perfect panmixis. Consequently, the relatedness between a queen and her mates, and hence the inbreeding coefficient of the progeny, should be minimized. The relatedness among the drones mated to the same queen is also very low maximizing the genetic diversity among the different patrilines of a colony.","Honeybee; Lod scores; Mating behaviour; Microsatellites; Panmixis; Relatedness",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032558843

Examination of proliferating EBV B-cells indicated that the cells lost viability within a few minutes exposure to pilosulin 1.

In contrast to earlier suggestions, experimental tests showed that the age of a bee does not seem to influence its probability of becoming a scout or a recruit. Furthermore, scout bees do not search opportunistically for either pollen or nectar but, rather, individuals have preferences that are genetically based.

Although it is well known that foragers exhibit robust circadian patterns of activity in both field and laboratory settings, we report that many in-hive tasks are not allocated according to a daily rhythm but rather are performed 24 h per day. Around-the-clock activity at the colony level is accomplished through the performance of some tasks by individual workers randomly with respect to time of day. Bees are initially arrhythmic with respect to task performance but develop diel rhythmicity, by increasing the occurrence of inactivity at night, prior to becoming foragers. There are genotypic differences for age at onset of rhythmicity and our results suggest that these differences are correlated with genotypic variation in rate of behavioral development: genotypes of bees that progressed through the age polyethism schedule faster also acquired behavioral rhythmicity at an earlier age. The ontogeny of circadian rhythmicity in honey bee workers ensures that essential in-hive behaviors are performed around the clock but also allows the circadian clock to be engaged before the onset of foraging.","Apis mellifera; Circadian rhythms; Division of labor; Honey bees; Social insects; Temporal polyethism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031874751

The type of inflorescence based on the opening order of the flowers in them was important from the point of view of bee visitation. The average number of honeybee visits was greater at inflorescences with centripetal opening order (28 in average) compared to ones with centrifugal flowering (21 in average). This is explained by the higher number of flowers in centripetal type inflorescence (9.3 in average compared to 6.6) and by their blooming period that is 28 per cent longer than the same of centrifugal inflorescence. Consequently there was as much as some 40 per cent difference in the fruit set of the two types of inflorescences in average. Divergent type can be characterized by a transitional position between the mentioned two groups buts its features are much more resembling to the centrifugal than to the centripetal type. Accordingly, flowering order in pear inflorescences has got a definite effect of bee visitation and yield of pear cultivars.

To study how this inhibitor is transmitted, bees were reared for 7 days in double-screen cages, single-screen cages, or unrestricted in a typical colony (control bees). Double-screen cages prevented physical contact with colony members while single-screen cages allowed only antennation and food exchange. Bees reared in double-screen cages showed accelerated endocrine and behavioral development; they had significantly higher rates of juvenile hormone biosynthesis and juvenile hormone titers than did control bees and also were more likely to become precocious foragers. Relative to the other two groups, bees reared in single-screen cages showed intermediate juvenile hormone biosynthesis rates and titers, and intermediate rates of behavioral development. These results indicate that physical contact is required for total inhibition. We also began to test the hypothesis that worker mandibular glands are the sources of an inhibitory signal. Old bees with mandibular glands removed were significantly less inhibitory towards young bees than were sham-operated and unoperated bees.

The 15 electromorphs sequenced turned out to hide 31 alleles (i.e., variants identical in sequence). Variation in the amount of size homoplasy was detected among electromorphs and loci. From one to seven alleles were detected per electromorph, and one locus did not show any size homoplasy in both bee species. The amount of size homoplasy was related to the sequencing effort, since the number of alleles was correlated with the number of copies of electromorphs sequenced, but also with the molecular structure of the core sequence at each locus. Size homoplasy within populations was detected only three times, meaning that size homoplasy was detected mostly among populations. We analyzed population structure, estimating F(st) and a genetic distance, based on either electromorphs or alleles.

If sucrose solution was delivered continuously, it accumulated at the food source in an amount proportional to the pause length and the flow rate of nectar. When the flow rate of sucrose solution was further decreased but kept constant throughout the day, a threshold level was attained in which oscillations in the length of the pauses were observed. The relationship between the amount of accumulated nectar and subsequent pause length at this threshold level can be depicted by means of a power function.

Chemical signals are dispersed through two physical forces; diffusion and fluid flow. The interaction between antennal morphology and fluid flow generates a region of changing flow velocity called the boundary layer. The boundary layer determines signal dispersion dynamics and therefore influences the signal structure and information that arrives at the receptor cells. To investigate how the boundary layer changes the formation in the signals arriving at receptor cells, we measured chemical dynamics within the boundary layer around the been antennae using microelectrodes. We used two types of chemical signals: pulsed and continuous. The results showed that the boundary layer increased the decay time of the chemical signal for the pulsatile stimuli and increased the peak height for the continuous data. Spectral analysis of continuous signals showed that the temporal aspects of the chemical signal are changed by the boundary layer. Particularly the temporal dynamics of the signal are dampened at the slowest flow speed and amplified at the intermediate and fast flow speeds. By altering the structure of the chemical signal, the morphology will function as a sensory filter.","A. mellifera; Antenna; Chemoreception; Fluid flow; Olfaction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032126123

Typically, learning about one element (X) of a compound (AX) is decreased (blocked) if the other component (A) has previously been rewarded alone. Our results show that visual pretraining did not produce blocking in honeybees: instead, forward pairings of A with a reward increased subsequent learning about X relative to a backward pairing control. This finding violates the independence assumption, which holds that elements of inter-modal compound stimuli change associative strength independently of each other. Furthermore, iris at odds with common theories of conditioning that predict blocking and assume that the elements of a compound stimulus rely on one common internal reinforcing signal. Taking the functional anatomy of the honeybee brain into account, we suggest that vision and olfaction may not rely on the same internal reinforcing signal; compound interactions might thus reflect the wiring of the honeybee nervous system and the biological significance of different sensory modalities during natural behaviour.","Apis mellifera; Blocking; Classical conditioning; Honeybee; Learning; Memory; Olfaction; Reinforcement processing; Reward processing; Vision",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032127706

The alternative arm displayed the unrewarded grey background alone. Training and testing were performed with the rewarding disc subtending different visual angles. The training disc was either achromatic and provided green contrast, or chromatic and provided the same amount of green contrast as the achromatic one. The bee-achromatic disc could be learned and detected by the bees whenever it subtended 5°or 10°, but not if it subtended 30°. The chromatic disc was learned well and detected at all three visual angles. However, at 5°the maximum level of correct choices was ca. 75% with the achromatic disc whilst it was ca. 90% with the chromatic one. Thus, the presence of chromatic contrast enhances considerably the level of correct choices for the same amount of green contrast. The lower threshold of achromatic target detection lies between 3.7°and 5°; the upper threshold between 15°and 10°. At the upper threshold, detection switches from chromatic-based to achromatic-based. Thus, in the context of target detection, the achromatic green contrast channel specialises in the detection of objects of reduced angular size, whilst the chromatic channels are specialised for objects of large angular size.

Laboratory, Sand Hutton, York, YO4 1LZ, United Kingdom","The ectoparasitic mite Varroa jacobsoni Oud. presently poses one of the most serious problems faced by keepers of honeybees Apis mellifera L. To help understand why the mite has become such a serious problem a population dynamics model using recently published data has been constructed. The simulation model has been built by linking together various aspects of the mites' biology using computer software (ModelMaker®) in such a way that an initial population of mites can change daily over any period. The model predicts a yearly 12-fold increase in mite numbers or an intrinsic rate of daily increase of 0.021 during the presence of bee brood. This corresponds well with field data. Values derived from the model for behaviours such as drone preference (5.5-12 times) and phoretic period (4-11 days) are similar to those actually observed. Therefore, the model can be used to predict the number of mites within any colony and their subsequent development over any period. Since the daily development of both the live population and numbers of dead mites are predicted by the model it can be used as a mite population monitoring tool. The model predicts that the ratio of live to dead mites will change dramatically between periods when bee brood is present or absent. However, since the ratios were shown to be stable within the periods, the mite population can be estimated throughout the year by multiplying the daily mite drop by ≃ 250-500 or 20-40 when brood is absent or present, respectively. This will allow beekeepers to optimise their mite control strategy. The model also reveals the complex pattern in infestation levels that occurred throughout the year which was caused by the interactions between the bee and mite breeding cycles and will allow the role of bee viruses in the collapse of the colony to be studied in much greater detail.","Apis; Model; Population; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032557967

The polypeptides exhibit crossed immunoreactivity and share similar biochemical properties such as those involved in purification. They have been identified as isoforms of troponin- T (TnT) by sequence analysis of a cDNA clone isolated from an embryonic library. The two sets of TnT polypeptides correspond to the fibrillar and non-fibrillar muscle isoforms, respectively. The non-fibrillar muscle isoforms separate into two bands which are differentially expressed during development. Analysis of TnT isoforms in bee thoraces indicates that the expression of the fibrillar muscle isoform correlates with the acquisition of functional flight capability. In vivo labelling experiments reveal that the two TnT sets are readily phosphorylated. The Drosophila TnTs show calcium- binding properties by three different types of assays. Our results suggest that this property could be specific to insect TnTs and may be related to the long, extremely acidic polyglutamic carboxy-terminus present in these polypeptides, which does not occur in non-arthropod TnTs.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031778839

We examined honey bee workers that performed vibration signals on queens and developing queen cells in three observation hives, each containing a population of marked bees of known age. In all three colonies, workers of all ages greater than 2d old could perform vibration signals on queens and queen cells. However, most signals were performed by a small proportion of the bees of greater than 10 d of age. Relatively few workers less than 10 d old vibrated queens and queen cells, even though this age-group is typically associated with queen care. Thus, the regulation of queen behavior by the vibration signal may occur primarily through a relatively small subset of older workers that, under most circumstances, have only limited involvement with queens. It is unclear what triggers the vibrating of queens. Workers producing vibration signals did not differ from same-age non-vibrating controls in rate of locomotion in the hive or in task performance, and they rarely engaged in foraging, even though the majority of observed bees were of foraging age; vibrators also did not spend more time with queens and queen cells compared with controls.

It may function in a 'modulatory' manner, because it causes a nonspecific increase in activity that enhances a variety of behaviors depending upon the age and caste of the recipient. We examined honey bee workers that performed vibration signals on other workers in three observation hives, each containing a population of marked bees of known age. In all three colonies, the mean age of the first performance of the vibration signal was significantly different from the mean age at which workers first performed waggle dances, carried pollen loads, or attended the queen. However, workers of all ages, except those less than 3 d old, could perform vibration signals. In older workers of foraging age, signal performance was most closely associated with recent foraging success. Younger workers that vibrated did not appear to be early-maturing foragers and thus their signals were probably not influenced by food collection. Rather, for these preforaging-age workers, signal performance was associated more with periods of orientation flight, during which younger bees learn the location of the nest and surrounding landmarks. Thus, the vibration signal may be triggered by different stimuli in different worker age classes. Because it elicits a general increase in activity in all recipients, the signal may help adjust many different colony behaviors simultaneously to changes in foraging success and colony development.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031844621

Changes in PKC activity induced by olfactory conditioning were measured in the antennal lobes, a brain structure involved in associative learning. Multiple conditioning trials inducing a memory different from that induced by a single conditioning trial specifically cause an increase in PKC activity. This increase begins 1 hr after conditioning, lasts up to 3 d, and is attributable to an increased level of constitutive PKC. The increased level of constitutive PKC consists of an early proteolysis-dependent phase and a late phase that requires RNA and protein synthesis. Inhibition of the pathways resulting in constitutive PKC selectively impairs distinct phases of multiple-trial induced memory. The inhibition of the proteolytic mechanism has an instant effect on an early phase of multiple-trial induced memory but does not affect acquisition and the late phase of memory. Blocking of the transient PKC activation during conditioning does not affect the induction of memory formation. Thus, the constitutive PKC in the antennal lobe seems to contribute to the early phase of memory that is induced by multiple-trial conditioning.","Antennal lobe; Memory phases; Olfactory learning; Protein kinase C; Thiol proteases; Transcription; Translation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344813716

Flies had to learn to suppress the sugar-induced PER to avoid an aversive quinine reinforcement. In a yoked control group, the punishment was administered with no relation to the response displayed. Honeybees underwent a five-trial olfactory conditioning of the PER elicited by an antennal gustatory stimulation. In the control group, olfactory and gustatory stimulations were unpaired to prevent a learning process from developing. Immediately at the end of the learning session, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was individually measured on the whole animal for Drosophila and on the head for the honeybee in experimental and in control groups. In fruitflies and honeybees, the AChE rate did not differ between the experimental group and its respective control group. Moreover, no significant correlation could be found individually between the learning performance and the AChE rate in either Drosophila or in honeybees.

The predicted protein shows a high level of identity to known arginine kinases in invertebrates and to other proteins belonging to the conserved family of ATP: guanidino phospho-transferases. The pattern of expression of arginine kinase has been investigated for the first time in various tissues including the brain, antennae and compound eye. Our results show that three isoforms of arginine kinase, transcribed from a single gene, are expressed in a characteristic pattern in major tissues of the honey bee. Arginine kinase mRNA is relatively abundant in the central nervous system and in the antennae. However, the highest level of expression, that is at least two to three times higher than in the brain, is found in the compound eye of the bee. By contrast, the levels of mRNAs encoding another metabolically important enzyme, α-glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase (α-GPDH), are low in the eye. These findings suggest that arginine kinase is an important component of the energy releasing mechanism in the visual system that has high and fluctuating energy demands. Furthermore, our results support the role of phosphagen kinases in energy transport in polarised cells and are consistent with the role of arginine kinase as an energy shuttle that delivers ATP generated by mitochondria to high energy-requiring processes, such as massive membrane turnover and pigment regeneration in the retina.","α-GPDH; Energy shuttle; Phosphagen kinase; Polarised cells",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032510729

When the treatment is effected during the feeding phase of the fifth larval instar (LF5), the pupal development is blocked and pigmentation does not occur. Treatment of older larvae, at the spinning phase of the fifth larval instar (LS5), of prepupae (PP) or pupae at the beginning of the pupal period (Pw, white-eyed, unpigmented cuticle pupae) does not impair pigmentation, but, instead, this process is accelerated, intensified and abnormal. Hormonal treatment during these developmental phases (LS5, PP and Pw) induces earlier activity of phenoloxidase, an enzyme of the reaction chain leading to melanin synthesis. Treated pupae have significantly higher enzymatic levels and show a graded response in phenoloxidase activity after treatment with 0.1, 1 or 5 μg pyriproxyfen. Besides pigmentation, other developmental events were also altered in treated bees: pupal development was shortened, and the expression of esterase-6 activity, the onset of which coincides with the beginning of pigmentation, was shifted with the precocious initiation of this process in treated pupae. The significance of these results is discussed in relation to the mode of hormonal action on cuticular pigmentation in insects.","Apis mellifera; Cuticular melanization; Hymenoptera; Phenoloxidase; Pyriproxyfen",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031850709

BrdU and TUNEL labeling were used to study dynamics of cell proliferation and apoptosis- dependent DNA degradation in ovaries of naturally developing queens and workers, as well as in juvenile hormone-treated worker larvae. Cell proliferation in ovaries of last-instar queen larvae generally exceeded that in workers, except for the late feeding phase. This inversion in cell proliferation patterns coincided with the onset of apoptosis in worker ovaries, as evidenced by TUNEL labeling. Juvenile hormone application to early-fifth-instar worker larvae had two noticeable effects. First, it diminished the number of S-phase nuclei in ovaries of late feeding-phase workers, bringing them to queen-like levels. Second, it prevented the induction of apoptotic DNA degradation. Caste-specific regulation of cell division in connection with programmed cell death can thus be attributed to the previously described differences in juvenile hormone titer in queen and worker larvae, adding a new facet to this hormone's multiple functions.","BrdU; Honey bee; Insect ovary; Programmed cell death; TUNEL",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031821401

These receptors play a central role in modulating nerve cell activity and thus behaviour. Because the honey bee offers numerous advantages for behavioural studies we endeavoured to isolate as many members of this gene family as possible from the bee. We compared numerous approaches to gene isolation and found that PCR amplification from small subfractions of cDNA or genomic DNA libraries enabled us to isolate clones that are otherwise undetectable. In total we isolated seven biogenic amine receptor clones and identified five additional related sequences by low-stringency Southern hybridization. Two clones, AmBAR4 and AmBAR6, are 84% and 72% identical to the Drosophila 5-HT2 and D1b receptors, respectively, and probably represent orthologous genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that AmBAR5 clusters loosely with a variety of tyramine and octopamine receptors with which it shares <66% identity. The other four clones, AmBAR1, AmBAR2, AmBAR3 and AmBAR7, are weakly to moderately related (28-45% identical) to Drosophila dopaminergic or mammalian adrenergic receptors and probably represent receptors of these classes whose orthologues have not previously been isolated from any insect. The honey bee clones expand the size of the known insect biogenic amine receptor gene family to sixteen members. Therefore the size of the biogenic amine receptor gene family of insects approaches that of vertebrates. This is true despite the reduced behavioural and genetic complexity of the insects relative to vertebrate animals.","Apis mellifera; Dopamine; Gene; Octopamine; Serotonin",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032079248

Returning pollen and nectar foragers were collected at the entrance of a colony and were assayed in the laboratory. Pollen foragers had a significantly higher probability of responding to water and to lower concentrations of sucrose. Bees derived from artificially selected high- and low-pollen-hoarding strains were also tested using the proboscis extension assay. Returning foragers were captured and tested for PERs to 30% sucrose. Results demonstrated a genotypic effect on PERs of returning foragers. The PERs of departing high- and low-strain foragers were consistent with those of returning foragers. The PERs were related to nectar and water reward perception of foragers. High strain bees were more likely to return with loads of water and lower concentrations of sucrose than foragers from the low pollen strain. Low-strain bees were more likely to return empty. We identified a previously mapped genomic region that contains a variable quantitative trait locus that appears to influence sucrose response thresholds.

We performed a PCR-based screen to identify the genes encoding the Apis blue- and ultraviolet (UV)- sensitive opsins. We obtained cDNAs that encode proteins having a high degree of sequence and structural similarity to other invertebrate and vertebrate visual pigments. The Apis blue opsin cDNA encodes a protein of 377 amino acids that is most closely related to other invertebrate visual pigments that are thought to be blue-sensitive. The UV opsin cDNA encodes a protein of 371 amino acids that is most closely related to the UV-sensitive Drosophila Rh3 and Rh4 opsins. To test whether these novel Apis opsin genes encode functional visual pigments and to determine their spectral properties, we expressed them in the R1-6 photoreceptor cells of blind ninaE mutant Drosophila, which lack the major opsin of the fly compound eye. We found that the expression of either the Apis blue- or UV-sensitive opsin in transgenic files rescued the visual defect of ninaE mutants, indicating that both genes encode functional visual pigments. Spectral sensitivity measurements of these files demonstrated that the blue and UV visual pigments are maximally sensitive to light at 439 and 353 nm, respectively. These maxima are in excellent agreement with those determined previously by single-cell recordings from Apis photoreceptor cells and provide definitive evidence that the genes described here encode visual pigments having blue and UV sensitivity.","Apis mellifera; Blue-sensitive opsin; Drosophila melanogaster; Electro-retinogram; Honeybee; Protein expression; Spectral tuning; Ultraviolet- sensitive opsin; Visual pigment",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032053409

We collected worker progeny arising from eggs that were laid sequentially during three sampling periods. Paternity was determined by analysis of three polymorphic microsatellite loci, leading to the conclusion that the queen had mated with seven males. Direct analysis of the sperm from the spermatheca revealed no evidence that sperm from additional males was present inside the spermatheca. Frequencies of different subfamilies differed significantly and ranged from 3.8% to 27.3%. In the short term, the frequencies of subfamilies among the eggs laid did not change over time. The frequency of eggs of a particular subfamily was statistically independent of the previous egg's subfamily. Thus, there is no evidence for non-random finescale sperm usage, and we estimate the effect of sperm clumping to be less than 6%. We conclude that the sperm is mixed completely inside the queen's spermatheca. Our results suggest that taking brood samples from comb cells next to each other is a statistically correct way of independent sampling of subfamilies at a given time in honey bee colonies. Furthermore, any bias in subfamily frequencies in offspring queens due to sperm usage can be excluded. However, the analyses of progeny samples taken 12 months apart do not allow us to exclude moderate fluctuations of subfamily frequencies in the long-term.","Apis mellifera; Microsatellite; Polyandry; Sperm usage",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031971177

The effect of crude honeybee (Apis mellifera) venom on the skeletal, smooth as well as cardiac muscles were studied in this investigation. 2.

Blocking of nicotinic receptors with 3 μg/ml flaxedil before bee venom application sustained normal contraction of gastrocnemius muscle. 3. The electrical activity of duodenum rabbits was recorded before and after the application of 1 μg/ml venom solution. The venom has depressed the amplitude of the muscle contraction after 15 min pretreatment with atropine nearly abolished the depressor effect of the venom on smooth muscle. 4. In concentrations from 0.5 - 2 μg/ml, bee venom caused decrease of heart rate of isolated perfused toad heart. This bradycardia was accompanied by elongation in the P-R interval. A gradual and progressive increase in the R-wave amplitude reflected a positive inotropism of the venom. Application of 5 μg/ml verapamil, a calcium channels blocking agent, abolished the noticed effect of the venom. 5. Marked electrocardiographic changes were produced within minutes of the venom application on the isolated perfused hearts, like marked injury current (elevation or depression of the S-T segment), atrioventricular conduction disturbances and sinus arrhythmias.

Results of the present work lead to the suggestion that bee venom is mediated through the peripheral cholinergic neurotransmitter system. General neurotoxicity of an inhibitory nature involving the autonomic as well as neuromuscular system are established as a result of the venom, meanwhile a direct effect on the myocardium membrane stabilization has been suggested.","ECG; Honey bee venom; Muscles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031942305

The bees see the positive (rewarded) and the negative (unrewarded) targets from a fixed distance. The patterns were bars (subtending 22°x 5.4°at the point of choice) presented in one- quarter of each target. The bars were moved to a different quarter of the target every 5 min, to make the location of back useless as a cue. A coincident presentation is when the bar on the left target is on the same side of the target as the bar on the right target. The bees learn the orientation cue when the presentation is coincident but otherwise cannot lean it. This experiment show that bees do not center their attention on the individual bars, otherwise they would always discriminate the orientation. Centering the target as a whole precedes learning. Having learned with the bar on one side of the targets, bees do not recognize the same cue presented on the other side. A separate orientation cue can be learned on each side. A radial/tangential cue is preferred to a conflicting orientation cue.","Bee; Edge orientation; Pattern perception",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032032038

The absence of a queen during early adult life also has site-specific effects on the maturation of the antennal lobes of the brain.

The bees actively regulate the relative quantity of each type, a behavior likely to be important in setting a colony's sex ratio. Experimental analysis of the information pathways and control mechanisms responsible for this regulation found the following results. The amount of drone comb in a nest is governed by negative feedback from drone comb already constructed. This feedback depends on the workers having direct contact with the drone comb in their nest, but does not depend on the queen's contact with the comb. The comb itself, rather than the brood within it, is sufficient to provide the negative feedback, although the brood may also contribute to the effect. These findings show that drone comb regulation does not depend on the queen acting as a centralized information gatherer and behavioral controller. Instead, the evidence points to a decision-making process distributed across the population of worker bees, a control architecture typical of colony organization in honey bees and other large-colony insect societies.","Apis mellifera; Comb; Decentralized control; Drone; Honey bee",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031922999

However, examples are known whereby closely related species exhibit alterations in early embryogenesis yet appear very similar as adults. Such developmental changes are thought to occur in response to shifts in life history. In insects, the regulation of embryonic development has been intensively studied in model species like Drosophila melanogaster. Previous comparative studies suggest that the developmental processes documented in Drosophila well describe embryogenesis of advanced, holometabolous, insects generally. There have been few attempts, however, to take into account how life history has influenced early development of insects or to characterize early development of species with life histories fundamentally different from flies. Here we compared early development of two species from the same family of parasitic wasps that exhibit very different life histories. Bracon hebetor is an ectoparasite that lays large, yolky eggs on the integument of its host that develop much like the free-living honeybee and Drosophila. In contrast, Aphidius ervi is an endoparasite that lays small and apparently yolk-free eggs that develop in the hemocoel of the host. This wasp exhibits a radically different mode of early development at both the cellular and molecular level from B. hebetor. The developmental changes in A. ervi reflect functional adaptations for its derived life history and argue that departures from the fly paradigm may occur commonly among insects whose eggs develop under conditions different from typical terrestrial species.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032477807

The lowest average infestation level was 0.82 mites per 100 adult bees observed in the North Litoral region, and the highest average infestation levels were observed in the North Center, South and Metropolitan regions (5.12, 4.19 and 4.91 mites/100 adult bees respectively) About 90.1% of the colonies had infestation levels of less than 10 mites /100 adult bees and only 1.2% of the colonies presented an infestation level of more than 20 mites /100 adult bees.

These experts in pollination ecology confirmed that the last 5 years of losses of honeybee colonies in North America leave us with fewer managed pollinators than at any time in the last 50 years and that the management and protection of wild pollinators is an issue of paramount importance to our food supply system. Although there are conclusive data that indicate 1200 wild vertebrate pollinators may be at risk, data on the status of most invertebrate species that act as pollination agents is lacking. The recommendations from a working group of over 20 field scientists, presented here, have been endorsed by 14 conservation and sustainable agriculture organizations, research institutes, and professional societies, including the Society for Conservation Biology. Among the most critical priorities for future research and conservation of pollinator species are (1) increased attention to invertebrate systematics, monitoring, and reintroduction as part of critical habitat management and restoration plans; (2) multi-year assessments of the lethal and sublethal effects of pesticides, herbicides, and habitat fragmentation on wild pollinator populations in and near croplands; (3) inclusion of the monitoring of seed and fruit set and floral visitation rates in endangered plant management and recovery plans; (4) inclusion of habitat needs for critically-important pollinators in the critical habitat designations for endangered plans; (5) identification and protection of floral reserves near roost sites along the 'nectar corridors' of threatened migratory pollinators; and (6) investment in the restoration and management of a diversity of pollinators and their habitats adjacent to croplands in order to stabilize or improve crop yields. The work group encourages increased education and training to ensure that both the lay public and resource managers understand that pollination is one of the most important ecological services provided to agriculture through the responsible management and protection of wildland habitats and their populations of pollen-vectoring animals and nectar-producing plants.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031966886

Whereas melittin, a major component of honeybee venom, is unfolded in an aqueous environment, the addition of alcohols induces an α-helical structure. We used circular dichroism (CD) to compare the effects of various alcohols on melittin. Whereas the α-helical state was basically independent of alcohol species, the effectiveness of alcohols varied significantly. Among alkanols, the effectiveness was proportional to the bulkiness of hydrocarbon groups, indicating that the hydrocarbon group contributes positively to the alcohol effects. Comparison of alcohols with the same hydrocarbon group but a different number of hydroxyl groups showed that the hydroxyl groups contribute negatively to the alcohol effects. Comparison of several halogenols indicated that halogen increases the effectiveness in the order of F < Cl < Br. These results suggested that the effects of alcohol can be interpreted by the additive contributions of each of the constituent groups of the alcohol, which are proportional to the solvent-accessible surface area. However, for markedly effective alcohols such as 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol, the aggregation of alcohols was suggested to further enhance these effects. We have constructed equations for estimating the effectiveness of alcohols in inducing α-helical structure, which should also be useful for predicting the other effects of alcohols on proteins.","Alcohol; Hexafluoroisopropanol; Melittin; Protein folding; α-helix",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032536194

Moreover, the genetic profiles are rather homogeneous from southern Spain to Scandinavia. French populations are more or less introgressed (a few percent up to 57 %) by genes from the north Mediterranean lineage which provides most of the imported queens. The inferred percentage of introgressed nuclear genes is generally well correlated with the proportion of alien mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) haplotypes detected in the same populations.

When Australian-reared A. mellifera sister queens were transported to Germany and Papua New Guinea and established in varroa-infested colonies, the female V. jacobsoni in Germany readily reproduced on their brood whereas in Papua New Guinea they did not. These observations indicate that the cause of the reported inability of female V. jacobsoni to reproduce on A. mellifera in Papua New Guinea does not rest with the resident A mellifera population. DNA sequences of a 454 base-pair region of the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene obtained from reproducing V. jacobsoni collected from A. mellifera colonies in Germany differed by 6.8% from similar sequences obtained from non-reproducing V. jacobsoni from A. mellifera colonies in Papua New Guinea. The presence of a Xho I restriction endonuclease (RE) site in the German but not in the Papua New Guinea sequences, and a Sac I RE site in the Papua New Guinea but not in the German sequences, allowed for the rapid identification of individual mites of the German (GER) and Papua New Guinea (PNG) genotypes. Further studies confirmed that non-reproducing female V. jacobsoni that were the only V. jacobsoni present in A. mellifera colonies in Java, Indonesia, prior to 1993 were of the PNG genotype. However, reproducing female V. jacobsoni that suddenly appeared in A. mellifera colonies in Java in 1993 were of the GER genotype. Following 1993, reproducing mites of the GER genotype and non-reproducing mites of the PNG genotype were detected in a single A. mellifera colony in Java and in another single colony in another region of Indonesia. These results clearly demonstrate that differences in mite genotype can explain observed differences and changes in the virulence of V. jacobsoni toward A. mellifera. © 1998 International Bee Research Association.","Apis mellifera; CO1 gene sequence; Genetic variation; Germany; Mite reproduction; Mitochondrial DNA; MtDNA sequence; Papua New Guinea; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032327770

The stronger the impact of laying workers the further should the capensis mt type introgress into the scutellata population. The theoretical model is supported by empirical data from the hybrid zone between the two subspecies.

Iberian populations (Apis mellifera iberica) are characterised by a extended cline between haplotypes A and M, the former being almost fixed in south Spain and Portugal, and the latter almost pure in northeastern populations. This introgression is most likely attributable to humans and is probably ancient. French populations (A.m. mellifera) exhibit various levels of introgression by the C mtDNA lineage. Introgression is rather low in regions with a dominance of amateur bee-keeping while it reaches very high values in regions where professional bee-keepers regularly import foreign queens (mainly A. m. ligustica and A. m. caucasica).

Aspects of the flowering biology of wild cashew Anacardium occidentale, an andromonoecious, self-fertile tree, were studied in the north-east of Brazil, where this species is endemic. Comparison was made among two bee species, Apis mellifera and Centris tarsata, in their pollination of cashew flowers using a number of measures including single bee visits to marked flowers. 2. Cashew flowering is protandrous within a day. Male flowers greatly outnumber hermaphrodite flowers. Stigmas lose receptivity rapidly and pollen is quickly removed from anthers yet flowers remain intact for several days. 3. Only females of C. tarsata collected pollen from cashew flowers, and then only from male flowers. The similar foraging behaviour of the nectar collectors of the two bee species under investigation when visiting hermaphrodite cashew flowers suggests that they may both act as good pollinators. 4. We develop an index of efficiency of pollen removal from anthers (PREi) whereby the relative benefits of flower visitors to a component of a plant's male reproductive success can be quantified. 5. Comparisons of single bee visits to flowers with unvisited flowers and others receiving unlimited visits were used to show that: C. tarsata pollen collectors were more efficient than nectar collectors of either bee species at removing pollen from anthers; nectar collectors of both bee species had similar pollen removal efficiencies; C. tarsata was more efficient at depositing pollen on stigmas than A. mellifera; both bee species had statistically similar efficiencies at setting seed. 6. The indices of efficiency for some of the stages in the pollination of cashew suggest that C. tarsata flower visits may enhance plant reproductive success over flower visits by A. mellifera but that both bee species may be suitable for the pollination of commercially grown cashew. 7. Despite cashew's single ovule per flower, high nut set demands a high rate of pollinator visitation during the peak time of stigma receptivity. Provision of additional bee pollination in commercial orchards is recommended to obtain good nut yields.","Pollen deposition; Pollen removal; Pollinator efficiency; Stigma receptivity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031895050

Grooming behaviors examined included allogrooming and the grooming dance that involves self or autogrooming. Observation hives monitored over 24 h revealed that dancing increased significantly at night while allogrooming decreased. In 32 mite-infested observation hives the percentage of bees infested was positively correlated with allogrooming acts and dances observed. In a third experiment, young marked bees were introduced into three hives with 0, 50 and 70 % tracheal mite prevalence and grooming dances increased significantly in the bees 1-3 d of age in the mite-infested colonies. We postulate that mite movement on young bees elicits the grooming dance. Bees from four different single patrilines that had exhibited different propensities to allogroom or dance were marked and placed into eight mite-infested colonies for 5 d. Dissections of marked bees revealed that the allogrooming line was most susceptible and the dancing line least susceptible to mite infestation. We postulate that the dancing line of bees had a lower threshold for detecting mites on their body resulting in increased dance behavior and autogrooming, which we propose lowered the number of mites that transferred to these bees.

Workers fed royal jelly, pollen, and honey had large, medium, and small ovaries, respectively. Royal jelly had higher nutritive value for workers' ovarian development than did pollen, possibly because royal jelly is predigested by nurse bees and easily used by adult and larval bees. These results suggest that nurse bees could mediate workers' ovarian development in colonies via trophallactic exchange of royal jelly. Six levels of royal jelly in honey, 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% (royal jelly without honey), were tested for their effects on workers' ovarian development and mortality for 10 days. High levels of royal jelly increased ovarian development, but also increased worker mortality. All caged bees treated with 100% royal jelly died within 3 days. When workers were incubated at 20, 27, and 34°C for 10 days, only bees at 34°C developed ovaries.

The existence of morphological clines extending from the equator to the Polar Circle through Morocco and Spain raised the hypothesis that the branch M originated in Africa. Mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed that branches A and M were characterized by highly diverged lineages implying very remote links between both branches. It also revealed that mtDNA haplotypes from lineages A coexisted with haplotypes M in the Iberian Peninsula and formed a south-north frequency cline, suggesting that this area could be a secondary contact zone between the two branches. By analyzing 11 populations sampled along a France-Spain/Portugal-Morocco-Guinea transect at 8 microsatellite loci and the DraI RFLP of the COI-COII mtDNA marker, we show that Iberian populations do not present any trace of 'africanization' and are very similar to French populations when considering microsatellite markers. Therefore, the Iberian Peninsula is not a transition area. The higher haplotype A variability observed in Spanish and Portuguese samples compared to that found in Africa is explained by a higher mutation rate and multiple and recent introductions.

We calculated surrogates for these measures that are easier to obtain. An estimate (EM) of the number of mites in each sample was made using the ether roll technique. An estimate (EB) of the number of bees in each sample was estimated from the sample wet weight (G) by using a conversion factor (bees per gram). Surrogates for the 3 original measures were constructed using EM, EB, and G and compared with their corresponding original measures by using the concordance correlation coefficient rc.

Queens have predominantly 10-carbon ω-1-functionalized acids and workers have 10-carbon ω-functionalized acids. In previous work we have shown that the mandibular acids are synthesized from octadecanoic acid in three steps: (1) hydroxylation at the ω and ω-1 position; (2) β-oxidation of the 18- carbon hydroxy acids to the 8 and 10-carbon length; and (3) oxidation of the ω- and ω-1-hydroxy groups to give diacids and 9-keto-2(E)-decenoic acid, respectively. The last two steps are caste selective. In this work, we studied the biosynthesis of mandibular acids from acetate, distinguished among two possible routes of hydroxylation and studied caste differences in hydroxy acid chain shortening. Workers glands biosynthesize mandibular acids from acetate and, therefore, do not depend on an external source of octadecanoic acid. Hydroxylation at the ω position proceeds with retention of label at the ω-1 position. Hydroxylation at the ω-1 position proceeds with retention of label at the ω position and does not involve a terminal double bond. Finally, hydroxy acid chain shortening differs in queens and workers in two respects: (1) the inhibition pattern in the presence of 2- fluorooctadecanoic acid; and (2) reversibility. Chain shortening is inhibited by 2-fluorooctadecanoic acid to a greater extent in workers than in queens. Furthermore, workers are able to elongate hydroxy acids to the next higher 2- carbon homologue and are able to reduce hydroxy-2(E)-decenoic acids to the corresponding hydroxydecanoic adds. These transformations were not detected in queens.","β-Oxidation; Apis mellifera; Caste; Honey bee; Hydroxy acids; Hydroxylation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031959023

The most common explanation for this phenomenon involves a weak causal link between a worker's age and its occupation. However, available estimates of age effects are generally confounded with other sources of variability. Further, there is considerable variation in the age at which each task is performed. Consequently, the role of age in division of labor remains unresolved. An alternative model, christened 'foraging-for-work', explains age polyethism without a causal link between age and occupation. The specific algorithm, however, is too restrictive to apply in many task situations, and it is inconsistent with existing data on how workers actually locate and select tasks in certain contexts. Therefore, it cannot serve as a general model for task location/selection or for age polyethism. The model's conceptual basis, however, that an age-neutral mechanism can generate age polyethism, is an important contribution that demands further study. The current dialogue over proximate mechanisms of age polyethism has helped to clarify the pattern of behavioral ontogeny in honey bees. A conservative interpretation of existing data is that behavioral ontogeny is characterized by a nest phase followed by a foraging phase. The timing of the transition between these phases is determined more by the environment and physiological processes than by age. Whether nest tasks also follow a necessary sequence is less certain and requires further study.","Age polyethism; Apis mellifera; Division of labor; Emergent property; Self- organization; Social behavior; Social insects",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031966286

The length of the transect may obscure small biometric groups if the between- group variation is considerably larger than the within-group variation.

The drones and the queen consume but do not donate, while the workers are recipients and donors. They share the content of their crops and sometimes the products of their head glands. Such trophallactic interactions can frequently be seen non-randomly between all members of the colony. Their occurrence and success depend on factors such as sex and age of the consumers and donors, food availability and quality, time of day, weather and season. For the youngest workers, old workers, drones and the queen this flow-especially the flow of protein-has definite nutritional importance, since these bees need protein but have only a limited capacity to digest pollen and consume none or only small amounts of it. The system of trophallactic food flow and the existence of a specialised group, the nurses, who are responsible for consuming pollen and processing it as easily digestible jelly enables the colony to have many members with a reduced digesting capacity. The food storer bees specialise in transporting harvested nectar within the hive, receiving it from foragers near the entrance and depositing it in other parts of the hive where it is processed into honey. This saves time and helps the foragers to harvest available food sources more efficiently. In addition to its nutritional value and the importance of transfer to specialists, receiving and donating food in the trophallactic flow of food provides information to colony members about the quality and quantity of food existing in the hive and can therefore be compared in its importance with the dance language and communication by pheromones.","Apis mellifera; Division of labour; Language; Nutrition; Trophallaxis",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031977109

Because they were visited mostly at the end of their blooming season, and due to rainy days, not more than 5% of their entire season's flowers were exposed to sufficient pollination to set fruit. The late-blooming cultivars however, were visited by many bees and exhibited high initial fruit set. The attractiveness to honeybees of various avocado cultivars and some other plant species, which were found to compete for pollination, was measured by the coefficient 'r' obtained from correlations between bee density and reward measures of these plants, over the course of a day or season. At the beginning of the blooming season, the avocado flowers competed for nectar-foraging bees mainly with flowers of Citrus spp., and for pollen foragers with Brassicaceae and Fabaceae, all of which were more attractive to the bees.

When bees were fed sucrose, glucose, fructose and xylose (all 30 % w/w) and water only, survival on xylose was as poor as on water. With different glucose/xylose mixtures, survival time was inversely related to the proportion of xylose in the diet, each 5 % increment in xylose causing an additional increase in mortality. We conclude that the xylose in Protea and Faurea nectar is not there for the benefit of honeybees.","Honeybees; Nectar; Sugar preferences; Xylose",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032439603

Observations on the reproductive behavior of the mite have shown a well-structured spatial allocation of its activity using the bee or cell wall for different behaviors. The resulting advantages for the parasite of this subdivision of the concealed brood environment suggests an important role for chemostimuli in these substrates. Extracts of the European honey bee cocoons induce a strong arrestment response in the mite, as indicated by prolonged periods of walking on the extracts applied on a semipermeable membrane and by systematically returning to the stimulus after encountering the treatment borders. Two thin-layer chromatography fractions of the cocoon extract eliciting arrestment were found to contain saturated C17 to C22 primary aliphatic alcohols and C19 to C22 aldehydes. We analyzed extracts of the cocoon and different larvae, pupae, and adults of both worker and drone A. mellifera to determine the relative amounts of these chemostimuli in the different substrates employed by Varroa. Both aldehydes and alcohols were more abundant in the cocoon than in the cuticle of adult or developing bees. Mixtures of the aliphatic alcohols and aldehydes at the proportions found in the cocoons acted synergistically on the arrestment response, but this activity disappeared when mixed in equal amounts. When these oxygenated chemostimuli were mixed with C19 to C25 alkanes at the proportions found in the cocoon extract, we observed a significantly lower threshold for the chemostimulant mixture. These results indicate how Varroa may use mixtures of rarer products to differentiate between substrates and host stages during its developmental cycle within honey bee brood cells. © 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Alcohol; Aldehyde; Chemoreception; Chemostimulant; Cocoon; Honey bee; Hydrocarbon; Reproduction; Varroa",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001871418

The subgenual organ of the honeybee is suspended in a haemolymph channel in the tibia of each leg. When the leg accelerates, the inertia causes the haemolymph and the subgenual organ to lag behind the movement of the rest of the leg. To elucidate the biophysics of the subgenual organ system of the honeybee, 'two mathematical models to simulate the experimentally observed mechanical response are considered. The models are a classical mass-spring model and a newly developed tube model consisting of an open-ended, fluid-filled tube occluded by an elastic structure midway. Both models suggest that the subgenual organ included in the haemolymph channel resembles that of an overdamped system. In resembling the biophysics of the subgenual organ system in the honeybee, we consider the tube model to be the better of the two because it simulates a mechanical response which complies best with the experimental data, and the physical parameters in the model can be related to the constituent parts of the subgenual organ included in the haemolymph channel.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002989590

This study presents new data on the anatomy of one of these pathways, the stomatogastric nervous system (SNS) of honey bee larvae and pupae. Scanning electron microscopy preparations demonstrated not only developmental changes in frontal ganglion structure, but also provided firm evidence for a hypocerebral ganglion in the honey SNS. In addition to previously described SNS nerves, the frontal, recurrent and esophageal nerves, and the frontal connectives, we observed three new nerves that connect the SNS to the central nervous system and the foregut. The first one is an unpaired connective nerve of the frontal ganglion to the anteromedial protocerebrum. The second consists of paired lateral branches of the recurrent nerve, and the third is a plexus of fine nervous branches associated with the pharynx. Lateral extensions of the newly described hypocerebral ganglion also make contact with the pharynx. Similar but smaller branches were also observed to originate from the esophageal nerves as they run along the foregut. The exact anatomical localization of the cardiostomatogastric nerves, which connect the SNS with the retrocerebral complex, could also be detected. The description of such new nervous connections will serve as a database for functional analyses on the role of the SNS in differential feeding responses of the honey bee larvae, representing the initial step in caste differentiation.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031921862

Each mushroom body is composed of a medial and a lateral subunit. To understand their development, the proliferation pattern of mushroom body intrinsic cells, the Kenyon cells, were examined during larval and pupal stages using the bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) technique and chemical ablation with hydroxyurea. By larval stage 1, -40 neuroblasts are located in the periphery of the protocerebrum. Many of these stem cells divide asymmetrically to produce a chain of ganglion mother cells. Kenyon cell precursors underly a different proliferation pattern. With the beginning of larval stage 3, they are arranged in two large distinct cell clusters in each side of the brain. BrdU incorporation into newly synthesized DNA and its immunohistochemical detection show high mitotic activity in these cell clusters that lasts until mid-pupal stages. The uniform diameter of cells, the homogeneous distribution of BrdU-labeled nuclei, and the presence of equally dividing cells in these clusters indicate symmetrical cell divisions of Kenyon cell precursors. Hydroxyurea applied to stage 1 larvae caused the selective ablation of mushroom bodies. Within these animals a variety of defects were observed. In the majority of brains exhibiting mushroom body defects, either one mushroom body subunit on one or on both sides, or three or four subunits (e.g., complete mushroom body ablation) were missing. In contrast, partial ablation of mushroom body subunits resulting in small Kenyon cell clusters and peduncles was observed very rarely.

Cavity-nesting, solitary bee species were systematically monitored in wooden trap nests at 6 sites in northern central California from 1990 to 1992. Three sites were in the San Joaquin Valley in wildlife refuges or preserves; 3 were in coastal mountain or Sierran foothill parks or reserves. Differences in frequencies of nesting bees were observed and recorded among sites and habitats through time. A Poisson regression indicated that all explanatory variables and their 1st order interactions were highly significant. There were significant differences among bee taxa, sites and years, and their interactions (bee X site; bee X year; site X year). Megachile species were the predominant cavity nesters in the 3 valley sites; Osmia species were the common group in coastal mountain/foothill sites. In a computer simulation, using a variation of the Poisson regression, several significant differences were also observed between yearly frequency counts for certain bee species at the same site. Possible reasons for year to year changes included differential natural mortality, extreme annual weather patterns, use of marginal habitats, and negative impacts from exotic solitary bee species. Three exotic megachilids (Megachile rotundata (F.), M. apicalis Spinola, and M. concinna Smith) have successfully invaded and become established in California. Possibly, M. apicalis has affected other cavity nestingbee species, including the exotic M. rotundata in our Central Valley sites.","Bee conservation; Bee monitoring; Megachile; Megachilidae; Osmia; Trap nests",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000664567

The failure of bees to show this capacity in the majority of previous studies may be a result of the training procedure, because extensive training to one feeding site may have eliminated or weakened memories for other sites that were previously trained. Here we present a novel approach to this problem, by rewarding honey bees, Apis mellifera carnica, at two feeding sites, one (S(m), 630 m southeast from the hive) at which they could feed in the morning, and the other (S(a), 790 m northeast) at which they could feed in the afternoon. We then displaced bees to S(a) in the morning and to S(m) in the afternoon either from the other feeding site or from the hive. Bees were also displaced to two novel sites, one at a completely unfamiliar location (S4) and another that was located halfway between the two feeding sites (S3). Bees displaced from either of the feeding sites never took novel short cuts; instead, they used the homeward directions that would have been correct had they not been displaced. Bees caught at the hive entrance, however, chose the correct homeward direction not only when displaced to both feeding sites, but also when displaced to S3, although not from S4. Control bees that had been trained to only one of the feeding sites were not able to travel directly home from S3 excluding the possibility that bees used landmarks close to the hive. This is the first evidence that bees take a novel short cut by activating two vector memories simultaneously. The potential mechanisms of integrating the two memories are discussed. Since bees took novel short cuts in only one direction (to the hive) and only when displaced from the hive (not the feeders), we conclude that inference of a cognitive map in bees would be premature.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031980871

Flower constancy has been reported for various insects, but the degree of constancy seems to differ from species to species. To test the hypotheses that the degree of flower constancy depends on colony size and foraging strategy, flower constancy was measured in three species of stingless bees that differed in colony size and foraging strategies. When the artificial flower types differed in colour or odour, most bees preferred one of the two flower types. On average, 77% of successive visits were directed towards the previously visited flower type without major differences between the species. Constancy on odour was not generally overruled by constancy on colour or vice versa. When flower types differed in shape, the majority of the bees visited the two types in a random way. Thus, differences in colony size and foraging strategy did not relate to flower choice performance in the Trigona species. The degree of flower constancy in the stingless bee species studied was lower than that reported for European honey bees (Apis mellifera), but comparable with that reported for Asian honey bees (Apis cerana). We hypothesize that bees of tropical climates will be generally less constant than bees of temperate climates, due to different (environmentally imposed) optimal foraging strategies. © 1998 International Bee Research Association.","Flower constancy; Foraging strategies; Meliponinae; Stingless bees; Trigona fulviventris; Trigona fuscipennis; Trigona nigra",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032276591

This copy differs from a previously described copy in the positions of five introns and in 25% of the nucleotide sites in the coding regions. The existence of two paralogous copies of EF-1α in Drosophila and Apis suggests that two copies of EF-1α may be widespread in the holometabolous insect orders. To distinguish between a single, ancient gene duplication and parallel, independent fly and bee gene duplications, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of hexapod EF-1α sequences. Unweighted parsimony analysis of nucleotide sequences suggests an ancient gene duplication event, whereas weighted parsimony analysis of nucleotides and unweighted parsimony analysis of amino acids suggests the contrary: that EF-1α underwent parallel gene duplications in the Diptera and the Hymenoptera. The hypothesis of parallel gene duplication is supported both by congruence among nucleotide and amino acid data sets and by topology-dependent permutation tail probability (T-PTP) tests. The resulting tree topologies are also congruent with current views on the relationships among the holometabolous orders included in this study (Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera). More sequences, from diverse orders of holometabolous insects, will be needed to more accurately assess the historical patterns of gene duplication in EF- 1α.","Apis mellifera; Elongation factor-1α; Gene duplication; Insects; Intron/exon evolution; Phylogeny",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031941350

We first review the chemical structure and functions of queen mandibular pheromone (QMP), but then focus primarily on areas of potential future research interest. We discuss the mode of action that QMP may have on workers, address the issue of why QMP is a complex blend of five components, propose an evolutionary pathway for pheromone complexity in the genus Apis, discuss biochemical differences between worker and queen mandibular glands, review the evidence for additional queen pheromones besides QMP, examine how queen and brood pheromones interact to mediate colony biology, and discuss the relative importance of congestion and population size in pheromone transmission. Finally, we suggest some research areas that involve commercial applications of honey bee pheromones for beekeeping and crop pollination.","Apis mellifera; Colony integration; Primer pheromones; Queen pheromones",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031956927

Flower density was much more important than temperature, humidity, and time of day and season in explaining variation in bee numbers, the total number of flowers visited, the number of flowers visited by individual bees and the total number of visits per flower (visitation rate) during 10 min observation periods. Although flower density positively influenced bee abundance and the number of flowers visited by individual bees, we found a negative relationship between flower density and visitation rates, suggesting that the pool of available pollinators was saturated at flower densities below maximum. Despite this, visitation rates were high. On average a flower received 3.42 visits during one hour; thus there seems to be little intraspecific competition for pollinators despite saturation of the pollinator pool. There was no significant difference between the size or colour of flowers that were visited, approached, or ignored by bees, and duration of visits was not related to floral display size or colour. Thus, on average A. mellifera did not appear to discriminate between flowers on the basis of floral display. Consequently, the data indicate that there is no pollinator mediated selection on floral display, driven by discriminating pollinators.","Apis mellifera; Crocus vernus; Floral display; Flower density; Flower discrimination; Foraging; Norway; Pollination; Visitation rates; Weather",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032030301

In honey bee colonies, exposure to the wax comb is a critical component of the development of kin recognition cues. In this study, we determined how the cues develop under natural conditions (in swarms), whether the genetic source and age of the wax affect cue ontogeny, and whether exposure to wax, as in normal development, affects preferential feeding among bees within social groups. Cue development in swarms coincided with wax production, rather than with the presence of brood or the emergence of new workers; this finding supported previous observations concerning the importance of wax in cue ontogeny. Effective cue development required a match between the genetic source of the workers attempting to enter the hive, the wax to which they were exposed, and the guards at the hive entrance. The wax must also have been exposed to the hive environment for some time. Cues gained from wax did not mask or override cues used in preferential feeding interactions; this finding supports the contention that two recognition systems, one for nestmate recognition and the other for intra-colonial recognition, are present. The results fit a general model for cue development in nestmate recognition that relies on the use of nesting materials as an intermediary; the evolutionary significance of this model is discussed.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031959953

We explored whether there was genetic variation for assessment of pollen quality by foraging honey bees, Apis mellifera. Honey bees derived from two genotypic strains foraged for pollen of varying quality from a petri dish placed inside an outdoor flight cage. The strains were the result of a colony-level, two-way selection on amount of stored pollen. We used the forager's round dance to quantify the assessments of pollen quality by individually marked worker bees. The dance rate (number of 180°turns per minute) and the probability of dancing were each greater when bees foraged for pure pollen compared with a lower-quality mixture of pollen and alpha-cellulose (1:1 by volume). Bees from the high-pollen genotypic strain had a higher dance rate than those from the low-pollen strain, suggesting different assessments. Bees from the low-pollen strain, however, had a higher probability of dancing than did bees from the high-pollen strain. Dance duration was not affected by a bee's strain or by the quality of pollen. We conclude that the dance rate may be used to quantify a forager's subjective evaluation of pollen quality and that this evaluation has a genetic component.

These substances have shown to reduce mortality when administered to animals prior to exposure to a lethal dose of radiation. This fact is of considerable importance since it permits reduction of radiation-induced damage and provides prophylactic treatment for the damaging effects produced by radiotherapy. The following radioprotection mechanisms were proposed: free radical scavenger, repair by hydrogen donation to target molecules, formation of mixed disulfides, delay of cellular division and induction of hypoxia in the tissues. Radioprotective agents have been divided into four major groups: the thiol compounds, other sulfur compounds, pharmacological agents (anesthetic drugs, analgesics, tranquilizers, etc.) and other radioprotective agents (WR-1065, WR-2721, vitamins C and E, glutathione, etc.). Several studies revealed the radioprotective action of Apis mellifera honeybee venom as well as that of its components mellitin and histamine. Radioprotective activity of bee venom involves mainly the stimulation of the hematopoietic system. In addition, release of histamine and reduction in oxygen tension also contribute to the radioprotective action of bee venom.","Honeybee venom; Protective agents; Radiation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031964129

Cunn. ex Benth.) growing in Thailand are investigated using light and electron microscopy. The hybrid is andromonoecious. A floral spike consists of about 150 loosely arranged flowers. Flowers are cream coloured, fragrant and have no floral nectaries. The pistil has a solid style with a smooth, wet stigma and amphitropous ovules with immature integuments. The anther consists of eight loculi, each bearing only one 16-grain polyad. The flowers are weakly protogynous. Anthesis is complete at 0500-0600 h but peak female receptivity begins at 0200-0300 h and is completed that day. The stigmatic exudate is of the lipophilic type and is secreted from the stigmatic cells by a holocrine mechanism. Pollen is the main floral reward for the insect pollinators. There are several floral characteristics which facilitate pollen transfer from anthers and deposition on stigmas. Apis mellifera and Ceratina sp. are the most effective pollinators because they are the most common visitors and carry a heavy load of hybrid polyads. However, their behaviour in foraging for pollen in the same tree and weak protogynous dichogamy may promote self-pollination in the hybrid. The hybrid has low pollination success due to low pollinator number. An increase in exposure time of flowers to pollinators or pollinator number may increase pollination success but may not affect the rate of pollen deposition on stigmas due to the relatively small size of the stigma in relation to the polyad.","Acacia auriculiformis; Acacia hybrid; Acacia mangium; Anthesis; Pistil receptivity; Pollination; Pollinators",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031806551

In this study I explored how the individual workers responsible for building might use readily accessible local cues to acquire this global information on colony and environmental state. In particular, I tested the hypothesis that comb is built by nectar receivers (bees specialized to receive nectar from foragers and store it in Comb cells) that experience increased distension of their crops, crop distension could serve as a cue that both conditions for building have been satisfied, because the bees' crops will fill up as they receive nectar from successful foragers and have difficulty finding comb in which to store it. However, two findings led to rejection of this hypothesis. First, very few nectar receivers participated in comb building. Most builders came from another, unidentified subpopulation of workers. Second, potential builders showed no increase in crop size correlated with the onset of new comb construction or with the development of conditions that favour comb building. This was true both for identified nectar receiver bees and for bees belonging to the age cohort at which wax secretion and comb building reach their peak levels. The behavioural repertoire of comb-building bees suggests that these builders come from a pool of underemployed bees that may evaluate colony state by direct inspection of comb cells.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032167809

The highest rate of queen acceptance was obtained with the traditional method, which yielded 80.4% successful introductions. This method differed from the traditional plus hexadecane and from the traditional plus old queen rubbing methods, but was not different from the traditional plus vanilla essence method.

These results do not support the use of chemicals and queen substances to increase queen acceptance by workers in honey bee colonies. Therefore, it is suggested that beekeepers continue using the traditional methods of queen introduction, until more reliable methods are developed and tested.

Bees of two stocks, one more resistant (Buck-fast) and one more susceptible to tracheal mite infestation, were tested by performing amputations on uninfested, young (0–24 h) adult bees, exposing the treated bees to mites in infested colonies, then retrieving and dissecting the bees to measure parasitism. In both stocks, bees that had mesothoracic legs amputated had greatly increased mite abundances. However, the relative increase in infestation was greater in resistant bees. Mite infestation increased as more (0 vs. 1 vs. 2) mesothoracic legs were removed. In bees with only one leg removed, mite infestations were greater on the treated side. In subsequent tests with resistant stock bees only, removing the mesotarsi resulted in infestations equalling those found when entire mesothoracic legs were removed, but amputating the four distal mesotarsomeres or the metatarsi resulted in less significant increases. Restraining rather than removing mesothoracic legs also resulted in increased infestation. Young (0–24 h) bees were more affected than older (3–4 day) bees by leg removal, indicating that a factor other than autogrooming accounts for the low susceptibility of older bees to tracheal mites. Together these results are evidence that autogrooming is an important mechanism of protection against tracheal mites, especially in bees known to have genetically-based resistance to the parasite. © 1998 International Bee Research Association.","Acarapis woodi; Apis mellifera; Autogrooming; Honey bee; Resistance; Tracheal mites",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032347141

Honeybees rejected more than 80% of flowers probed by conspecifics less than 20 s previously, but less than 20% of flowers probed by bumblebees less than 20 s previously. Only if the previous bee was a conspecific or congener did the probability of a bee probing a flower increase with the time since the last probing visit. Otherwise, the probability of a bee probing was independent of the time elapsed since the last visit. Bees' reactions to flowers whose nectar content had been manipulated independently of prior visits suggested that bees were repelled from flowers by species- or genus-specific chemical cues deposited by previous bees. Laboratory studies elsewhere have reported that honeybees are repelled from artificial feeders by volatile bee-deposited chemicals. My results constitute strong evidence that such cues are used by nectar-collecting honeybees in the field, and also suggest that bumblebees respond to similar cues. Calculations show that the ability to detect recently visited flowers may help bees to make a foraging profit, especially when bee densities are high.

We explored the role of queen mandibular gland pheromone (QMP) in initiating balling behaviour. The addition of a synthetic blend of QMP to the abdomen of worker bees initiated balling behaviour of these workers when re-introduced into their own colony. There was a positive, dose-dependent relationship between the number of balls formed, time to ball formation and size of balls formed. When the QMP dose was below that normally found on a queen, 10−3 queen equivalents, it resulted in significantly slower ball formation and smaller ball diameter. The acid components of the five-component QMP elicited balling behaviour while the aromatic components did not, but the full blend elicited the strongest response. Stinging behaviour was the most prevalent and persistent factor preceding the formation of balls. We concur with others who have proposed that a ‘marking’ pheromone is released when an aggressive worker flexes her abdomen, and that the release of this pheromone causes ball formation. There were no obvious changes in resident queen behaviour while balling of QMP-treated workers was occurring. We conclude that queen mandibular gland pheromone is a significant signal in foreign queen recognition and the initiation of balling behaviour. © 1998 International Bee Research Association.","Apis mellifera; Balling behaviour; Honey bees; Queen mandibular gland pheromone",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032352286

Conversely, both honey bees and bumblebees, Bombus spp., can mark rewarding flowers with scent marks that promote probing by conspecifics. We examined detection of recently visited flowers in a mixed community of bumblebees foraging on comfrey, Symphytum officinale, in southern England. When foraging among inflorescences on a plant, three abundant species of Bombus probed fewer inflorescences more than once than would be expected from random foraging. Bees frequently encountered inflorescences but departed without probing them for nectar. Examination of the incidence of such rejections in the two most common species, B. terrestris and B. pascuorum, revealed that the low incidence of multiple probing visits was due to two factors: bees both foraged systematically and selectively rejected inflorescences that they had previously visited. When presented with inflorescences of known history, bees selectively rejected those that had been recently visited by themselves or by conspecifics compared with randomly selected inflorescences. They were also able to distinguish inflorescences that had been visited by other Bombus species. Bees were unable to distinguish and reject inflorescences from which the nectar had been removed artificially.

Significantly, the subfamily that laid eggs when the queen was present did not contribute to the drone production when the colony was queenless. However, another subfamily contributed a disproportionately large number of drones. The frequency of worker oviposition appears to be determined by opposing selective forces. Individual bees benefit from personal reproduction, whereas other bees and the colony are disadvantaged by it. Thus a behavioral polymorphism can be maintained in the population in which some workers can escape worker policing, with balancing selection at the colony level to detect and eliminate these mutations.","Anarchy; Apis mellifera; Kin selection; Laying workers; Social insects; Worker policing",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031789574

Statistical differences were found between the age distributions of the swarm and the parental colony, the scouts and the swarm, and the scouts and the foragers. The median age of the swarm bees was lower than that of the colony bees, that of the scouts was higher than that of the swarm bees, and that of the scouts was slightly less than that of the foragers.

The total sugar content of nectar samples was measured by the Dreywood anthrone reaction for total carbohydrate, and simple sugar composition was determined using an enzymatic bioanalysis for D-glucose, D-fructose and sucrose. Hybrid and open-pollinated cultivar flowers had similar sugar content. Mean total sugar content per flower also did not vary among hybrid breeding systems when compared within individual weeks of the bloom period or within daily sampling periods. However, for all cultivars, total nectar sugar content per flower was lower during the 08:00 and 11:00 h sampling periods and increased to maximum levels during the 14:00 and 16:00 h sampling periods. Significant differences in nectar sugar content were also found in relation to the bloom phenology of the cultivars. Cultivars produced the greatest amount of sugar per flower during the first 2 wk of the bloom period, then sugar production decreased in the third and fourth weeks. Nectar sugar ratios from all cultivars averaged approximately 1:1 glucose:fructose. Nectar glucose content among cultivars was similar but, among breeding systems, CMS cultivars tended to have lower amounts of glucose than SI or open-pollinated cultivars. Selecting for higher total sugar content may produce nectars more attractive to foraging honeybees (Apis mellifera L.), thereby ensuring adequate pollination of hybrid parental lines and F1 hybrid plants. Selecting for lower nectar glucose will produce honeys with more desirable granulation characteristics. Overall, the production and quality of nectar sugar in oilseed rape hybrids are similar to those of open-pollinated cultivars, and are not likely to adversely affect the pollinating activities of honeybees or their potential for honey production.","Apis mellifera; Brassica napus; Honeybees; Nectar; Oilseed summer rape; Simple sugars",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031862701

Comparisons were based on fruit abortion rates and seed set as influenced by bee type (honey bee or bumble bee) and the number of bee visits to treatment flowers (1, 6, 12, and 18 bee visits), plus two controls: a no visit treatment and an open-pollinated (unrestricted visitation) treatment. For both crops, an increased number of bee visits had a strong positive effect on fruit and seed set. All cucumber and watermelon flowers bagged to prevent insect visitation aborted, demonstrating the need for active transfer of pollen between staminate and pistillate flowers. Bumble bee-visited flowers consistently had lower abortion rates and higher seed sets in the cucumber and watermelon studies than did honey bee-visited flowers when compared at the same bee visitation level. Only slight differences in fruit abortion rates were detected between bee types in the watermelon study, However, abortion rates for bumble bee-visited flowers were consistently less than those for honey bee-visited flowers when compared at equal bee visitation levels with one exception at the 12 bee visit level. As the number of honet bee colonies continues to decline due to parasitic mite pests and based on the data obtained, we conclude that bumble bees have a great potential to serve as a supplemental pollinator for cucumbers, watermelons, and possibly other vine crops, when honey bees available for rental are in limited supply.","Apis mellifera; Bombus impatiens; Citrullus lanatus; Cucumis sativus; Fruit and seed set; Pollination",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031783163

The sex ratio of reproductive individuals ≥ 10 cm diameter at breast height was about 1:1 and departures from this ratio mostly resulted from a higher proportion of the males. Spatially, the sexes were randomly distributed but generally within 10 m of each other with no obvious gender differences in size. Throughout Malawi, male and female reproductive individuals flower synchronously between October-April (with a peak period in February-March). A 6: 1 male to female inflorescence sex ratio was common. Anthesis in female inflorescences lasts almost twice as long as in male inflorescences and only the latter have any odour. On male trees, inflorescences are in fascicles, whereas on female trees, they are solitary. In both cases, the infloresences are generally similar in size except for the peduncles of the male inflorescences which are longer than the female's. A range of insects visits U. kirkiana flowers but the most likely pollinators are bees (Apis mellifera), and beetles (Dothera bennigseni, Chelomenes lunata, Alcidodes denticulatus and Mitracamenta sp.). Apart from pollen from the male inflorescences, female flowers do not offer any obvious reward for flower visitors. Pollination studies revealed that assisted pollination did not significantly improve fruit production or seed quality over unpollinated or naturally pollinated inflorescences. Facultative agamospermy (apomixis) is suspected as a phenomenon requiring further attention in U. kirkiana.","Anthesis; Conspecific neighbours; Dioecious; Fruit production; Inflorescence; Phenology; Reproductive biology; Sex ratio; Uapaca",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032413124

The role of these sources of information in decision-making by foragers was studied observatinally and experimentally in stingless bees of the genus Melipona. Once a Melipona forager had started its foodcollecting career, its decisions to initiate, continue or stop its daily collecting activity were mainly based upon previous experience (activity on previous days, the tiem at which foraging was initiated the days(s) before, and during the day, the success of the last foraging flights) and mediated through direct interaction with the food source (load isze harvestedand time to collect a load). External information provided by returning foragers advanced the strt of foraging of experienced bees. Most inexperienced bees initiated their foragign day after successful foragers had returned to the hive. The start of foraging by other inexperinced bees was stimulated by high waste-removal activity of nest mates. By experimetnally controlling the entries offoragers (hence external information input) it was shown that very low levels of external inforamtion input had large effects on the departure of experienced foragers. After the return of a single successful forager, or five foragers together, the rate of forager exits increased dramatically for 15 min. Only the first and second entry events had large effect; later entries influence forager exit patterns only slightly. The results shows that Melipona foragers make decisions based upon their own experience and that communication stimulates these foragers if it concerns the previously visited source. We discuss the organisation of individual foraging in Melipona and Apis mellifera and are led to the conclusion that these species behave very similarly and that an information-integration model (derived from Fig. 1) could be a starting point for future research on social insect foraging.","Communication; Decision-making; Foraging; Learning; Melipona",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031925647

The experiments were conducted with single-cohort colonies, composed entirely of young bees, allowing us to quickly distinguish the development of new (precocious) foragers from increases in activity of bees already competent to forage. In experiment 1, colony food shortage caused an acceleration of behavioral development; a significantly greater proportion of bees from starved colonies than from fed colonies became precocious foragers, and at significantly younger ages. Temporal aspects of this starvation effect were further explored in experiment 2 by feeding colonies that we initially starved, and starving colonies that we initially fed. There was a significant decrease in the number of new foragers in starved colonies that were fed, detected 1 day after feeding. There also was a significant increase in the number of new foragers in fed colonies that were starved, but only after a 2-day lag. These results suggest that colony nutritional status does affect long-term behavioral development, rather than only modulate the activity of bees already competent to forage. In experiment 3, we uncoupled the nutritional status of a colony from that of the individual colony members. The behavior of fed individuals in starved colonies was indistinguishable from that of bees in fed colonies, but significantly different from that of bees in starved colonies, in terms of both the number and age distribution of foragers. These results demonstrate that effects of starvation on temporal polyethism are not mediated by the most obvious possible worker-nest interaction: a direct interaction with colony food stores. This is consistent with previous findings suggesting the importance of worker-worker interactions in the regulation of temporal polyethism in honey bees as well as other social insects.","Behavioral development; Behavioral plasticity; Division of labor; Foraging behavior; Temporal polyethism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031835182

Here we examine the ability of honeybees to gauge distance travelled when visual input is available primarily to one eye. Bees were trained to fly into a tunnel, lined with textured patterns, to collect a reward at a feeder placed at a certain distance. Their ability to estimate distance flown was then assessed by testing them in a fresh tunnel without the feeder. The results show that (1) bees can estimate distance flown under monocular conditions, performing nearly as accurately as when information is available to both eyes; (2) bees can learn to fly two different distances, where each distance is measured in terms of the image motion experienced by a different eye; and (3) bees that have acquired information on the distance to a food source using one eye can measure out the same distance when they are required to use the other (naive) eye. The need to measure distance using signals from a single eye becomes important when a bee flies to a food source along the face of a cliff or the edge of a forest. Furthermore, under such conditions, it is important to be able to deal with odometric signals that are transposed interocularly when the bee returns home from the food source. This is because, although distances are learnt primarily on the way to a food source, foraging bees monitor distance flown on the homebound as well as the outbound routes.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032213783

Hygienic bees uncap and remove diseased and parasitized brood from the nest. The propagation of colonies that demonstrate resistance to chalkbrood and American foulbrood and that remove pupae infested by Varroa mites is becoming increasingly important in apiculture. This study evaluates 2 commonly used field assays used to screen colonies for hygienic behavior: the freeze-killed brood and the pierced brood assays. Both involve determining the time required for worker bees to remove dead capped brood from a section of comb. Colonies in the experiment displayed a wide range of removal rates and were grouped as hygienic, nonhygienic, or intermediate. The results of experiments 1 and 2 indicated that neither the age nor the source of the frozen brood had a significant effect on the removal rate by hygienic colonies (i.e., those colonies that consistently uncapped and removed freeze-killed brood within 48 h). In experiment 3, only a weak correlation was found between the removal of young freeze-killed and pierced pupae, but a significant correlation existed between the removal of pre-eclosion freeze-killed and pierced pupae. Experiment 4 examined cues that elicit removal behavior by hygienic and nonhygienic colonies. When pupae were pierced with an insect pin through the base of the cell (without piercing the wax cell capping), there was no difference in the number of pupae removed by the hygienic and nonhygienic colonies. On average, 30% of all pierced pupae survived the treatment, which considerably diminished the accuracy and reproducibility of the test When pupae were treated with hemolymph extracted from either a live or freeze-killed pupa there was also no difference in the rate of removal by hygienic and nonhygienic colonies. These results indicate that bees from nonhygienic lines can be induced to express hygienic behavior only if a sufficiently strong stimulus is present. Both hygienic and nonhygienic colonies removed significantly more pupae treated with hemolymph from a dead pupa than hemolymph from a live pupa, indicating that the cue that stimulates removal behavior is stronger in dead pupae. It is concluded that the freeze-killed brood assay is the most conservative and reliable screening procedure for hygienic behavior. The following procedures are recommended: Randomly selected comb sections (5 by 6 cm each) of capped brood should be cut from 1 healthy colony, frozen, and introduced into the test colonies. The assay should be repeated at least twice. Only colonies that remove >95% of freeze-killed brood within 48 h in both tests should be considered hygienic. When developing hygienic breeder stock, the hygienic colonies should be challenged with the American foulbrood or chalkbrood pathogen to ensure resistance.","Chalkbrood; Honey bee hygienic behavior; Varroa",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001944998

For tinctures, the estimations of total phenolic substances, flavonoids, waxes, specific gravity and ethanol are proposed. Total phenolic substances and flavonoids are measured by spectrophotometric methods, waxes gravimetrically and ethanol by gas chromatography. The accuracy of the spectrophotometric procedures was tested by assaying a mixture with a known composition of phenolic acids and flavonoids. The use of the procedures is exemplified by the analyses of six samples of crude propolis from different localities in Brazil and of tinctures prepared with absolute and 70% aqueous ethanol. The contents of total phenolic substances, flavonoids, waxes and volatile compounds of the samples analysed are relatively low in comparison with data from the literature.

Therefore conflicts among colony members are expected. This paper analyzes the empirical evidence of these conflicts in sex ratio, nepotism in queen rearing, and worker production of males. Sex ratio conflict is expected to be minimal and hard to measure in honey bees, but behavioral studies might provide insights. Nepotism in queen rearing has been investigated by several studies. The weight of the evidence suggests that weak nepotism does occur. This paper provides a reanalysis of the data of one controversial study and compares the methods and results of others. Mixed negative and positive findings may be due to certain methodological differences, or to polymorphism for this trait. Worker laying is much more common than has long been thought, but nonetheless nearly all adult drones derive from the queen, because worker policing removes nearly all worker- laid eggs. Policing, both of eggs laid and worker ovary development, also may be responsible for complete sterility of most workers. Thus reproductive cooperation in honey bees is underlain by a low level of active conflict.","Apis mellifera; Kin recognition; Nepotism; Social behavior; Worker laying",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031967722

The Golgi apparatus consists of several hundred individual stacks of cisternae dispersed throughout the soma of the photoreceptor cell. Two distinct subpopulations of Golgi stacks are distinguishable by their topographic features: (1) a dense row of Golgi stacks is aligned along the palisade-like cisternae of smooth endoplasmic reticulum backing the photoreceptive microvilli; (2) other Golgi stacks are scattered in the remainder of the cell body. The spatial relationship of Golgi stacks to microtubules and actin filaments has also been determined. Electron-microscopic examination of high-pressure-frozen freeze-substituted retinae reveals that Golgi stacks backing the submicrovillar endoplasmic reticulum reside in a cell area without microtubules, whereas the second subpopulation of Golgi stacks is embedded amidst microtubules. Labeling studies with several actin-specific probes, viz., rhodamine phalloidin, monoclonal anti-actin antibodies, and myosin fragments, provide evidence for a juxtaposition of the submicrovillar Golgi stacks to actin filaments. The Golgi membranes are thus ideally positioned to facilitate the transport of Golgi-derived material toward the microvilli along actin filaments.","Actin filaments; Apis mellifera (Insecta); Cytoskeleton; Golgi complex; Membrane dynamics; Microtubules; Photoreceptor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031940485

Bees are able to distinguish between related and non-related individuals, so one aim of this study was to determine whether drifting also depends on relatedness. In addition we wanted to examine whether there are differences in survival of drifted bees and non-drifted bees and to model the component of alien worker bees in a colony's population. We used two non-related strains of bees. The colonies stood in rows. Each of the colonies had two non-related neighbour colonies, except for the colonies on the ends of the rows. From each colony, 200 newly emerged bees were marked individually and 100 of them were reintroduced into their original colony (native bees) and 100 into a non-related neighbouring colony (foreign bees). The marked bees were examined for presence on their 2(nd), 6(th), 9(th), 16(th), 25(th) and 34(th) day of life. Experiments were done in summer and fall. There was no difference in survival and the amount of drifting of native and foreign bees. We also found no differences in the number of drifting bees for the two non-related strains. The bees never preferred related colonies when drifting. Bees of strain 1 did not show any preferences. In two experiments significantly more bees of strain 2 drifted into colonies of strain 1. Most bees drifted into the neighbouring colony next to the colony they left. In summer significantly more bees that had drifted until their 9(th) day of life, survived until the 25(th) day than bees that did not drift until that day. In fall we did not find this difference. This was true for bees of both strains. Our data support the results of Jay (1965), who found that more bees drift from a centre colony to the end colonies of a row than vice versa. With a model we calculated the component of alien worker bees living in a colony's population. On average, 22±3% alien worker bees were calculated for edge and 42±6% for inner hives in a row in our first experiment (summer). In a second experiment (fall) the components were 13±1% for the edge colonies and 39±4% for the inner colonies in the row. Drifting seems not to be influenced by relatedness and did not shorten the lifetime of the bees. This indicates a great tolerance against drifted bees and a high intermix of an apiary's population when no precautions to reduce drifting are taken.","Drifting; Honey bees; Population model; Relatedness; Survival",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031842096

There are genotypic differences in rate of behavioral development, which predispose individuals to respond to changing conditions in predictable ways. For example, genotypes that have relatively fast rates of behavioral development under more typical conditions are more inclined to show precocious foraging in the absence of foragers of normal age. Juvenile hormone influences rate of behavioral development, and environmentally induced changes in JH titers are thought to underlie changes in age polyethism. Results of recent experiments indicate that changes in the age at onset of foraging caused by changes in colony age demography are at least partially a consequence of social interactions in which older bees inhibit the rate of behavioral development of younger bees. Chemical signals are suspected to feature prominently in these interactions, and preliminary evidence supporting this notion is presented.","Apis mellifera; Behavioral genetics; Chemical communication; Juvenile hormone",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031955870

It is shown that Varroa can use single clean-air puffs and bee-odour plumes in a wind tunnel as directional cues. Varroa turned nearly straight upwind in response to single 0.1-s puffs of clean air directed at 90°to the their anterior-posterior axis. They turned significantly further to their left side (104°) than to their right (76°), but showed no difference in latency to initiation of the turns (means of 63.3 ms vs. 62.6 ms, respectively). They also followed bee-odour plumes in a wind tunnel. When released in odour and control plumes mid-way between the plume's origin and the downwind end of the tunnel, mites responding to bee-odour walked upwind in, or along the edge of, the odour plume with 38% making contact with the odour delivery tube; mites in clean air did not walk upwind along the air stream, and none made contact with the air delivery tube. Walking speeds were not different between the bee-odour and control groups (0.28 vs. 0.29 cm s-1); there were also no differences in the turning rates (96.85 vs. 97.16 deg s-1 and 388.08 vs. 379.18 deg cm-1, respectively).

We compared the response sof different behavioral castes by inducing a bee to sting and then assessing the response of that bee to other bees; after stinging, guard bees displayed heightened activity, but soldiers, foragers, or hive bees did not.

The sterile workers fulfill the role of the somatic cells in organisms with intricate and complex interactions. These interactions are under partial control of hierarchical signals (pheromones) which are primarily used for global information of the colony. The majority of the activities in the colony is, however, regulated through local decision making and through self-organized processes which are regulated through worker threshold response variability. In honeybees this is enhanced through the highly polyandrous mating system which allows for wide genotypic variance and the presence of genetic specialists. Although both individual and colony level selection can be observed in honeybees the latter seems to be the predominant selective force. This is similar to organismic selection where selection among or within cells is less relevant to evolutionary processes than fitness at the organismic level.","Apis mellifera; Division of labor; Polyandry; Self- organization; Social organization; Superorganism",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031956456

Amitraz, coumaphos and fluvalinate were added to acaricide-free wax at 0, 1, 10, 100 ppm each and the wax subsequently was used to produce comb foundation. Amitraz could not be recovered from the foundation, but foundation where coumaphos and fluvalinate had been added to the wax contained approximately the added residue levels. When mites were allowed to enter brood in combs made from this foundation, the effect from coumaphos residues was dramatic. Almost all mother mites died in combs where 100 ppm coumaphos had been added to the foundation and increased mother mite mortality occurred at the 10-ppm level. An effect from fluvalinate was only seen in combs drawn from foundation with 100 ppm fluvalinate. If one brood generation had been present prior to the brood attacked by the mites, no harmful effects to mites from wax contaminants were found, even at the highest contamination levels. This result is probably due to the honey bee cocoon acting as a barrier for acaricide transfer from the wax to the mites in the cells. It is concluded that studies of mite fertility probably do not need to consider if the wax is contaminated with up to 10 ppm of fluvalinate. At 100 ppm in the wax the effect from this acaricide on mite performance is detectable but not dramatic. However, comb drawn from foundation having 10 ppm or more coumaphos, and in which no brood was reared, dramatically reduced mother mite survival. Since frozen combs are often used when mite fertility is investigated, coumaphos in the wax may distort results at contamination levels found in European wax. © 1998 International Bee Research Association.","Acaricides; Amitraz; Beeswax; Coumaphos; Fluvalinate; Residues; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032328844

When an infested bee was dead or dying, up to 75% of the mites would transfer to a live bee within 24 h. When their host died, mites would remain on the dead bee, provided an alternative bee was not available, for an average of 48 ± 26.5 h before dismounting. During this time they continued to feed and exhibited behaviour which would enhance their chances of transfer to a new host.

Data from our observations of individual bees bolster the hypothesis that the shaking signal informs workers to prepare for a higher level of activity. We followed foragers in a colony whose only source of 'nectar' was a sugar-water feeder and discovered that when the feeder was left empty for 1-3 d and then refilled, the first bees to find the food initially produced only shaking signals upon return to the hive.

The structure-activity relationships of acetamiprid homologues and 3-pyridylmethylamines (known as the essential structural requirement of nicotinoid) are compared in terms of the affinity to the [3H]α- bungarotoxin (α-BGT) site (designated as ACh site) and the [3H]phencyclidine (PCP) site [designated as noncompetitive blocker (NCB) site] of the insect nAChR from the honeybee heads. Increasing the chain length of alkyl substituents (from methyl to n-butyl) on an amino nitrogen atom of acetamiprid homologue and 3-pyridylmethylamine reduces the potency as inhibitors of [3H]α-BGT binding, whereas it confers the enhanced potency as inhibitors of [3H]PCP binding in the insect nAChR. Scatchard analysis reveals that homologues of acetamiprid and 3-pyridylmethylamine having n-butyl substituents interact with the high-affinity binding site for [3H]PCP, which is considered to be the NCB site located in the ion channel of the insect nAChR. The interaction of acetamiprid homologues with the ACh or NCB site of nAChR is selective for insects, while that of the 3-pyridylmethylamines is effective for both insect and Torpedo [Tomizawa et al., J Pesticide Sci 21:412-418 (1996)].

Blandus, Densiflorus, Hebea, Heterocolon, Homoglossum, Linearifolius, Ophiolyza) show that 42 species are pollinated largely by polylectic bees in the family Apidae, 2 species by bees of the families Andrenidae or Halictidae, and 1 by a combination of hopliine beetles (Scarabaeidae) and Andrenidae. The floral phenology, attractants, diversity of floral foragers, and sometimes the rewards, vary according to geography and are not correlated with taxonomy. Flowering in most Gladiolus species in the southern African winter-rainfall zone coincides with the end of the wet season, August to October, but a few flower from February to April at the end of the dry season. They have sweetly fragrant flowers with a wide range of colors and markings. These species receive a diversity of floral foragers including bees in the genera Allodape, Amegilla, Andrenu, Anthophora, Apis, and Pachymelus. Most Gladiolus species of the summer-rainfall zone flower from December to April, from the middle to the end of the wet season, but a few species bloom from August to November, at the end of the dry season. Their flowers have no discernible fragrance and are colored mostly in shades of pink to mauve or white. Most floral foragers collected on these species were bees in the genus Amegilla, but other bee genera, as well as flies in the genera Prosoeca and Stenobasipteron, were captured. Among the southern African species of Gladiolus pollinated by bees, there are two distinct pollination strategies. The majority have bilabiate, 'gullet' flowers or 'flag' flowers that secrete sucrose-rich nectar at the base of an obliquely funnel-shaped floral tube 9-20 mm long with the lower, narrow part 5-15 mm long. Apis mellifera and large-bodied anthophorine bees (especially Amegilla and Anthophora) contact dehiscent anthers and/or receptive stigmas while probing the tube for nectar with elongated probosces. In contrast, G. brevitubus, G. quadrangularis, and G. stellatus have rotate, actinomorphic (or subactinomorphic) perianths offering little or no nectar at the base of tubes less than 7 mm long. Andrenu species or Apis mellifera contact both dehiscent anthers and receptive stigmas of G. stellatus or G. quadrangularis, respectively, while foraging for pollen. An additional 53 Gladiolus species also have bilabiate, gullet or flag flowers with obliquely funnel-shaped tubes 9-20 mm long (the most common flower type in the genus), and are presumed also to be adapted for pollination by long-tongued anthophorine and honey bees. The actinomorphic, rotate floral form is present in 2 more species. Thus, 60% of the Gladiolus species in southern Africa may be regarded as being pollinated by bees, and the overwhelming majority of these species (95%) have gullet or flag flowers and are visited primarily by long-tongued anthophorine bees that are foraging for nectar. The remaining species of Gladiolus in southern Africa have flowers with elongate perianth tubes and are adapted for pollination by sunbirds or insects other than bees, most importantly long-tongued flies (Nemestrinidac, Tabanidae), moths, and the large satyrid butterfly, Aeropetes.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032407728

Thermorégulation of elevated thorax temperatures is necessary for bees to achieve the high rates of power production required for flight, and is a key factor allowing them to occupy widely varying thermal environments. However, the mechanisms by which bees thermoregulate during flight are poorly understood. Thermorégulation is accomplished by balancing heat gain and heat loss via the following routes: convection, evaporation, and metabolic heat production. There appears to be a diversity of thermoregulatory mechanisms employed during flight among bee species. Some species, particularly Bambus spp., actively increase the distribution of thoracic heat to the abdomen during flight as air temperature (Ta) rises, and apparently thermoregulate by varying convective heat loss. However, thermal variation in convection has not been directly measured for any free-flying bee. Above 33°C, flying Apis mellifera greatly increase evaporative heat loss with Ta, and many other species ""tongue-lash"" during flight at high Tas or when artificially heated. Thus, evaporation seems to be important for preventing overheating during flight at very high Tas. Flying A. mellifera and Centris pallida strongly decrease metabolic rate as Ta increases, suggesting that they are varying metabolic heat production for thermorégulation and not aerodynamic requirements. Variation in metabolic heat production appears to be mediated by changes in wingbeat kinematics, since wingbeat frequency decreases with Ta for A. mellifera and Centris spp. It is unknown if the decrease in flight metabolic rate at higher Tas occurs secondarily as a consequence of greater efficiency or if it is truly an active response.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-22044444710

The threshold of responsiveness to the noxious stimulus increased when bees were previously stimulated with isopentyl acetate, which is a main component of the alarm pheromone of the sting chamber. This effect is antagonised by previous injection of naloxone-hydrochloride (Endo Laboratories Inc.). Results suggest that in the honeybee an endogenous opioid system activated by isopentyl acetate is responsible for modulation of perception for nociceptive stimuli. The resulting stress-induced analgesia in the defender bee would reduce its probability of withdrawal thus increasing its efficiency against enemies.","Alarm pheromone; Honeybees; Opioid system; Stinging response; Stress-induced analgesia",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343923727

The effect of wintering method on population decreases of colonies was highly significant (P<0.01 ) in first year; but it was not significant in second year. However, it was found that the effect of interaction between hive type and wintering method on population decrease was not significant. The average food consumptions of colonies in wooden hives were higher than those of colonies in styrofoam hives, which might be due to less population decrease of colonies in wooden hives. As a result, wooden hives should be used for wintering to reduced the colony losses and bee mortality in the surviving colonies in Ezurum conditions. It was found that overwintering colonies outdoor without taking any precaution was not economic. Wintering colonies indoor or under a shed should be prefered to the wintering outdoor to reduce food consumption and bee losses. Temperature fluctuations during winter period increased food consumption of the colonies considerably.","Honeybee (Apis mellifera L.); Wintering; Wintering losses",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031537988

Sixty-eight beekeepers (87.1%) showed restricted local clinical reactions; nine individuals (11.5%) had extensive local reactions, and only one (1.2%) suffered anaphylactic shock. The humoral immunologic pattern of these individuals were studied by using immunoenzymatic methods to determine the serum titles of specific IgE and specific IgG4. Three groups of beekeepers presenting different humoral immunologic patterns were identified, in which the predominant pattern was the absence of specific IgE and high levels of specific IgG4 (38.4%). There was a positive correlation between the high levels of specific IgG4 and the number of bee stings. This correlation was not found in either specific or total IgE. The results of the present study suggest: i) the immunologic response to the number of exposures to Africanized honeybee venom is not related to the number of exposures; and, ii) other nonhumoral and/or nonimmunologic factors may be involved in the reaction to the insect sting, which are responsible for both the clinical symptoms and protection.","Acquired immunity; Africanized honeybee venom; Apis mellifera; Beekeepers; Specific IgE and IgG4",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031439366

Using [1-14C] sodium acetate as a precursor, it was shown that in vivo, esters and hydrocarbons comprised the major de novo products. The relative proportion of the hydrocarbon fraction was significantly higher in mated queens than in virgins, while in esters the situation was reversed. Comparision between reproductive and non reproductive virgin queens revealed that mating and not egg laying induced changes in glandular activity. Glands incubated in vitro, on the other hand, synthesized mainly esters and alcohols but not hydrocarbons. These results suggest that either hydrocarbons are produced elsewhere and subsequently sequestered by Dufour's gland, or that the gland biosynthetic expression in vivo is modulated. Differences between the gland activity in vivo and in vitro further support the hypothesis of a physiological mechanism in regulation of glandular performance.","Biosynthesis; Dufour's gland; Esters; Honey bee; Hydrocarbons; Queens",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031350116

Whiting, found multiple alleles in Bracon xo that are the Rosetta stone of sex determination in Hymenoptera. Whiting also discovered that some species of microhymenoptera do not possess xo sex alleles. Therefore, Hymenoptera apparently presents two types of sex determination superimposed on haplodiploidy. In the panmictic groups hemizygous (xo1,xo2,...xo(n)) and homozygous (xo1xo1,xo2xo2...xo(n)xo(n)) are males while heterozygous (xo1xo2,...x(n-1)xo(n)) are females. There is no such series of xo(n) in endogamous Hymenoptera, since the constant elimination of diploid males would be damaging to the population and the mutation of xo to xo(n) would be quickly eliminated. Besides the Whiting hypothesis, four others are discussed. The new hypothesis of genomic imprinting, of Beukeboom, is eliminated since: a) spermatozoa that develop within the egg produce male tissue; b) telitokous parthenogenesis due to the fusion of two haploid cells develop into females; c) last instar larvae treated with juvenile hormone become queens. The Cunha and Kerr hypothesis (female determining genes are totally or partially additive and male determination is totally or partially nonadditive) explains all known cases. The xo is a female determining gene. Sex determination in social bees led to the gradual evolution of two systems of caste determination: one in which queens and workers are similar and males are very different (Apinae), and another in which workers and males are very similar and both very different from the queens (Meliponinae). This second system in stingless bees implies that many of the mutations that improve worker capacities also affect the males that will carry out some activities that in Apis are clearly female ones. Ten of these activities are described.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031453355

The present studies investigated the existence of an as-yet unidentified, brood-associated signal that acts in conjunction with the queen's mandibular pheromone to suppress queen rearing. When we manipulated the levels of synthetic queen mandibular gland pheromone (QMP) and young brood in queenless colonies, there was a 50% reduction in the number of queen cells reared compared to colonies receiving QMP alone. In a second experiment, colonies containing eggs and young larvae but no QMP reared on average only one queen cell after 24 h, while colonies containing older lapse reared four queen cells, suggesting that combs with younger brood were the source of the second signal. In a third experiment, we attempted to induce queen rearing in the presence of the queen by removing eggs and young larvae in colonies with healthy queens. Six of nine brood-manipulated colonies initiated queen cells, compared with only one of nine colonies receiving a sham manipulation. The results from this experiment suggest that a decline in the brood signal initiated queen supersedure in honey bee colonies. Results from all three experiments clearly demonstrate the existence of a 'fecundity' signal that acts with QMP to suppress queen rearing.","Apis mellifera; Pheromones; Queen rearing",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031450285

This study analyzes the mechanisms controlling water collection once it has begun, that is, how a colony's water collectors know whether to continue or stop their activity. M. Lindauer suggested that water collectors acquire information about their colony's need for more water by noting how easily they can unload their water to bees inside the hive. In support of this hypothesis, we found that a water collector's ease of unloading does indeed change when her colony's need for water changes. How does a water collector sense the ease of unloading? Multiple variables of the unloading experience change in relation to a colony's water need. Three time-based variables - initial search time, total search time, and delivery time - all change quite strongly. But what changes most strongly is the number of unloading rejections (refusals by receiver bees to take the water), suggesting that this is the primary index of ease of unloading. Why does a water collector's ease of unloading change when her colony's need for water changes? Evidently, what links these two variables is change in the number of water receivers. These are middle-aged bees that receive water just inside the hive entrance, then transport it deeper inside the hive, and finally smear it on the walls of cells or give it to other bees, or both. A colony increases the number of water receivers when its water need increases by having bees engaged in nectar reception and other tasks (and possibly also bees that are not working) switch to the task of water reception. Evidently the activation of additional water receivers does not strongly reduce the number of nectar receivers in a colony, since a colony can increase greatly its water collection without simultaneously decreasing its collection of rich nectar. This study provides a clear example of the way that the members of a social insect colony can use indirect indicators of their colony's labor needs to adaptively control the work that they perform.","Apis mellifera; Colony integration; Division of labor; Temperature control; Water collection",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2642659389

The highest average concentration of 3H in bees (434 pCi mL-1) collected over the years was from LANL's Technical Area (TA) 54 - a low-level radioactive waste disposal site. Similarily, the highest average concentration of 3H in honey (709 pCi mL-1) was collected from a hive located near three 3H storage ponds at LANL TA-53. The average concentrations of 3H in bees and honey from background hives was 1.1 pCi mL-1 and 1.6 pCi mL-1, respectively. Although the concentration of 3H in bees and honey from most LANL and perimeter (WR/PA) hives were significantly higher than background, most areas, with the exception of TA-53 and TA-54, generally exhibited decreasing 3H concentrations over time. Also, all other radionuclides in honey collected from perimeter hives around LANL were not significantly different from background. Overall, the maximum total net positive CEDE-based on the average concentration plus two std dev of all the radionuclides measured over the years after the subtraction of background-from consuming 11 Ib of honey collected from LA and WR/PA, was 0.031 mrem y-1 and 0.006 mrem y-1, respectively. The highest CEDE was &lt;0.04% of the International Commission on Radiological Protection permissible dose limit of 100 mrem y-1 from all pathways and corresponds to a RECF of 1.6 x 10-8 (0.016 in a million)-far below the Environmental Protection Agency's guideline of 1 x 10-6 (one in a million).","Cesium; Food Chain; Plutonium; Strontium; Tritium; Uranium",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031148754

Since the association of the peptide in the membrane is linked with its physiological effects, a detailed understanding of the interaction of melittin with membranes is crucial. We have investigated the interaction of melittin with membranes of varying surface charge in the context of recent studies which show that the presence of negatively charged lipids in the membrane inhibits membrane lysis by melittin. The sole tryptophan residue in melittin has previously been shown to be critical for its hemolytic activity. The organization and dynamics of the tryptophan residue thus become important to understand the peptide activity in membranes of different charge types. Wavelength-selective fluorescence was utilized to monitor the tryptophan environment of membrane- bound melittin. Melittin exhibits a red edge excitation shift (REES) of 5 nm when bound to zwitterionic membranes while in negatively charged membranes, the magnitude of REES is reduced to 2-3 nm. Further, wavelength dependence of fluorescence polarization and near-UV circular dichroism spectra reveal characteristic differences in the tryptophan environment for melittin bound to zwitterionic and anionic membranes. These studies are supported by time- resolved fluorescence measurements of membrane-bound melittin. Tryptophan penetration depths for melittin bound to zwitterionic and anionic membranes were analyzed by the parallax method [Chattopadhyay, A., and London, E. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 39-45] utilizing differential fluorescence quenching obtained with phospholipids spin-labeled at two different depths.

These pheromones are transmitted among the workers both by direct contact and by deposition on and retrieval from the wax substrate of the hive. This paper presents a general model for the movement of these pheromones through a honey bee colony. The specific pheromone used for the model is produced by honey bee queens, and is thought to play a determining role in colony swarming. Thus, the results presented here are of interest to both beekeepers, for whom swarming represents the loss of a valuable resource, and bee researchers, who are interested in swarming as an example of social coordination. The model consists of a system of stochastic differential equations describing the evolution of the pheromone level and position of each bee in the hive. The equations are studied using a numerical simulation. The results of the simulations show that hive crowding can have a significant effect on pheromone transmission, and that this effect is not simply a dilution of similar quantities of pheromone among more workers. Thus, restricting worker movement induced by crowding may have a strong effect on pheromone transmission and, therefore, advance queen rearing and swarming.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031582971

In locusts, information about odour identity is contained in the timing of action potentials in an oscillatory population response(9-11), suggesting that oscillations may reflect a common reference for messages encoded in time. Although the stimulus-evoked oscillatory phenomenon is reliable, its roles in sensation, perception, memory formation and pattern recognition remain to be demonstrated a task requiring a behavioural paradigm. Using honeybees, we now demonstrate that odour encoding involves, as it does in locusts, the oscillatory synchronization of assemblies of projection neurons and that this synchronization is also selectively abolished by picrotoxin, an antagonist of the GABA(A) (γ- aminobutyric acid) receptor. By using a behavioural learning paradigm, we show that picrotoxin-induced desynchronization impairs the discrimination of molecularly similar odorants, but not that of dissimilar odorants. It appears, therefore, that oscillatory synchronization of neuronal assemblies is functionally relevant, and essential for fine sensory discrimination. This suggests that oscillatory synchronization and the kind of temporal encoding it affords provide an additional dimension by which the brain could segment spatially overlapping stimulus representations.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030666028

In this study we examined a possible benefit and a cost of the corpse-removal specialty, the improvement in performance with experience, and interference by individuals attempting to perform the same task in the same location, respectively. Experienced bees removed corpses significantly faster than less experienced bees and also were less likely to drop corpses while exiting the hive (5.5% vs. 14.3% of attempts). Superior performance by experienced undertakers might occur as a consequence of learning, or by greater ability from the outset. Because active undertakers (≤ 3 corpse removals) did not improve with experience over their own careers, learning was not demonstrated. An extreme specialist, yellow 54, removed a total of 114 corpses (33.8% of experimentally introduced dead bees) from the hive over a 13-day period. This is the longest recorded tenure of undertaking to date and demonstrates how a few individuals can dominate this task in a honey bee colony. Yellow 54 removed corpses significantly faster than other active bees, but she demonstrated no obvious improvement in performance over her undertaking career. This suggests the possibility that active undertakers were more talented than less active undertakers, irrespective of learning. When two undertakers worked together to remove a corpse from the hive, they took longer to complete the task than did single individuals. When multiple undertakers flew together from the hive, they were less likely to clear a nearby obstruction than single undertakers and were more likely to drop the corpse within 1 m of the hive. Thus, mutual interference exacted a measurable cost as a result of the undertaking specialization while learning provided few benefits.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030699542

The labelled peptide was characterised functionally in cytolytic assays, and spectroscopically by circular dichroism and fluorescence.

Improvements in associative learning performance coincide temporally with increases in glomerular volume.

When the leg is accelerated, inertia causes the haemolymph (and the subgenual organ) to lag behind the movement of the rest of the leg. The magnitude of this phase lag determines the displacement of the subgenual organ relative to the leg and to the proximal end of the organ, which is connected to the cuticle. Oscillations of the subgenual organ are visualised during vibration stimulation of the leg, by means of stroboscopic light. Video analysis provides fairly accurate values of the amplitude and phase of the oscillations, which are compared with the predictions of a model. The model comparison shows that the haemolymph channel can be described as an oscillating fluid-filled tube occluded by an elastic structure (probably the subgenual organ). The mechanical properties of the subgenual organ and haemolymph channel resemble those of an overdamped mass-spring system. A comparison of the threshold curve of the subgenual organ determined using electrophysiology with that predicted by the oscillating tube model suggests that the sensory cells respond to displacements of the organ relative to the leg.","Honeybee; Mechanical model; Stimulus transduction; Subgenual organ; Vibration sense",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030817178

In our experiments the animals were able to scan an object for several minutes with the antennae. After moving the object out of the range of the antennae, the animals showed antennal movements for several minutes that were correlated with the position of the removed object. These changes of antennal movements are called 'behavioural plasticity' and are interpreted as a form of motor learning. Bees showed behavioural plasticity only for objects with relatively large surfaces. Plasticity was more pronounced in bees whose compound eyes were occluded. Behavioural plasticity was related to the duration of object presentation. Repeated presentations of the object increased the degree of plasticity. After presentation durations of 30 min the animals showed a significant increase of antennal positions related to the surface of the object and avoidance of areas corresponding to the edges. Behavioural plasticity was compared with reward-dependent learning by conditioning bees to objects. The results of motor learning and reward-dependent conditioning suggest that bees have tactile spatial memory.","Antennal system; Honeybee; Insect brain; Motor learning; Tactile learning",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030823504

Age-related fluctuations in binding levels were markedly different for these two ligands. 3H-SCH-23390 and 3H-spiperone binding sites were present at low levels during metamorphic adult development. After adult emergence, however, 3H-SCH23390 binding levels, in contrast to those of 3H-spiperone, increased significantly. Within the first 48 h of adult life 3H-SCH-23390 binding reached a level not significantly different from that detected in forager bees. No significant fluctuations in the levels of 3H-spiperone binding were observed during the adult lifetime of the bee. Measurements of dopamine levels in the brains of pupal and adult bees revealed no direct correlation between fluctuations in endogenous amine levels and the amount of binding of either 3H-SCH-23390 or 3H-spiperone. These results provide evidence for subtype-specific patterns of expression of dopamine receptors in the insect brain and show that D1- and D2-like receptors are expressed not only in the adult CNS, but also in the developing brain of the bee.","Age-related; Dopamine; Insect; SCH-23390; Spiperone",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030874957

Eggs, prepupae, pupae, and worker bees emerging from cells as adults are usually free of internal microbes. Microorganisms acquired by larvae through ingestion of contaminated food are usually eliminated through the single defecation that occurs at the end of the feeding period prior to pupation. Emerging adult bees acquire intestinal microflora by food exchange with other bees in the colony and through consumption of pollen. Biochemical contributions of microorganisms to honey bees; the role of microorganisms in the conversion, enhancement, and preservation of pollen stored as bee bread in comb cells; and the production of antimycotic substances by molds and Bacillus spp. from honey bee colonies that are resistant to the fungal disease, chalkbrood, are discussed. An association of Bacillus spp. with bees including honey bees, stingless bees, and solitary bees from tropical and temperate zones appears to have evolved in which female bees inoculate food sources with these bacteria whose chemical products contribute to the elaboration and/or protection from spoilage of food that is stored in the nest. This association is ancient based on results from stingless bees preserved in amber for 25-40 million years. It is concluded that bees, their products, and their associated microorganisms are potential sources of bioactive products including antimicrobial compounds.","Bacillus spp.; Gram-variable pleomorphic bacteria; Honey bee; Mold; Pollen; Yeast",Short Survey,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031461587

Then the head is cut free and placed into a dye-loaded and cooled ringer solution in a staining chamber for 1 h. Subsequently, the head is fixed in a recording chamber, covered with a cover-slip, and imaged under the microscope with a cooled CCD camera. The whole preparation leaves the antennae dry, free to move, and functional throughout the experiment, allowing for natural odour stimulation of the olfactory system.

The results of the experiments indicate that the bees discriminate the disruption of the pattern as a whole, irrespective of the actual pattern. Bees trained to prefer a larger period transfer to an even larger period, when given a forced choice with a pair of patterns of differing disruption from those they were trained on, as if their spontaneous preference has not been overcome. Bees trained to prefer a smaller period, however, prefer the former negative pattern rather than transfer to an even smaller period. These results show that the bees do not rely solely on learning the absolute period of a pattern nor the relative disruption of two patterns, and they are confused when these two cues conflict in tests with unfamiliar targets.

We examined behavioral repertoires, behavioral correlates of adult development, and spatial distributions within the hive to explore the mechanisms that produce behavioral variation among middle-age honey bees (Apis mellifera). Individually labeled undertakers, guards, food storers, and wax workers exhibited a broad range of task-related behavior, but bees tagged as undertakers were more likely to subsequently remove a corpse from the hive and handle a corpse compared to other middle-aged bees. The activity level of undertakers was similar to other task groups, suggesting that undertaking specialists were neither hyper-active 'elites' nor quiescent 'reserves' that become active only when a dead bee stimulus is present. Undertakers also were more likely to remove debris and to remain in the lower region of the hive or near the entrance, even when not engaged in corpse removal; both preferences may promote colony efficiency by reducing inter-task travel times. Guards and undertakers were less likely to perform behavior normally associated with young bees compared to food storers and wax workers. Undertakers and guards also initiated foraging at earlier ages than the other task groups. These results suggest that undertakers and guards may be slightly developmentally advanced compared to food storers and wax workers. There also was evidence for lifetime differences in behavioral preferences which could not be explained by differences in adult development. Bees tagged as undertakers were more likely to subsequently remove a dead bee during their entire pre-foraging career compared to other task groups or members of their general age cohort. Differences in both the rate of adult development and individual behavioral preferences, both of which may be subject to genetic and environmental influences, are important determinants of inter-individual variation among honey bees of middle age.","Apis mellifera; Division of labor; Ergonomics; Honey bees; Hygienic behaviour; Social insects",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030827356

Populations of the most important pollinator of the crop, the honey bee, Apis mellifera L. continue to decrease in North America, thus there is a need to evaluate alternate pollinators so that seed growers can optimize their choice of pollinator. Treatments consisted of plants caged to exclude all pollinators, plants caged with leaf cutter bees, and plants exposed to resident pollinators including alfalfa leafcutter bees. These vetches were self-sterile and produced very little seed when bees were excluded. Pods and seeds per raceme, seeds per pod, percentage seed set and yield were significantly higher for plants of both species exposed to resident pollinators compared to plants caged with leafcutter bees. Significant differences between the two treatments indicate that the alfalfa leafcutter bee would not serve as an effective pollinator for these vetches. However, if insufficient populations of honey bees or resident native bees exist in an area, only then may leafcutter bees have a place in commercial seed production. Several species of bumble bee were the main pollinator of these crops in Alberta, Canada.

Permanent low oxygen levels around 15% were found in its core. This hypoxia was actively controlled, probably via indirect mechanisms. Varying ambient oxygen levels demonstrated a causal relationship between lowered oxygen and reduced metabolic rate (MR). Under deeper ambient hypoxia the bees switched to ultra low MR (ULMR), optional-occasional at 15% oxygen, obligatory at 7.5% oxygen. This dormancy status resembled deep diapause in insects. It stayed reversible after at least several days, and was terminated under normal oxygen at 15°C. Reduced MR via core-hypoxia is essential in water conserving thermoregulation of the wintering cluster. It allows bees to reconcile warm wintering in alert state-for defence of stores-with energy saving and longevity. Two further hypotheses discussed are that winter MR of bees might be related to insect diapause, and that in-body hypoxia might be functional in insect diapause.","Apis mellifera; Carbon dioxide; Diapause; Dormancy; Hibernation; Honey bee; Hypoxia; Metabolic rate; Metabolism; Oxygen; Thermoregulation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031214189

Their impact on Australian ecosystems is difficult to assess, but may include competition with native fauna for floral resources or nesting sites, or inadequate or inappropriate pollination of native flora. In this 3-year study we examined the demography of the feral bee population in the riparian woodland of Wyperfeld National Park in north-west Victoria. The population is very large but varied considerably in size (50-150 colonies/km2) during the study period (1992-1995). The expected colony lifespan for an established colony is 6.6 years, that for a founder colony (new swarm), 2.7 years. The population is expected to be stable if each colony produces 0.75 swarms per year, which is less than the number predicted on the basis of other studies (2-3 swarms/colony per year). Therefore, the population has considerable capacity for increase. Most colony deaths occurred in the summer, possibly due to high temperatures and lack of water. Colonies showed considerable spatial aggregation, agreeing with earlier findings. When all colonies were eradicated from two 5-ha sites, the average rate of re-occupation was 15 colonies/km2 per year. Ten swarms of commercial origin were released and were found to have similar survival rates to founder colonies. However, the feral population is self-sustaining, and does not require immigration from the domestic population.","Demography; Honey bee; Population dynamics; Reproductive rate; Swarming",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030740283

The method is an application of Procrustes analysis, which computes best-fitting super-positions of configurations of landmarks to the left and right sides of a single specimen. The Procrustes method combines subtle deviations in all aspects of the landmark configuration into one net asymmetry score. Directional asymmetry is separated from fluctuating asymmetry in a simple partition of a net sum-of-squares, and geometrical details of either component can be inspected by traditional methods of multivariate statistical analysis of landmarks. We demonstrate this method in a comparison of wing venation asymmetry in male (haploid) and female (diploid) honey bees (Apis mellifera). In addition we investigate the effects of ploidy and inter-subspecies hybridization on asymmetry and wing venation abnormalities, using the subspecies A. m. mellifera, A. m. carnica, and the hybrid strain 'Nigra'. Results suggest that while the haploid males showed a higher frequency of wing venation abnormalities and greater total asymmetry than the diploid females, most of the asymmetry difference between males and females was in the form of directional, not fluctuating, asymmetry. Hybrid females had a higher frequency of wing venation abnormalities than females of either subspecies, but there were no significant differences in the mean level of asymmetry among females of A. m. mellifera, A. m. carnica and hybrid Nigra.","Allozymes; Apis mellifera; Fluctuating asymmetry; MtDNA; Procrustes methods",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030614009

Blocking therefore represents a tactic that animals can use to modulate associative learning in order to focus on the most predictive stimuli at the expense of novel ones. Using an olfactory blocking paradigm in the honeybee, we investigated the mechanistic basis for olfactory blocking. We show that removing input from one antenna eliminates the blocking of one odor by another. Since antennal sensory neurons only project to the ipsilateral antennal lobe in the honeybee, more central processing regions of the brain than the antennae must be crucial for establishing blocking. Further experiments show that this bilateral interaction between brain hemispheres is crucial during both the induction and the expression of blocking. This result implies that blocking involves an active inhibition of odor association and recall, and that this inhibition is mediated by a structure that spans both brain hemispheres. This interpretation is consistent with a role for identified bilateral modulatory neurons in the production of blocking.","Apis mellifera; Blocking; Honeybee; Learning; Memory; Odor mixtures; Olfactory conditioning",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031193578

While the visual neuropiles, the antennal lobes, and structures of the central brain exhibit intermediate immunostaining, the mushroom bodies show high labeling and contain a three- to fourfold higher PKA activity compared to other neuropiles. Since the mushroom bodies are central sites of olfactory learning mediated via cAMP- dependent signaling, the modulatory functions of transmitters on PKA activity in Kenyon cells from the honeybee were tested. Agents which elevate cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels have no effects on PKA activity in cultured Kenyon cells. Dopamine, serotonin, and octopamine, however, cause an increase in PKA activity in Kenyon cells. The modulation of PKA activity by octopamine, the putative transmitter of the unconditioned stimulus in associative olfactory learning in the honeybee, together with the findings on the central role of the cAMP cascade in Drosophila mushroom bodies, suggests a major implication of PKAII-mediated phosphorylation in learning and memory in both Drosophila and Apis.","Kenyon cells; Learning; Memory; Mushroom body; PKA",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1842335692

To identify different glutamate receptor subclasses, the following agonists and antagonists of L-glutamate were used: N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), kainic acid, quick-salic acid, D-glutamylaminomethylphosphonic acid (GAMP), 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dion (DNQX), D-glutamylaminosulphonic acid (GAMS), and a potentiating factor, glycine.

The percentage of antennal lobe neurons in vitro expressing spiperone binding sites increased significantly with the development of the antennal lobe neuropil. Fluorescently labelled spiperone (120 nM) could be displaced effectively by 1 mM dopamine but not by the same concentration of tyramine, octopamine, or serotonin. In addition, the D2 antagonist spiperone and the D2/D1 antagonist fluphenazine were more effective at displacing the fluorescent ligand than the D1-specific antagonist SCH23390.

Flux capacities are in large excess over physiological flux rates in low-flux muscles, resulting in low fractional velocities (%V(max) = v/V(max) x 100) in vivo. In high-flux muscles, close matches between flux capacities and flux rates (resulting in fractional velocities approaching 100% in vivo) are observed.

We made optical recordings in vivo in the honeybee brain to investigate neuronal population responses to odorants delivered naturally to the animal. We report here that odours evoked specific spatio-temporal excitation patterns in the antennal lobe, the structural and functional analogue of the olfactory bulb. Specific ensembles of active glomeruli represent odours in a combinatorial manner. A comparison between different individuals shows remarkable similarities for a pheromone component, but not for general flower odours. Mixtures evoked patterns that were combinations of the single odorant responses. These combinations were not fully additive, however, indicating inhibitory effects on single glomeruli.

H., Kirby, M. S., Lederer, W. J., and Coronado, R. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 12185-12189). A cDNA library was prepared from the venomous glands of this scorpion and used to clone the gene encoding IpTx(1). From a single continuous messenger RNA, the information coding for the toxin is translated into two mature polypeptide subunits after elimination of a basic pentapeptide. The IpTx(i) dimer consists of a large subunit (104-amino acid residues) with phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity covalently linked by a disulfide bond to a smaller (27 amino acid residues), structurally unrelated subunit. Thus, IpTx(i) is a heterodimeric protein with lipolytic action, a property that is only shared with β-bungarotoxins, a group of neurotoxins from snake venoms. The enzymatic subunit of IpTx(i) is highly homologous to PLA2 from bee (Apis mellifera) and lizard (Heloderma horridum) venoms. The small subunit has no significant similarity to any other known peptide, including members of the Kunitz protease inhibitors superfamily that target the lipolytic effect of β-bungarotoxins. A synthetic peptide with amino acid sequence identical to that of the small subunit failed to inhibit RyR. On the other hand, treatment of IpTx(i) with p-bromophenacyl-bromide, a specific inhibitor of PLA2 activity, greatly reduced the capacity of IpTx(i) to inhibit RyRs. These results suggested that a lipid product of PLA2 activity, more than a direct IpTx(i)-RyR interaction, was responsible for RyR inhibition.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030946126

A 51-residue insect defensin was characterized which, like the Apis mellifera defensins, had a highly conserved 12-residue extension to its C-terminal compared to defensins from other insects. Monoisotopic mass analysis of the C-terminal of B. pascuorum defensin confirmed that this molecule was C-terminally amidated. This defensin showed strong anti-Gram-positive activity and some anti-fungal activity; also, in contrast to other insect defensins, it showed anti-Gram- negative activity. A 17-residue apidaecin was characterized, showing anti- Gram-negative activity, and differing by a single amino acid substitution from the A. mellifera apidaecin. A 39-residue abaecin was isolated, the largest proline-rich antimicrobial peptide characterized to date, which showed activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Finally, we isolated an N-terminally blocked molecule, with a molecular mass of 10,122 Da, which showed activity against Gram-negative bacteria only. These characteristics are reminiscent of hymenoptaecin from the honeybee A. mellifera, but a definitive characterization of this molecule awaits further work. No evidence of lysozyme activity was found in the haemolymph of challenged or naive B. pascuorum.","Apidaecin Abaecin; Bombus; Hymenoptaecin; Insect defensin; Insect immunity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031149265

Comparisons were based on percent fruit abortion as influenced by bee type and the number of bee visits to treatment flowers. For both crops, bee visit number was significant. As the number of bee visits to flowers increased, the number of fruits aborted decreased. With cucumbers, B. impatiens-visited flowers consistently had a lower percent abortion than A. mellifera when compared at equal bee visit numbers. This difference between bee types was highly significant. Differences were not detected between bee types in the watermelon study except at low visitation levels (i.e. single bee visit to flower). However, abortion rates for bumble bee-visited flowers were consistently less or equal to those for honey bees at equal bee visit numbers for both crops. There was 100 percent abortion for flowers receiving no entomophilous visitation, and significant abortion rates by flowers receiving low bee visit numbers, emphasizing the need for active transfer of pollen in these crops by insect pollinators. In light of decreased honey bee populations due to mite pests and the Africanized honey bee, we conclude that bumble bees could serve as a back-up or alternate pollinator for honey bees for cucumber and watermelon and possibly other vine crops grown in either greenhouse or field environments.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001123237

The primary swarm leaves the nest with the mated mother queen. Further 'after-swarms' can leave the nest. These are composed of virgin queens and sister workers. Since all workers in the primary swarm have the same relationship to the mother queen, kin recognition cannot have any effect on the worker distribution in the swarm. Because of polyandry of the mother queen, the after-swarm is composed of superand halfsister workers of the virgin queen. In this case kin recognition might affect swarm composition if workers increase their inclusive fitness by preferentially investing in a supersister queen. The distribution of workers in the mother colony, the primary and the afterswarm was analyzed using single-locus DNA fingerprinting in two colonies of the honeybee (Apis mellifera). The colonies were composed of 21 and 24 worker subfamilies because of multiple mating of the queen. The subfamily distribution in the mother colonies before swarming was significantly different from the subfamily frequencies in the primary swarm. This indicates different propensities for swarming in the various subfamilies. The subfamily distribution was also significantly different between the mother colony and the after-swarm. There was however no significant difference between the subfamily composition of the primary and the afterswarm. The average effects of kin recognition on the distribution of the subfamilies in the two after-swarms were less than 2%.

However, data on reproduction in colonies of its original host, A. cerana Fabricius, are still fragmentary. In order to compare reproductive success in naturally infested brood cells of A. cerana and A. mellifera, freshly capped worker and drone cells (0-5 h after capping) were marked and opened 9 days later. When one or more foundress Varroa mites were found, the number and stage of the offspring were recorded. In colonies of A. cerana, V. jacobsoni reproduced almost exclusively in drone cells. Surprisingly, however, these drone cells proved to be better suited for reproduction than drone (and worker) cells of A. mellifera. Firstly, in drone cells of A. cerana, 97-100% of the mites produced daughters and 98-99% of these mites also produced a son. In drone and worker cells of A. mellifera only 70-80% produced daughters and only 74-86% of these mites produced a son. Secondly, if a mite produced daughters, she produced more daughters in drone cells of A. cerana than in drone cells of A. mellifera: 4.5-4.6 vs 2.9-3.7 daughters per mite, respectively. Finally, infestation by two founders females negatively affected reproduction per mite in drone cells of A. mellifera, but not in drone cells of A. cerana. Thus, V. jacobsoni seems to be better adapted to A. cerana than to A. mellifera, although population growth to mites in A. mellifera colonies is higher due to the exploitation of worker cells besides drone cells.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030854912

To discriminate between two orientations, the bees must possess more than one orientation-sensitive neuron type. Therefore, the aim is to search for different types of orientation-sensitive cells of the honey bee, and measure their receptive field, velocity sensitivity and contrast sensitivity. Orientation-sensitive cells with two different types of orientation tuning-curves were recorded intracellularly in the mid-brain of the honey bee when the stimulus was a narrow bar (bar width = 5°). These cells are sensitive to bar movement within their large receptive field, which covers the visual field of one eye. They are quite distinct from the well-known directional motion detectors. The contrast sensitivity of the orientation-sensitive cells recorded in this study corresponds to results from behavioural experiments. The velocity-sensitivity curves of the orientation-sensitive cells differ from those of the direction-sensitive cells. Measurements of orientation sensitivity and contrast sensitivity when the stimulus is a wide bar (bar width =10°), done in different eye regions, suggest that each orientation-sensitive cell receives visual signals from an array of orientational subunits within its receptive field.

In contrast, phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), which catalyzes a reaction believed to be close to equilibrium, occurs at V(max) values greatly in excess of glycolytic flux rates. In this study, we measure the V(max) of flight muscle PGI, the kinetic parameters of the purified enzyme, the apparent equilibrium constants for the reaction and the tissue concentrations of substrate and product. Using the Haldane equation, we estimate that the forward flux capacity (V(f)) for PGI required to achieve physiological glycolytic flux rates is between 800 and 1070 units ml-1 cell water, approximately 45-60% of the empirically measured V(max) of 1770 units ml-1 cell water at optimal pH (8.0) and low ionic strength (no added KCl). When measured at physiological pH (7.0) and ionic strength (120 mmol l-1 KCl) with saturating levels of substrate, PGI activity is 1130 units ml-1 cell water, a value close to the calculated V(f).

The sPLA2 found in honey bee venom is neurotoxic and binds to this receptor with high affinity. In this paper, we have used a number of mutants of bee venom sPLA2 produced in Escherichia coli to determine the structural elements of this protein that are involved in its binding to N-type receptors. Mutations in the interfacial binding surface, in the Ca2+-binding loop and in the hydrophobic channel lead to a dramatic decrease in binding to N-type receptors, whereas mutations of surface residues localized in other parts of the sPLA2 structure do not significantly modify the binding properties. Neurotoxicity experiments show that mutants with low affinity for N-type receptors are devoid of neurotoxic properties, even though some of them retain high enzymatic activity. These results provide further evidence for the involvement of N-type receptors in neurotoxic processes associated with venom sPLA2s and identify the surface region surrounding the hydrophobic channel of bee venom sPLA2 as the N-type receptor recognition domain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031002464

In subsequent tests they were given a choice between the trained disc and an alternative disc that differed either in its chromatic properties, or in the amount of achromatic green contrast that it produced against the background. Tests were conducted in two experimental situations: one in which discs subtended a visual angle of 30°(as viewed by the bee at the decision point in the Y-maze), and another in which the angle was 6.5°or 5°(depending on the experiment). At the visual angle of 30°, the bees' choice behaviour was governed by the differences in chromatic properties, and not by the differences in the amount of green contrast. With the 6.5°- and 5°-discs, on the other band, it was governed by the differences in the amount of green contrast, and not by the differences in chromatic properties. Consequently, in the present discrimination task, bees use either chromatic or achromatic cues, depending on the visual angle subtended by the stimuli at the eye.

Maximum content was 0.23 mg for workers (28 d), and 0.59 mg for drones (after emergence). Workers have relatively constant glycogen contents during their life, and very young drones have more glycogen than older ones. Young queens are similar to workers. In workers and queens in summer the greatest amounts of glycogen are found in the thorax. When the bees start flying (6th-8th day of life), drones have the highest amounts in the head (probably to supply their eyes), and upon maturity, drones have the least glycogen in the abdomen. Workers in winter show different glycogen values depending on whether they are active bees from the core area (0.23 mg) or inactive ones from the outer surface of the winter cluster (0.37 mg).

These two processes of host envenomation appeared to be independent and complementary in primary parasitism or in hyperparasitism of a distantly related hymenopteran host species. In contrast, the development of larvae as hyperparasites on members of their own species or genus depended completely on the prior injection of female venom. The venoms of the female and the first instar larva had similar effects on the cellular metabolism of the primary hosts. Protein synthesis was blocked in C. maculatus hosts envenomated by a female or a first instar larva of E. orientalis, but the absence of DNA breakdown indicated that these paralysed hosts were alive and quiescent. The venomous secretions injected by adult females and first instar larvae of E. orientalis had distinct electrophoretic profiles. The immunoreactive features of proteins from female venom and larval secretions were also examined. There is evidence for antigenic conservation between some venom proteins of E. orientalis and Apis mellifera. Lastly, the hyaluronidase, phospholipase and lipase activities in the female Venom gland and in larval-derived secretions of E. orientalis were assayed. No lipase activity was detected. Phospholipase activity was found in both the female venom and the larval secretions of E. orientalis, whereas hyaluronidase was specific to the female venom.","Ectoparasitoid; Enzymatic activities; Female venom; Host physiology; Larval salivary secretion; Protein profiles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030848062

We studied the effects of odorant concentration on classical conditioning involving odorants and odorant-mechanosensory compounds using the proboscis-extension reflex in the honeybee. Our results show that high concentrations of odorant (a) support better discrimination in a feature-positive task using rewarded odorant-mechanosensory compounds versus unrewarded mechanosensory stimuli, (b) have a stronger capacity to overshadow learning of a simultaneously trained mechanosensory stimulus, and (c) induce better memory consolidation. Furthermore, honeybees were trained discriminatively to two different concentrations of one odorant. Honeybees are not able to solve this task when presented with rewarded low versus unrewarded high concentrations. Taken together, our results suggest that high concentrations of odorant support stronger associations (are more 'salient') than low concentrations. Our results, however, do not indicate that honeybees can treat two different concentrations of one odorant as qualitatively different stimuli. These findings fill a gap in what is known about honeybee olfactory learning and are a first step in relating behaviour to recent advances in the physiological analysis of coding for odorant concentration in honeybees.","Apis mellifera carnica; honeybee; learning; mechanoreception; memory; olfaction; Pavlovian conditioning; salience; stimulus intensity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031080454

Specific immunolabeling of the photoreceptors has been found in the compound eyes and ocelli of both examined species. Intense immunostaining can be also detected in the midbrain of these species. The axons of immunoreactive cells innervate almost every area in the protocerebrum. Most of the reactive neurons are typically wide-field neurons with bilateral ramifications that form dense arborizations. Numerous small buttons on the arborizations probably represent pre- and postsynaptic sites. The histamine-like immunoreactive neurons are apparently connected to many postsynaptic neurons. In both bees and crickets, some regions of the nervous system such as the first two optic neuropils and the central body show the same labeling pattern, whereas the mushroom bodies exhibit no immunoreactivity. Nevertheless, several differences in the staining pattern can be seen: the glomeruli of the antennal lobe are invaded by histamine-like immunoreactive fibers in the bee but not in the cricket. Furthermore, an interneuron connects the second and third optic neuropil in the cricket, whereas no histamine-like immunoreactive interneuron is found in the second optic neuropil in the bee. In accord with the work of other authors on the distribution histamine in the insect nervous system, we suggest that histamine is not only a transmitter within the visual system, but also a transmitter or cotransmitter in the insect midbrain.","Apis mellifera (Insecta); Fluorescent dyes; Gryllus campestris (Insecta); Immunocytochemistry; Insect brain; Neurotransmitters; Photoreceptor cells",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031024110

CAST results were not influenced by the severity of the allergic reaction nor by the time lapse since the sting had occurred. In conclusion, CAST is a valuable test in insect sting allergy. However, established methods such as skin tests and RAST-CAP achieve better results. CAST should therefore be considered a supplementary method in cases where established methods fail. It remains to be shown whether CAST can be used as a parameter for monitoring patients who have undergone immunotherapy.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031022008

Mitochondrial DNA and behavioral characteristics support a closer relationship of A m ruttneri to A m intermissa of North Africa than to European subspecies, similar to the situation with endemic island honey bees of Sicily (A m sicula). These findings suggest a shared evolutionary history among bees populating the islands of the central Mediterranean region. Recent importations of non-active honey bee subspecies present a clear threat to conservation of this unique honey bee of limited distribution. The subspecies is named after Professor Friedrich Ruttner, who has contributed so much to the understanding of intra-specific taxonomy in the honey bee.","Apis mellifera ruffneri; Evolution; Malta; Subspecies; Taxonomy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031434993

Swarming and supersedure occur in different seasons but with similar frequencies. Swarming is correlated with an influx of pollen and increased drone production; supersedure with declining pollen availability and decreased brood production. Neither swarming nor supersedure can be predicted by prior queen replacement events in a colony. Whether a virgin queen is the product of either a swarm or supersedure colony, probability favours matings with drones of swarm queen origin in both swarming and supersedure seasons. Because of frequency differences in the timing of swarming and supersedure there are more swarming than supersedure events on a yearly basis.

The analysis of genomic structure reveals seven introns in the coding region of the gene, with six at novel positions for an insect opsin gene. The equivalent site to the counterion in vertebrate opsins is occupied by a Tyr residue. This contrasts with the presence of Phe at this site in the ultraviolet-sensitive opsins of Drosophila sps. A comparison of the amino acid sequence within the seven a-helical transmembrane regions of insect ultraviolet/blue-sensitive opsins identifies substitution at five sites that involve either replacement of a polar with a non-polar residue, or a change in charge. Such changes an known to result in spectral shifts in vertebrate pigments.

Female C tarsata carried twice as much pollen as A mellifera foragers. It is shown that cashew pollen was selectively distributed on a pollinator's body and that it had little mobility on the bodies of the bees, tending to remain on the body parts upon which it was initially deposited. Areas of the body of the bee which had greater densities of cashew pollen had also touched cashew stigmas, supporting suggestions that A. mellifera and C. tarsata are effective cashew pollinators.

Coupled gas chromatography (GC)-CPE analysis of the air entrainment samples was used to locate key compounds involved in the recognition of B. napus flowers, and the compounds were then identified using coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and comparison with authentic samples. Six legions of the gas chromatograms elicited CPE responses from bees previously conditioned to the total extract, and from these areas 16 compounds were identified that elicited CPE activity from conditioned bees when tested with synthetic samples. Eight of the 16, α-pinene, phenylacetaldehyde, p-cymene. α-terpinene, linalool, 2-phenyl-ethanol, (E,E)-α-famesene, and 3-carene, gave the highest responses. When the bees were conditioned to the total extract of flower volatiles, a mixture of the eight components elicited responses from 83% of the individuals, suggesting that the eight-component mixture accounted for a major part of the CPE activity of the total extract. In addition, a mixture of the three most active compounds, phenylacetaldehyde, linalool, and (E,E,)-α-famesene, evoked responses from 85% of the bees after the latter had been conditioned to the eight-component mixture. Thus, these three compounds appear to play a key role in the recognition of the eight component mixture and, by inference, of oilseed rape flowers.","Apidae; Apis mellifera; Brassica napus; Conditioned proboscis extension; Flower volatiles; Honeybee; Hymenoptera; Oilseed rape; Olfactory recognition",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030834329

The majority of mites were found between the 3rd and 4th ventro-lateral tergites of the abdomen with a significant preference for the left side of the host. This position would enable the mites to place their mouthparts in close proximity to the central portion of the bees' ventriculus. This may allow the mites access to nutrients at higher concentrations than would occur elsewhere in the haemolymph. At the start of winter, most infested bees carried only a single mite but towards the end increasing numbers of bees carried 2 or more mites. There was also an increase in the mite: bee ratio and more mobile mites (i.e. those moving about on the bees) were recorded. These results suggest that the mites suffer a lower overwinter mortality than the bees and are capable of transferring to a new host either before the original host dies or before it falls to the floor of the hive.

By making feasible long-term storage of ooplasm biopsied from preblastoderm embryos, the method could become a key element for the development of an efficient and practical procedure for cloning and other genetic studies of honeybees. Donor ooplasm to be cryopreserved was extracted from the anterior pole of 8.0- to 9.0-h preblastoderm embryos with a transplantation pipet. The anterior end of the pipet was plugged with a small ball of cotton fiber, before it was fastened with a tape to a fine iron wire and plunged into liquid nitrogen. After being stored in liquid nitrogen for at least 24 h, the pipet was thawed rapidly in a water bath at 25°C. The ooplasm was injected at the anterior pole of recipient embryos (0.5 to 3.5 h) at room temperature and at a relative humidity >70%.

The number of reproductive cycles, i.e. the number of times a mite enters brood cells to reproduce, has been suggested to be the key to this problem. Despite several studies on this aspect, large discrepancies in the published data remain. This paper describes a new experimental method for studying this aspect of the mites' biology in order to resolve this question. Colonies containing only worker bee brood were manipulated so they had discrete brood cycles. Colonies were kept in a mite-free area and infested with a known number of mites at the start of the study. To estimate the average number of reproductive cycles performed, the observed growth in the mite populations was compared with the theoretical growth of mite populations which performed different numbers of reproductive cycles, but with conditions otherwise similar to those observed in the study colonies. The level of mite drop was used as an indicator of the mite population. The average potential number of reproductive cycles required to explain the observed mite population growth was between two and three. © 1997 International Bee Research Association.","Apis mellifera; Honey bees; Mite drop; Mite populations; Reproductive cycles; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031373040

The time-activity budget of both infesting and developing mites converged toward a stable pattern which was established during the bee prepupal stage of the infesting mites and the protonymphal stage of mite progeny. The pattern was such that infesting females and offspring eventually divided their activity between the fecal accumulation on the cell wall, which served as the rendezvous site for newly molted individuals, and the feeding site prepared on the pupa by the foundress. Other parts of the cell wall were used for oviposition and molting, away from the fecal accumulation on which activity of mobile stages was concentrated. Space structuring and the time-activity budget in Varroa probably evolved to enhance the number of fertilized females produced within the capped brood, where space and time are limiting factors.

The relationship between the amount of capped drone brood to capped worker brood in a colony was similar for the two bee types, suggesting that similar factors influenced drone brood production in AHB and EHB colonies. The differences between bee types in their schedules of wax comb construction were less clear, though EHB colonies constructed a greater total amount of comb, and AHB colonies constructed more drone comb. AHB colonies built up faster than EHB colonies, and AHB colonies invested less in colony maintenance (comb construction) than EHB colonies in Yucatan. Our results contradict other comparative studies of AHB and EHB colonies as we found that the differences between bee types in their total annual production of drones and workers were slight or non-existent, possibly reflecting the unlimited cavity volumes offered to both bee types in our study, or the local provenance of the EHB colonies. These results suggest that AHB colonies may prove useful in commercial and rural small-scale beekeeping operations in the neotropics when they are given unlimited cavity volumes in which to expand their brood nest as their survival and propensity to swarm may then be similar to those of EHB. However, we did not measure the honey production of colonies and any potential advantages of using AHB in beekeeping operations will have to be weighed against the disadvantages imposed by the greater defensiveness of AHB and their more rapid colony development which demand more frequent colony inspections. © 1997 International Bee Research Association.","Africanized honey bees; Apis mellifera; Colony development; Comb production; Drone brood; Honey bees; Mexico; Worker brood",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031510330

Proboscis extension conditioning (PEC) and electroantennogram (EAG) assays were used to investigate stimulus-intensity dynamics during olfactory processing in the honey bee. Experiments that tested generalization involved conditioning to one odorant concentration and either testing with a different odorant or with different concentrations of the same odorant. At low training concentrations, responses to either a novel odorant or to higher concentrations of the same odorant resulted in strong generalization. At higher training concentrations, significantly less generalization was observed to a novel odorant or to lower concentrations of the same odor. EAG analyses indicate that asymmetric generalization could arise due to long-term adaptation of peripheral receptor neurons. Discrimination experiments showed that relatively higher odorant concentrations associated with an appetitive reinforcer could usually be discriminated from a lower concentration that was associated with punishment, but not vice versa. Although sensory modulation in peripheral (sensory) processes might be sufficient to account for discrimination of a high from a low concentration, discrimination of low from high concentrations point to the involvement of central processes.","Discrimination; Electroantennogram; Honey bee; Olfaction; Proboscis extension conditioning; Sensory adaptation; Stimulus generalization",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031031261

Primary and secondary EVE stripes form in roughly anterior-to-posterior succession; there are 8 primary and 16 secondary stripes. The most posterior primary stripes appear only after the onset of gastrulation. The secondary stripes form by a splitting of primary stripes; they demarcate the parasegmental pattern. While these findings resemble EVE expression in long-germ beetles, the honeybee differs from both beetles and dipterans by two transient pair-rule traits in the parasegmental EVE pattern: the secondary stripes in head and thorax alternate in strength, yet out of register with the Drosophila pattern, and over the whole pattern the odd-numbered stripes vanish earlier than their even-numbered counterparts. As in Drosophila, however, the strong EVE stripes coincide with the weak engrailed (EN) stripes. These findings are taken to indicate that (1) honeybee and beetles share a conserved mode of EVE stripe formation whilst Drosophila has diverged in this respect, (2) honeybee and Drosophila have diverged from the beetles in specific pair-rule traits during the parasegmental expression of both EVE and EN, and (3) some of these traits differ in the register of segment pairing and thus may reflect regulatory divergences at the pair-rule level between dipterans and the honeybee. © Springer-Verlag 1997.","Alternating stripe intensities; Apis mellifera; Even-skipped; Frame of pair-rule patterning; Long-germ segmentation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001027005

Reliable acquisition and retention of the learning was not achieved until bees were 6 days of age. With comparable learning and memory to mature forager bees only at day 10. In a second study, bees from the same colonies were reared in a full hive colony, and a much slower development of this behaviour was seen. The results suggest that the behavioural role of the bee in the hive colony is as important as brain maturation for olfactory learning. This was explored further by producing precocious learning abilities in young (3-day-old) bees by preventing their normal nurse bee activities. The results are discussed in terms of the anatomical maturation of the bee nervous system and behavioural demands on the olfactory system throughout adult development.","age; Apis mellifera; olfactory learning; proboscis extension reflex",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030991458

Light and electron microscopic examination of tissue indicated that both melittin (4 μg/g) and bee venom PLA2 (4 μg/g) caused necrosis of skeletal muscle cells within 30 min after i.m. injection. Early changes in the cells consisted of delta lesions, indicating a ruptured plasma membrane, and hypercontraction of myofibrils. By 24 hr the affected cells appeared as an amorphous mass of disorganized and disrupted myofibrils contained in an intact basal lamina. To ensure that the myotoxic activity of the melittin preparation was not due to contaminating PLA2 activity, the preparation was treated with p-bromophenacyl bromide (p-BPB), a known inhibitor of PLA2 activity. The p-BPB-treated melittin was determined to have no detectable PLA2 activity using a sensitive muscle cell culture assay, and it still induced myonecrosis, although to a lesser extent and of a slower onset. Additionally, p-BPB treatment of purified bee venom PLA2 completely inhibited its myotoxic activity. These results indicate that both melittin and bee venom PLA2 are capable of inducing necrosis of skeletal muscle cells upon i.m. injection, and that the catalytic and myotoxic activities of bee venom PLA2 are inhibited by p-BPB. Also, melittin and contaminating PLA2 in the melittin fraction may be acting synergistically to induce a stronger and more rapid myotoxic effect than occurs with either alone.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030614390

In the first series, classical conditioning of proboscis extension was studied by confining bees to small metal tubes where they received pairings of an odor with a 3-s feeding of sucrose, After a number of odor-sucrose pairings, the bees began to extend their proboscis to the odor. Controls include Unpaired, Discrimination, and Pseudoconditioning Groups. This technique was used to look at conditioning to a light CS, and to the odors of beeswax, geraniol, citral, and hexanal. The results indicate that acquisition was best when sucrose was paired with the odor of beeswax. Conditioning to the remaining odors was roughly similar, but acquisition did not occur using a light. In a second series of experiments, odors were no longer followed by sucrose feedings and the conditioned response slowly disappeared. With the exception of geraniol as a CS, this extinction effect did not occur if the animals continued to be fed on an unpaired schedule. In a third series of experiments, conditioned inhibition was demonstrated when geraniol was used as conditioned stimuli, but no effect was found when the odors of hexanal, citral and wax were used. In a fourth series of experiments, unrestrained bees flew back and forth from the laboratory to the hive, where they were taught to distinguish targets based on color and odor. With this technique, color and odor discrimination in the Africanized bees was demonstrated. In addition, it was found that more intruder bees visited the experimental station when the stimuli used were olfactory rather than visual.","Africanized honey bees; Beeswax; Killer bees; Learning; Pavlovian conditioning; Pseudoconditioning",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030983810

The degrees of polyandry and intra-colonial genetic relatedness in A. andreniformis are similar to those in A. mellifera, slightly more than in A. florea, and up to 6 times less than in A. dorsata. We argue that while presently favoured hypotheses for the evolution of polyandry in monogynous social insects may adequately explain the evolution of up to five or six matings, they are inadequate to explain the extreme polyandry (10-60 matings) observed in Apis. One alternative possibility is that colony fitness is a non-additive function of the fitness of individual subfamilies. Such behavioral over-dominance may mean that queen fitness is increased by high levels of polyandry, which increase the probability of desirable combinations of worker genotypes occurring in one colony. The special attributes of honey bees which may lead to behavioral over-dominance include colony aggregation (which may increase the incidence of disease), and frequent long-distance migration.","Apis; Behavioral dominance; Microsatellites; Multiple mating; Polyandry",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1842364911

The colonies are defensive and demonstrate seasonal migration. Therefore, the domestication of this species in the way that the cavity nesting honey bees A mellifera and A cerano have been domesticated, has been thought to be impossible. However, in some Melaleuca forest areas of Vietnam, beekeepers use a traditional method to attract A dorscrto colonies that arrive in the area to build their nest on rafters, which have been raised before the Melaleuca trees start to bloom. This technique allows beekeepers to harvest honey two or three times from the same colony per season without destroying the bees and bee combs. Not all rafters become occupied by colonies. An experienced beekeeper may succeed in having 60% of his rafters occupied by bees but occupation may be much lower. In order to find out which factors influence occupation by A dorsata, 507 rafters (occupied and not occupied with bees) were examined in 1993 and 1994. Because of seasonal variations, data was recorded separately for dry and rainy seasons. The direction, diameter, slope of the rafter and size of the open space in front of the rafter were recorded. Percentage occupation was highest (84.9% and 91.7% in the dry and rainy seasons, respectively) for rafters with large (> 25 m diameter space) open spaces in front of them. Percentage occupation increased significantly with diameter of the rafter in the dry season, and followed this trend, but was not significant, in the rainy season. The most successful angle of slope of the rafter from the horizontal was found to range between 27° and 33.9°. We found that beekeepers mainly faced their rafters in a direction between north-east and south-east, although direction did not seem to affect the percentage occupation by A. dorsata. © 1997 International Bee Research Association.","Apis dorsata; Attracting swarms; Migration; Rafter beekeeping; Vietnam",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031507073

For the 'Imperator' line, there was no significant difference in seed production between HB or ALB treatments (2228 and 2158 mg seed/primary inflorescence; ANOV, P > 0.25), nor was there a difference in the percent seed germination between the pollination treatments (ANOV, P > 0.20).

The bivariate equilibrium size distribution of the model is derived and illustrated with parameter values used to describe AHB population dynamics. In the model, the difference between the equilibrium sizes of the two populations is a measure of the effect of migration. The distribution of this difference may be approximated by a normal distribution. The mean and variance parameters for the normal are predicted accurately by a second-order regression model based on the migration rate and the maximum size of the first population. The methodology is general, and should be useful in studying the migration effect in many other applications with one-way migration.","Carrying capacity; Coupled logistic model; Cumulants; Density-dependent growth; Quasiequilibrium distribution",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031428434

In queen larvae most ovarioles exhibit almost simultaneous formation of numerous germ cell clusters within the first 20 h after the last larval molt. Ultrastructurally distinctive fusomal cytoplasm connects these cystocytes. Germ cell differentiation is accompanied by morphological changes in somatic components of the ovarioles, the follicle and the terminal filament cells. Subsequently, queen ovarioles elongate and differentiate basal stalks that coalesce in a basal calyx. A second round of mitotic activity was found to occur in the late prepupal and early pupal queen ovary. This round may elevate germ cell numbers composing each cluster to levels observed in follicles of adult honey bee queens. In contrast, germ cell cluster formation does not occur in most of the 120–160 ovarioles of the larval worker ovary, but instead many cells in such ovarioles show signs of impending degeneration, such as large autophagic bodies. DNA extracted from worker ovaries did not reveal nucleosomal laddering, and ultrastructurally, chromatin in germ cell nuclei appeared intact. In the 4–7 surviving ovarioles of the small worker ovary, germ cell clusters were found with ultrastructural characteristics identical to those in queen ovarioles. The temporal window during which divergence in developmental pathways of the larval ovaries initiates shortly after the last larval molt coincides with caste-specific differences in juvenile hormone titer which have long been considered critical to caste-specific morphogenesis. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Apis mellifera; ultrastructure; Fusome; Germ cell cluster formation; Oogenesis; Programmed cell death",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031050311

We examined the propensity of mites to leave their hosts and to move onto new bee hosts. We also examined their preference for bees of different age and hive function. Mites were standardized by selecting mites from newly emerged worker bees (NEWs). In closed jars, 50% of Varroa left NEWs irreversibly when no physical path was present for the mites to return to the NEWs; about 90% of mites left newly emerged drones in identical assays. In petri dish arenas, mites were rarely seen off NEW hosts when monitored at 15-min intervals for 4 h; this was the case for single NEWs with one mite (NEWs+) and when a NEW+ and a NEW- (no mites) were placed together in a petri dish. When a NEW+ was held with either a nurse bee or a pollen forager, 25% of the mites moved to the older bees. When both a nurse and a pollen forager were placed in a petri dish with a NEW+, about 50% of the mites transferred to older bees; nurse bees received about 80% of these mites, whereas pollen foragers received significantly fewer mites (about 20%. P < 0.05). Most mite transfers occurred during the first 30 min after combining NEWs+ and test bees. When NEWs+ were combined with bees of known ages, rather than function, mites transferred more often to young bees than to older bees (1- and 5-day-old bees vs. 25-day-old bees, P < 0.05; 1-day-old vs. 13- and 25-day-old bees; P < 0.05). No differences in proportions of transferring mites were seen when the range of bee ages was ≤ 8 days (P > 0.05), implying that the factors mediating the mites' adult-host preference change gradually with bee age. A possible chemical basis for host choice by Varroa is indicated by their greater propensity to move onto freezer-killed nurse bees than onto freezer-killed pollen foragers (P < 0.05) and by their lower movement onto heat-treated bees than onto control bees (P < 0.05). Bee age, hive function, and directional changes in cuticular chemistry are all correlated. Movements of newly emerged mites in relation to these variables may provide insights into their reproductive success in Apis mellifera colonies.","Apis meliffera; Behavior; Honey bee; Host choice; Host preference; Varroa jacobsoni; Varroa mite",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030849743

These include the honey bee (Apis mellifera), alfalfa leafcutting bee (Megachile rotundatd), alkali bee (Nomia melanderi), and several species each of mason bees (Osmia spp.) and Bumblebees (Bombus spp.). Among these managed pollinators, only the alkali bee nests in the ground, although ground-nesting bee taxa predominate outside of the lowland tropics. Despite their many desirable qualities for agricultural pollination, including fixed host fidelity (oligolecty), superior pollination efficiencies, reliable synchronization with bloom and gregarious nesting habits, ground- nesting bees have generally defied attempts at manipulative management. Progress in managing ground-nesting bees has been impeded by our limited insights into the sensory cues and behavioral mechanisms responsible for nest site philopatry and the recruitment of females into conspecific nesting aggregations. Candidate cues include olfactory attractants (mandibular, labial and Dufour's gland secretions), visual landmarks and soil quality. The olfactory cues are likely recognized instinctively or by imprinting, possibly at eclosion. In contrast, visual cues are probably learned during orientation flights, as is known for Apis and several sphecid wasps. Specific hypotheses are reviewed and possible experimental designs are proposed in the hope of encouraging resolution of these long-standing, fundamental facets of bee biology.","Aggregation; Apis; Apoidea; Oligolecty; Pheromone; Philopatry; Pollination",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879244714

The most important plant families were Myrtaceae and Melastomataceae, which also provided most of the nectar. The Africanized honey bee mainly used plants of Myrtaceae, Asteraceae, Euphorbiaceae and Arecaceae for pollen and Cunoniaceae, Rubiaceae and Myrtaceae for nectar. Measures of trophic niche overlap indicate the importance of common resource utilization for all three species of eusocial bees. Niche overlap between Melipona bees and A mellifera was more evident for nectar than for pollen. However, the peak in pollen harvest by the colonies of stingless bees as revealed by the number of newly filled storage pots coincided with a low level of presumed competitive pressure of Africanized honey bees, which was calculated as a product of niche overlap and amount or resources harvested.

In a recognition paradigm, bees were trained to distinguish between a trained colored disk and alternative stimuli differing in their green contrast and/or chromatic contrast. Results from the first experimental paradigm allowed the establishment of αmin, the visual angle subtended by a colored target at the bee eye at which the bees detect a given stimulus with a probability P o = 0.6. This angle was 5° for stimuli presenting both chromatic contrast and green contrast, and 15° for stimuli presenting chromatic but no green contrast. Therefore, green contrast contributes decisively to the detection task. Results from the second experimental paradigm showed that chromatic and green contrasts are alternatively used depending on the visual angle subtended by a trained chromatic target and that bees also learn the green-contrast difference between a trained and a nonrewarded alternative. Finally, when trained at different visual angles with an achromatic stimulus providing green contrast, bees were capable of learning and detecting the achromatic target only for visual angles from 10° to 5°. Thus, green-contrast and chromatic-contrast channels are tuned to signals of different angular sizes: the chromatic channel conveys the signals of objects of large angular size, while the green contrast channel conveys those of objects of reduced angular size. © 1997 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030829253

Queen pupae, together with the surrounding worker pupae, were removed from each colony and analysed at two to three microsatellite loci to determine their paternity. In all three colonies, the paternity of larvae chosen by the bees to rear as queens was not a random sample of the paternities in the worker brood, with certain subfamilies being over-represented in queens. These results support an important prediction of kin selection theory: when colonies are queenless, unequal relatedness within colonies could lead to the evolution of reproductive competition, that is some subfamilies achieving greater reproductive success than others. The mechanism by which such dominance is achieved could be through a system of kin recognition and nepotism, but we conclude that genetically based differential attractiveness of larvae for rearing as queens is more likely.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031472036

The strategies were: (1), insecticide application timed to avoid peak flowering periods in sweetcorn; (2), insecticide formulation, including carbofuran, encapsulated methyl parathion, permethrin and a tank mix of car- baryl plus parathion; (3), the use of pollen traps to prevent contaminated pollen coming into the hive; and (4), feeding (engorgement) of colonies with sugar syrup immediately following insecticide application to reduce honey bee foraging. Timing of insecticide applications was ineffective and a practical impossibility. Bee mortality was less with permethrin than with the other materials tested. Pollen traps and colony feeding may reduce bee mortality under some circumstances; however, these strategies proved unreliable and further study is needed. The data show that bees foraging on ragweed (Ambrosio spp.) adjacent to sweetcorn fields, rather than on sweetcorn, may be responsible for generating the excessive bee losses associated with sweetcorn. The results further indicate that circumstances in each field are unique due to prevailing conditions at each site, e.g. clean cultivation, competing resources, insecticide tank mixes, and other nearby applications.

Some bees visited only blue flowers while others visited only yellow flowers. This paper describes the onset of constancy for bees that had no experience with the experimental apparatus. In 3020 visits, bees failed to land on or drink from the flower colour on which they first landed only 17 times. This behaviour was not modified by quality or quantity of reward, training to the experimental site, group effects or presence of odour during trials. However, when we trained bees to a target painted with two colours and then forced them to sample monomorphic flower patches in sequence, all bees visited the only colour present: yellow or blue. When we subsequently offered these same bees yellow and blue flowers simultaneously (rewarded choices), they became constant. Eleven of 23 bees showed constancy to the less rewarding flower morph without even sampling the alternative. Those bees failed to sample even though they had previously been forced to visit the alternative flower morph, which offered a reward with twice the calories/volume.

Flower age was an important correlate of secretion rate: 4 h- and 7 h-old flowers had higher secretion rates than older and younger flowers. Flower stage also explained significant variation in secretion rate, but less than age, with which it was correlated. Although secretion rates varied significantly with flower stage, standing crops did not, suggesting higher rates of depletion in flowers with higher secretion rates. The flower-probing choices of honey bees (Apis mellifera) and bumble bees (Bambus spp.) on first arrival on an inflorescence were recorded. Bees probed flowers in rapidly-secreting flower stages more often than would be expected by chance. These findings support the argument that if the probability of a visit to a given flower at a given time depends on its nectar content at that time (the standing crop), the number of visits received by that flower over a given interval depends on its secretion rate. In the case of P. tanacetifolia, the visitation rate changes over the life of a flower, as its secretion rate changes. © 1997 International Bee Research Association.","Apis mellifera; Bombus; Bumble bees; Flower choice; Flowering; Honey bees; Nectar secretion; Nectar standing crop; Phacelia tanacetifolia",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031485174

Almond (Primus amygdalus) production was examined after application of pollen to honey bees (Apis mellifera) during bloom. Pollens containing unique genetic traits were transferred to flowers by foragers and resulted in nut set. Selective pollination was achieved by use of pollen incompatible with one cultivar or performing enpollination when only one cultivar was in bloom. First, paternity tests performed on embryos measured what percent of the crop came from the extra pollen and evaluated the success of a supplemental pollination practices. Second, historical production of two untreated cultivars grown in the same field were compared with yield ratios of the same cultivars after treatment of one of them.

Many plant species are used by introduced honey bees, which suggests a high potential for disturbance of native plant/pollinatorrelationships. Few species are used intensively, however, thus decreasing the opportunity for disturbance. Pollination studies show that honey bees are effective pollinators of some native plants and less effective pollinators of others; they also reduce floral resources in some species with little or no pollination. Data are insufficient to show whether honey bee foraging on native plants significantly alters pollen and gene flow, but unusual foraging behavior by honey bees is not evident compared to many other pollinators. Honey bees do not physically damage plants; they are also unlikely to increase hybridization of native flora. Pollination by honey bees probably contributes little to the success of most weeds. Experiments have not shown competition for nesting sites between honey bees and native fauna. The presence of honey bees, however, alters the foraging behavior and abundance of some native fauna on flowers, but no studies have shown detrimental impacts of honey bees on population abundances of any native animals or plants. Anecdotal and quantitative reports of increased honey bee abundances on flowers compared with native fauna are often confounded with habitat changes induced by man.

Different entomophilous crop species are grown together in isolation sites at the IPK-genebank. These plants flower in different periods and require various pollinator species. Various bee species have been reared: Apis mellifera, Bombus spp., Psithyrus rupestris, Megachile rotundata, Osmia rufa and Anthophora acervorum as well as blow flies, flesh flies and hover flies for crop pollination in isolation cages and glass houses. Osmia rufa is the most effective pollinator, e.g. for cruciferous crops. It is very easy to handle as bee cocoons may be ordered between September and December. The flies were compared as pollinators with partially distinct flower preference. Their broader application for crop pollination and other purposes depends on a rearing technique which is usable throughout the year. This paper presents a simple and hygienic method for keeping large populations of Eristalis tenax (Syrphidae, Eristalinae) in captivity. Some information about its biology and behavior under artificial conditions in comparison with related species is given. Using Red mason bees with this common hover fly species guarantees maximum pollination, best seed set and lowest labor effort. Different pollinator densities have to be recognized, i.e. one tunnel of bee cells for the solitary bee or about 20 hover flies seems to be sufficient to pollinate about 20 m 2. Competition between these insect species was low. Discontinuity in the rearing of several species guarantees a sufficient abundance of pollinators, especially from June to August.

The evaluation of rape lines for their inocuousness to beneficial insects such as the honeybee, Apis mellifera L., were investigated because changes in the composition of nectar and pollen may occur that affect plant-honeybee interactions. The effects of these plants on bees were evaluated by acute toxicity testing of the gene products and behavioral studies of bees. Acute toxicity was determined by evaluating the mortality over 24- and 48-h periods after ingestion or injection of the gene products. For the bee behavioral study, methods used to study learning processes and foraging behavior were adapted to test the effect of the gene products at both individual and colony levels under confined conditions. The study focused on the effects of proteins inducing resistance to pest insects, cowpea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI), and resistance to fungi, chitinase, and β-1,3 glucanase. Under our experimental conditions, the 3 proteins were shown to be nontoxic at the doses tested. At the individual level, behavior experiments, based on a conditioned proboscis extension response, had the following 3 effects depending on the protein tested; (1) chitinase did not affect learning performance; (2) β-1,3 glucanase affected the level of conditioned responses, with the extinction process occurring more rapidly as the concentration increased; and (3) CpTI induced marked effects in both conditioning and testing phases, especially in high concentrations. The decrease in learning performance induced by CpTI observed at the individual level was confirmed at the colony level. Given their relative simplicity, it is suggested that such bioassays could be used for screening in the development of genetically modified plants.","Acute toxicity; Apis mellifera; Learning performances; Recombinant proteins; Risk assessment; Transgenic plants",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000914426

Colonies from 27 of these queens were tested in Louisiana and 16 were tested in Michigan. Each colony in the Louisiana test began with 986 ± 13 g (mean ± SD) of bees and ≈ 290 mites; Michigan colonies began with 3,212 ± 171 bees and ≈ 51 mites. The populations of mites and bees were measured 10 wk later. Three of the 43 colonies had fewer mites at the end of the test than at the beginning. During the experiment, we evaluated each colony for grooming behavior, hygienic behavior, the duration of the postcapping period, and the frequency of nonreproducing mites in brood cells. Of these 4 characteristics, only nonreproduction of mites was highly related to a change in the mite population. The duration of the postcapping period was marginally related, and the other 2 characteristics were apparently unrelated to the growth of the mite population. This study showed that resistance to varroa mites is present in the honey bee population in the United States, nonreproduction of mites was highly correlated with the growth of a mite population, and nonreproduction of mites may be a valuable characteristic for selecting bees for resistance to varroa mites.","Apis mellifera; Breeding; Selection; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000556592

Data on flowering phenology, plant size, fruit set, pollination and the mating system were gathered for two of these populations between March and October 1993. Flowering for both populations followed a similar pattern, with open flowers first evident in April, and the number of inflorescences with open flowers peaking in June. At both locations, trees differed considerably with respect to their size, the total number of inflorescences produced and the length of their flowering season. Fruiting success was typically low, with approximately half of all inflorescences failing to develop into infructescences. Only 1.8% of the flowers originally present on inflorescences developed into follicles. The distribution of follicles along each infructescence was non-random, with most forming in the middle third of the infructescence for reasons relating to nutrient supply and pollinator behaviour. More flowers opened during the day than at night, although pollen was lost from individual flowers during both periods. Honeyeaters such as Phylidonyris novaehollandiae were common at the two study sites, and often carried large loads of B. brownii pollen. Though less frequently caught, the nocturnal mammals Rattus fuscipes and Tarsipes restratus also bore substantial amounts of pollen. Most inflorescences from which these mammals and birds were excluded remained barren. Fruiting success was further reduced when invertebrates such as Apis mellifera were also prevented from visiting inflorescences. The ability of B. brownii to set at least some fruit in the absence of biotic polinators indicates that the species is partially self-compatible. Honeyeaters foraged preferentially at inflorescences with one to two thirds of their flowers open, probing mainly along the 'advancing front' of open flowers. These animals moved more frequently between inflorescences on the same plant than between those on different plants, and were often recaptured in the same locations.

The technique has the potential to evaluate the distance, direction, route and speed of bee flights. All of these are important when considering spatial patterns of pollinator movement. Both bumblebees and honey bees, each tagged with a small diode and wire antenna, were seen to forage on flowers. They flew to and from their colonies and were tracked by the radar on their outward and return flights. Examples of the radar tracks are described, showing differences between honey bees and bumblebees with respect to the trajectory and directness of flight route. Individuals were tracked to distances of up to 250m from their colonies though there is the potential to track them further. Each bee's air speed and heading was calculated by subtracting wind velocity from the velocity of individual bees, as measured on the radar. The mean bee air speed was 5.1(+0.3)ms', but it appeared from our data that individuals tended to modulate their air speed according to the component of wind velocity along their heading direction: the higher this component, the lower their air speed.

Possible explanations are conditional sex allocation and/or constraints on provisioning females: daughters need at least three prey items (honey bees), whereas sons need only one to develop and reproduce. If small females are not able to procure these three bees quickly enough they might have to produce sons instead. Larger females had a higher proportion of successful hunting flights, carried heavier loads, and could fly continuously with a load for longer than small females. They brought in more and heavier bees but needed less time for a single hunting trip. An estimate of the sex allocation of the food bees, based on the timing pattern of successful hunting trips, suggested that female size is positively correlated with the proportion of daughters produced.

Since that time Bumblebees pollination of greenhouse tomatoes occurs throughout the world. It appears that catching queens in spring nor the release of many colonies in tomato greenhouses have had a significant effect on the abundance of Bumblebees in nature. In Europe Bombus terrestris L. is the main species used for commercial pollination. Local species are used both in the US and Canada. Importing animal species or subspecies that are new to an area is very risky. Undesired characteristics, diseases or parasites may be imported as well. The risk is especially high if so little is known about the taxonomy, diseases and parasites as was the case with Bumblebees. In the area of distribution of Bombus terrestris mixing of subspecies has taken place and we are heading for a similar situation as is already the case in honeybees. A positive effect of the sudden economic importance of Bumblebees is that it has given an impulse to Bumblebee research. The availability of Bumblebee colonies year-round has made them to popular study objects. Several papers have been published on Bumblebee behavior and on pollination experiments with different crops. Progress has been made with respect to diseases, parasites and commensals.

Previous work has shown that virus particles can enter cucumber seedlings when virus-bearing pollen grains contact puncture holes made in plant cells by thrips feeding. Stonefruit plant parts on which pollen is deposited and thrips spend considerable time feeding, are likely sites of PNRSV inoculation. The principal agents of pollen deposition may therefore play a key role in PNRSV epidemiology. We determined the principal sites of pollen deposition on Japanese plum trees and the major pollen depositing agents in a PNRSV-infected orchard in southeastern Queensland. Plum pollen was deposited mostly onto flowers, with few grains being found on leaves or stems. Within the flowers, pollen grains were distributed mostly on the petals, but some were found on the sepals, filaments and carpels. Honey bees were the most frequent visitors to plum flowers and they deposited more than any other insects. Flies visited flowers at low frequencies and also deposited pollen. Significant amounts of pollen were deposited onto flowers by unidentified nocturnal agents. Thrips were not observed during the study period, although they were present in the orchard. Previous studies have assumed that thrips carry virus-bearing pollen as well as bring it into proximity of feeding wounds.

We propose two fundamentally different memory processes, both of winch affect feeding behavior and support matching. We suggest that in one case, the probability of choice is determined by the strength of direct associations between locally perceived odor stimuli and reward rates. In the second case, simultaneously perceived color stimuli predict the relative reward rates indirectly by the spatial representation of the four feeders.

This study was initiated to assess relationships between pollinator numbers and growth, development and yield of blueberries. During the five years of the study, pollinator numbers varied greatly among fields and among years. Weather data collected from test plots during several years suggests that local weather conditions during bloom influence pollinator numbers. Honeybee hive and hive strength numbers also influenced fruit set, berries, and yields. Yields were significantly correlated with honeybee and total pollinator numbers in three of the five years, whereas correlations with groups of native pollinators were inconsistent. A significant correlation of yield to honeybee and total pollinator numbers was observed. These results suggest that managed pollinators are necessary supplements to native pollinators in most large fields in order to ensure adequate pollination and fruit set, but may not always be necessary in small, isolated fields surrounded by wooded areas. Honeybee hives placed in blueberry fields should be as strong as possible, and should be placed at densities of five or more hives per acre.","Fruit set; Honeybees; Vaccinium angustfolium",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0009659655

Bees experienced a constant probability of death per unit time away from the colony. This leads to a log-linear survivorship curve of type II. Most bees died before reaching senescence. The patterns of survivorship are likely to influence the evolution of foraging behavior, and this result suggests that age-independent factors such as predation could play a strong role in selection of foraging range and other parameters. Our result is contrary to the pattern expected if the survivorship of individual honey bee foragers is determined largely by a limited lifetime budget of energy expenditure, which would imply a low probability of mortality early in a bee's foraging life, followed by a sharp increase in mortality late in life, when either physiological or mechanical wear cause death.","Efficiency; foraging behaviour; honey bees; survivorship",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-8244225177

These determinants work through intermediate physiological channels to realize particular patterns of division of labor. The change of juvenile hormone (JH) titer in worker bees is one such channel. Previous studies concentrated on the impact of JH on timing of in-hive and foraging activity. Here we examined the effects of JH on task specialization and the collection of pollen or nectar by same-age bees and we tested the possible impact on JH titer on foraging performance. Methoprene treatments were conducted after workers began to forage inside a flight room. We found that methoprene, a JH analogue, had no effect on preferences for pollen or nectar and, also, did not influence nectar foraging rate, nectar load size, and foraging span.","Food preferences; Foraging performance; Honey bees; Juvenile hormone; Methoprene",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030834285

The proteases, which derive from the infectious agent of AFB, Paenibacillus larvae, were unusual in being insensitive to phosphoramidon and in not degrading FAGLA, the artificial substrate specific for most Bacillus metalloproteases. The enzymes in AFB ropes and scales had temperature optima of 60-65°C and were inactivated quickly on incubation at 80°C. Activity at moderate temperatures (37°C) was great on general substrates such as casein, gelatin, and hide powder azure, slight on elastin-Congo red, and nonexistent on collagen. In SDS-polyacrylamide gels the enzymes from the various sources all had molecular weights about 24 kDa. The proteases could be detected only zymographically after brief washing to remove SDS. On silver-stained gels no bands corresponding to the enzymes' activities could be detected.

In operation, bees strike the shell of the target while attempting to sting it, causing the target to ring at its natural frequency. This sound is detected by a microphone placed inside the target and an electric signal is sent to the instrument. There each strike by a bee is counted during a defined interval. The total is stored in memory and the next interval is immediately counted. When the stored data are downloaded into a computer the temporal patterns of bee attack can be studied.

These showed that the premature death of the male offspring within the host cell leads to unfertilized adult female offspring emerging from the cell. These unfertilized mites cannot mate and so never produce viable offspring, although they do enter cells and attempt to reproduce. Therefore, virgin females cannot account for females which normally only produce male offspring, suggesting that these males are not produced parthenogenically. In the majority of mites, the type of reproductive behaviour does not change, i.e. once abnormal always abnormal.

Four honeybee colonies were administered the single dose of ABPC at the rate of 30 mg/hive by addition to sugar syrup or pollen substitute (paste) for 1 day intake. The colonies received ABPC in syrup showed high drug residue levels in honey and it lasted over 14 days beyond the detection limit of residual analysis. In the hives given ABPC in paste, relatively low honey residues were found, however, the distributions of the drug in young larvae and jelly which was the food of the larvae were very low. ABPC was considered to be a promising drug for the control of American foulbrood, an important bacterial disease of honeybee larvae, because of its high antibacterial activity to the pathogen, Paenibacillus larvae, and instability of residue in honey as human food. The low distribution in young larvae, the target of the disease, threw a doubt on the efficacy of ABPC for American foulbrood control.","American foulbrood; Ampicillin; Bacillus larvae; Honeybee; Paenibacillus larvae",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031218581

Second, by using cages with only Osmia in them. Osmia pollination was compared with honey bee, wind, self and open pollination. Comparison among treatments was by the number of drupelets and berry weight. Osmia pollination was different on the two cultivars. In the Hull Thornless cultivar, Osmia pollinated berries were significantly heavier and had more drupelets than self, wind and open pollinated ones, but were similar to honey bee pollinated berries. In the Black Satin cultivar, Osmia pollinated berries were statistically different from the open, wind, and self pollinated ones in weight and from self and wind in number of drupelets There were no differences between Osmia and honey bee pollinated berries in this cultivar. Osmia increased its population two times (588 cocoons) and the sex-ratio (M/F) was 4.5:1.

The direction of one component of the dance relative to gravity can be correlated with the direction relative to the sun that a recruited bee would have to take from the hive to reach the nectar. For the directional information contained in the dance to be useful in guiding the recruited bee, both dancer and recruit must have precise information about the direction of gravity. In this study we took flash photographs of undisturbed bees on the surface of comb while they were carrying out their normal activities. Measurements of the angular displacement of the head and abdomen in relation to the thorax showed that the abdominal, but not the head, displacement was often correlated with the direction of gravity. The exception was seen in bees oriented horizontally on comb, when many brought both heads and abdomens into line with the thorax. The morphology of the neck organs, the mechanics of the articulation between the head and thorax, and the central projections of receptors suggest a role for the neck organs in the control of the head position, perhaps during flight. The morphology of the petiolar organs and the central projection of the ventral petiolar organs confirms their role as monitors of lateral abdominal excursions.","Episternal hairplates; Gravireception; Petiolar organs",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3042888586

It has shown that in comparison with almond orchards, pollen gene flow occurs over much greater distances. Furthermore, pollen genes are being donated by more than one polleniser cultivar. For example, Sam planted at Lenswood Horticultural Centre was pollinated by both Vista and Merton Glory. Protective netting was used to exclude birds from the cherry orchard at Lenswood and only 0.003% of the apparent net pollen gene flow came from cultivars planted outside of the net to those within. The presence of bird netting discouraged the movement of honeybees. Cross-compatible pollen rather than self pollen contributed most to embryo formation in the self-fertile cultivar Stella. Seventy-one percent of embryos produced by Stella at Lenswood were as a result of outcrossing. This work has culminated in some important recommendations for the cherry industry. Namely that where bird exclosures are used bee hives and polleniser cultivars should be placed inside the netted area, and when planting self-fertile cultivars, such as Stella, polleniser cultivars should be included in the orchard plan.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030776313

Boyne and cv. Redwing. For bee-vectoring treatments, a colony box of bumblebees with about 50 workers, or a hive of honeybees with about 3000 workers, was placed in each replicate plot enclosure. Each colony box and hive was equipped with an inoculum dispenser to contaminate bees with a powder preparation of G. roseum (4.0-18.0 x 108 CFU/g). Bumblebees carried inoculum loads of 0.3-128 (̄ = 39.7) x 104 CFU/bee and honeybees carried 1.3-81)(̄ = 29.9) x 104 CFU/bee when they emerged from dispensers. Similar amounts of inoculum were delivered to raspberry flowers by bumblebees (mean daily density of 451-2461 CFU/flower) and honey bees (693-1659 CFU/flower). Bees maintained inoculum densities of ≤ 102-103 CFU/flower during 6- to 15-day study periods except when weather discouraged foraging. Inoculum density on flowers in plots that were sprayed with G. roseum (107 CFU/ml) decreased from about 102-105 to &lt; 10 CFU/flower within 2 days. Inoculum density on individual flowers varied (from 0-20,666, 0-4000, and 0-44,166 CFU/flower, respectively) in plots treated with bumblebees, honeybees, or sprays. Incidence of flowers with no inoculum was high in sprayed plots (55-57%) compared to plots treated by bumblebees (6-9%) or honeybees (14-15%). G. roseum generally suppressed B. cinerea in stamens and stigmas more effectively when applied by bees than as a spray. All treatments moderately suppressed fruit rot in cv. Boyne but not in cv. Redwing. A combination of bee-vectored G. roseum to protect flowers and a spray against direct infection of fruits is proposed to optimize fruit rot control.","Apis mellifera; Biological control; Bombus impatiens; Botrytis cinerea; Gliocladium roseum; Gray mold; Inoculum vectoring; Raspberry",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031259784

Now for 25 years animal behaviorists have worked as, or with, pollination biologists, using a range of behavioral techniques and models, to dissect and understand pollinator foraging behavior. Foragers must make decisions and choose among flowers on each departure from a flower. The choice may be of which flower to visit on the same plant or a flower of the same or different species. My work has focused on how foragers acquire information about floral characteristics and cost-gain associations, the internal representation of this information, and how the representation is used to make choices. This foraging process is illustrated through 1) studies of honey bees' subjective evaluations of costs and gains and 2) studies of choice behavior based on expected intakes of food and variation in nectar volume and concentration (risk-sensitive foraging behavior). I will focus also on the neglected area of genetically based variation in foraging behavior. In honey bees, nearly all aspects of foraging behavior studied thus far, including perception of and preferences for pollen and nectar, have a genetic component. Studies of the relationships between information available in the environment (floral color and scent, nectar distribution), mechanisms which underlie assessment of the information (perception, learning), resulting choice behavior, and the genetic contribution to these will further our understanding of pollinator behavior and its evolution.","Bumblebee; Choice-behavior; Dance language; Foraging behavior; Honey bee; Risk-sensitivity; Subjective evaluation",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879209777

Followers and dancers had a higher glucose titre than resting bees, probably because of elevated activity. Fructose titres were higher in dancers than followers, probably because dancers had recently collected nectar. During absconding, almost all of the haemolymph trehalose disappeared. This possibly was a result of the high energy demands required for long periods of hovering flight in front of the hive that are characteristic of absconding. Absconding and swarming bees may come to rest in the immediate vicinity of the hive to regenerate haemolymph trehalose titres. The trehalose titre was restored within an hour after absconding. Intense shaking and agitation of small groups of bees in a cage could not duplicate the very high level of activity during absconding. Shaking resulted in reduced glycogen levels in the flight muscles and an increased haemolymph fructose titre, but no decrease in trehalose titre. On the first clear day following several rainy days, foragers were more excited, as noted by more vigorous running about, and they had higher glucose titres and lower trehalose titres than after a sunny day. Increased foraging probably led to increased ingestion of food, which in turn lead to increased glucose titres. Bees sampled in the autumn had higher trehalose and lower glucose titres than bees sampled in the spring, and this finding may be due to more intense foraging activity in the spring. © 1997 International Bee Research Association.","Absconding; Apis mellifera; Followers; Fructose; Glucose; Glycogen; Haemolymph; Honey bees; Recruitment; Seasonal variation; Trehalose",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0039918126

The five sampling methods were: 1 m2 visual plot sampling, malaise traps, emergence traps, sweepnet, and linear transects. Bias inherent in four of these methods was estimated by comparing (chisquare analysis) the relative frequency of different bee taxa censused. The four sampling methods did sample the bee taxa with differing efficiency. Malaise traps sampled relatively fewer honey bees in the bee community, than the other methods, but sampled the andrenid bees and other small bees such as megachilids with a high degree of efficiency. Optimal within-field sample sizes for each method were determined for one level of precision (0.2) over a range of bee densities. Based solely upon the number of samples necessary to estimate the mean bee abundance observed in 1994, the visual plot method was the most efficient method followed by the malaise trap, the sweepnet, and the emergence trap. Howev,er, when labor and material costs are considered, the most efficient method for sampling the within field bee community is the visual plot count method followed closely by the sweepnet. In addition, data collected in two fields suggested that fields not dominated by honey bees are best sampled using a stratified random sampling plan compared to a completely random sampling plan. Allocation of sampling effort, irrespective of sampling methodology, is optimal when 38% of the samples are taken within a 10 m wide strip around the perimeter of the field and 62% of the samples are taken within the interior of the field. This allocation requires only 82% of the sampling effort when compared to a completely randomized design. A regional sampling plan was developed for Washington, Co., Maine from bee transect survey data collected in 1995. It was found that if all the bees in the bee community (honey bees included) were to be sampled for obtaining an estimate of regional bee abundance then the desired strategy is to take only one transect within a field and to sample as many fields as the desired precision requires (eg. 91 fields for a precision of 0.2). However, if an estimate of the regional native bee abundance is desired, the optimal strategy is to take four transects within each field and then sample the required number of fields in the region for a given level of precision (eg. 67 fields for a precision of 0.2).","Bees; Bias; Lowbush blueberry; Optimal; Pollination; Sample size",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859500207

In A. mellifera, the queen mandibular pheromone consists of 9-hydroxy- and 9-keto-2(E)-decenoic acids (9-HDA and ODA), methyl p-hydroxybenzoate (HOB), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl-ethanol (HVA), and is responsible for retinue attraction, among other functions. In retinue bioassays with workers of A. cerana (whose queens lack HVA), ODA, 9-HDA, and HOB were sufficient to elicit maximal retinue behavior. This suggests that the known queen mandibular pneromone components detected in mandibular glands of A. cerana queens constitute the functional queen mandibular pheromone in this species. Both castes of A. mellifera produce 10- and 8-carbon acids that are functionalized at the last position in the chain, and these are the predominant compounds found in worker mandibular glands. Workers of the other species also had these compounds, along with 9-HDA and ODA that are normally not present in A. mellifera worker glands. Queens and workers of each species had a unique combination of mandibular compounds. The aromatic compounds were characteristic of queens from the cavity-nesting species, A. mellifera (HOB and HVA) and A. cerana (HOB). These two species also had more pronounced differences in the mandibular blends of queens and workers than the open-nesting species, A. dorsata, A. florea, and A. andreniformis. Our results indicate that the more derived cavity-nesting species of Apis have evolved greater caste-specific differences between queens and workers and a higher number of queen pheromone components, compared to the open-nesting species. © 1997 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","Apis; Chemical signature; Honeybee; Mandibular gland; Pheromone; Queen; Worker",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000657203

There are few reports analysing the response to immunoglobulins in patients exposed to allergens in their natural habitats. Objective - The aim of this work was to discover the natural history of Apis specific IgG (IgG-ap) and IgG4 (IgG4-ap) levels in beekeepers from the Canary Islands. Methods - We studied 242 beekeepers (Bks). We used a questionnaire and measured total IgE and seric Apis specific IgE (IgE-ap), IgG-ap and IgG4-ap against Apis mellifera venom. Results - All Bks had IgG-ap and IgG4-ap. IgE-ap was positive in 160 Bks (65.6 %), but only 92 (37.6 %) Bks were considered sensitized. IgG-ap and IgG4-ap showed significant correlation (r = 0,84); IgE did not correlate with IgG-ap or IgG4-ap. There was no seasonal variation in IgG-ap or IgG4-ap. The group of sensitized Bks had significantly lower IgG-ap and IgG4-ap levels (P < 0.05). The groups with longer beekeeping activity showed significantly higher levels of IgG-ap and IgG4-ap (P < 0.001).

To relate the behavioural response directly to antennal detection abilities, a technique was developped for coupling proboscis extension responses and electroantennogram recordings, with the stimulation being provided by the effluent of a gas chromatograph (GC). Bees were conditioned with a six-component mixture being part of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) floral volatiles, and tested with the individual components separated by GC. Responses of the conditioned bees were compared to those of unconditioned bees. No behavioural response was obtained in the control group, neither to the individual components nor to the mixture. Conditioning induced behavioural responses for three components, and an increase of electroantennogram responses for all components. A second experiment was conducted with an air entrainment extract of oilseed rape flower volatiles. Behavioural responses of conditioned and unconditioned bees were recorded. Responses obtained from conditioned bees tested with the air entrainment extract showed six groups of behaviourally active GC peaks. Unconditioned bees showed the same pattern of responses but at a lower level. The coupled technique described here appears to be a reliable tool for locating active components in a synthetic as well as in a natural mixture of floral volatiles.

The most frequent clinical patterns are large local reactions and generalized, immediate type allergic reactions, such as urticaria, angioedema, asthma and anaphylactic shock. In Italy only few studies have dealt with the incidence of insect stings and of various more or less severe sting reactions. A large gap exists between the supposed prevalence of systemic reactions to hymenoptera allergy and the number of patients consulting for that reason. This gap may be related to a lack of awareness on the part of patients and/or physicians of the possibility of systemic reactions following hymenoptera stings. The estimated incidence among the population may vary considerately in the different regions dependent not only on the number and types of insects and the duration of the 'insect season' but also on the time spent outdoor. Recently, a National Register to record deaths caused by allergic reactions has been set up by the Italian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (SIAIC) which therefore includes the cases of death due to hymenoptera venom allergy, hit the figures are probably too low since several persons dying without witnesses would never be recognized as sting victims.","hymenoptera",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030923284

In this study we test whether O2 delivery limits metabolic rate during unladen hovering flight of the honeybee, Apis mellifera. Below 10 kPa PO2, wing-stroke frequency decreased, and at 5 kPa, bees could not fly. However, for PO2's ranging from 39 to 10 kPa, metabolic rate and wing stroke frequency were unaffected by PO2. Evaporative water loss rates increased by 40% at the lowest O2 tensions, which suggests that flying honeybees compensated for decreasing ambient PO2 by modulating convective ventilatory flow. Under normal sea-level conditions, O2 delivery does not limit flight metabolic rate in unladen, hovering honeybees and does not limit maximal metabolic rate. At altitudes above 3,000 m, the convective component of O2 delivery may, however, limit flight metabolic rate and flight capacity in honeybees.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031105880

The reactions most frequently observed are extensive local reactions which affect as many as 20% of stung adults. Generalized immediate allergic reactions are observed in 1% of patients. They can be fatal or induce permanent sequelae, especially neurological. It is now clearly established that desensitization must be performed with venom preparations and not with total body extracts. At a maintenance close of 100 μg, more than 90% of patients allergic to wasps are perfectly protected, versus only 75% to 80% of patients allergic to bees. A large number of studies concerning desensitization to Hymenoptera venoms, published since 1987, justified the publication of European recommendations in 1993. Although the general indications for desensitization are well established, the duration of this modality is still controversial. Some factors are recognized as being prejudicial to suspension of this treatment: the severity of the initial reaction with a persistent positive laboratory assessment, poor tolerance of desensitization, appearance of a general reaction after a sting by the Hymenoptera responsible following desensitization. Studies are still needed to define management concerning the suspension of desensitization, particularly desensitization to bee venom.","Hymenoptera; Specific desensitization",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031418819

In 1992 research has was to find out whether placing bumblebee colonies in a pear orchard could increase the frequency of flower visits by bumblebees and could improve fruitset. Flower visits by Bombus terrestris workers were rare and contributed relatively little to the flower visits of pear by insects. Flower visits in the orchard mainly came to the account of honeybees.

The sequences were produced using PCR amplification and direct sequencing of two mtDNA sequences common to all species. The two segments tested were: 1) a 897 bp region of the mt CO-I gene, and 2) a 434-881 bp region of the last part of the mt CO-I gene, the tRNAlcu gene, an intergenic region and a small section in the beginning of the CO-II gene. The comparisons of the 897 bp region of the mt CO-I gene showed that two haplotypes with a difference of 15 bp were observed - one haplotype comprising the black honeybee and one all the other subspecies. The alignments of the CO-I / CO-II regions indicate that the strains of the black honeybee could be divided into two types in the studied region: one with 685 bp comprised the Danish strain (Læsø) and the strain from Stockholm's Skærgård, and the other with 881 bp included Swedish strains from Umeå, Västerbotten and Jämtland. All the other subspecies, which in the studied region differed from each other only in a few base substitutions, have 434 bp. The length differences are mainly due to duplications in the investigated region. The study shows that the different subspecies can be identified on the basis of mtDNA. The phylogenetic analyses showed that the black honeybee, which can be further divided into different strains on basis of the number of duplications, seems to stand in an isolated position - originating presumably from a long termed isolation during and after the last glaciation. © Entomologica scandinavica (Grp. 4).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33748877399

The context in which this signal is produced suggests that it serves to stimulate more bees to function as nectar receivers, but so far there is no direct evidence of this effect. We now report an experiment which shows that more bees do begin to function as nectar receivers when foragers produce tremble dances. When we stimulated the production of tremble dances in a colony and counted the number of bees engaged in nectar reception before and after the period of intense tremble dancing, we found a dramatic increase. In two trials, the number of nectar receivers rose from 17% of the colony's population before tremble dancing to 30-50% of the population after the dancing. We also investigated which bees become the additional nectar receivers, by looking at the age composition of the receiver bees before and after the period of intense tremble dancing. We found that none of the bees recruited to the task of nectar reception were old bees, most were middle- aged bees, and some were even young bees. It remains unclear whether these auxiliary nectar receivers were previously inactive (as a reserve supply of labor) or were previously active on other tasks. Overall, this study demonstrates that a honey bee colony is able to rapidly and strongly alter its allocation of labor to adapt to environmental changes, and it further documents one of the communication mechanisms underlying this ability.","Communication; Division of labor; Honey bee; Task switching; Tremble dance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030467941

Attenuation or amplification of the vibratory signal depends on its frequency and on the type of comb. In general, framed combs, both large and small, strongly attenuate higher frequencies, whereas these are amplified in small open combs. The very poor transmission properties of the large framed combs used in commercial hives may explain the bees' habit of freeing an area of comb from the frame in those areas used for dancing. Extracellular electrical recordings from the leg of a honeybee detect large action potentials from receptors that monitor extension of the tibia on the femur. Measurements of threshold displacement amplitudes show these receptors to be sensitive to low frequencies. The amplification properties of unframed combs extend the range of these receptor systems to include frequencies that are emitted by the bee during its dance, namely the 15 Hz abdomen waggle and 250 Hz thorax vibration.","Apis mellifera carnica; Comb vibration; Communication; Honeybee; Waggle dance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001238766

Honeybees had the highest visitation rates to flowers of the three species but are relatively ineffective pollinators. Bats had higher visitation rates to flowers of cardon than birds, which had higher visitation rates to flowers of saguaro and organ pipe than bats. Results of pollinator exclusion experiments indicated that visits by bats accounted for most of the fruit set in cardon, visits by birds and bees accounted for most of the fruit set in saguaro, and birds accounted for most of the fruit set in organ pipe. Hand-pollination experiments suggest that fruit set in females but not hermaphrodites of cardon, a trioecious species, and organ pipe is pollen-limited, probably owing to the scarcity of bats. Crude estimates of the per-visit effectiveness of different groups of pollinators for fruit set indicate that bats are somewhat more effective than birds and much more effective than bees. Competition for pollinators between the three species of cacti is reduced by seasonal or daily phenological differences. The flowering seasons of cardon and saguaro broadly overlap, but these species differ in the times their flowers open and close (earlier at night and the next morning, respectively, in cardon) and in their nectar secretion schedules. Saguaro flowers are more available to diurnal pollinators than those of cardon. The flowering peak of organ pipe occurs much later in the spring than the other two species; its opening and closing and nectar secretion schedules are similar to those of cardon. At our study site, the importance of bats as pollinators of columnar cacti is currently much lower than in other arid zone columnar cacti.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030441087

Behavior of bees visiting flower patches containing blue and yellow flowers was compared to behavior on flower patches containing blue and white flowers. When presented blue-yellow dimorphic flower patches some bees visited only blue flowers while the remaining bees limited visitation to yellow flowers. That flower fidelity persisted in spite of reward quality, quantity, or frequency differences existing between flower colors (Individual Constancy Behavior). In contrast, bees visiting blue-white dimorphic flower patches each extensively visited both blue and white flowers when rewards did not differ between the two flower colors. However, bees limited visitation to the blue color morph when blue flowers offered a reward of higher quality than that offered by white flowers. Those bees would switch to white flowers when the white color morph contained the higher quality reward (Energy Maximization Behavior). Bees did not respond to reward quantity differences on blue-white dimorphic flower patches, nor was a consistent response to reward frequency differences observed on blue-white dimorphic flower patches.

Total IgE was 27 Ul/ml. Specific IgE against Polistes spp, Vespula spp, and Apis mellifera were inferior to 0.35 kU/L (CAP System). Prick and intradermal tests with all those venoms proved negative (Venomil®, Miles Inc Pharmaceutical Division, Elkhart, USA). Two months later he was stung by a 'wasp' suffering a shock anaphylactic. We repeated the allergologic study 6 weeks after that with the following findings: specific IgE against Polistes spp was 0.86 kU/l, and intradermal tests with Polistes spp was positive at a concentration of 1 μgr/ml. Cutaneous tests and serum specific IgE against Vespula spp and Apis mellifera were negative. Serum specific IgE against Polistes spp was determined monthly, and a progressive decrease of the levels was observed. In fact, those levels became negative within 6 months. In summary, we wish to emphasize in our case the fast extinction of wasp venom sensitization. Furthermore, we suggest that cutaneous tests could stimulate the immunologic memory in our patient, so that he could have specific IgE levels enough to develop a systemic reaction when he was stung 2 months later.","cutaneous tests; hymenoptera venoms; hypersensitivity; IgE; wasp venoms",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030429373

From spring until summer the insects were observed on 13 different species of plants while foraging nectar and pollen within their natural environment. In this way it was possible for the first time to measure the body surface temperatures of all three parts of the body continuously and often simultaneously without disturbing the animals in their activity. It was remarkable that in spring at an ambient temperature from 12-20°C on average the thorax was warmer by 6.4°C and the head by 4.1°C than in summer (ambient temperature: 20-26°C). The temperatures of all three parts of the body always exceeded ambient temperature. The thorax was the warmest part of the body. Concerning caput and abdomen, which were distinctly cooler, a slight dependence on the ambient temperature could be observed. The temperature of the abdomen, the coolest part of the body, never fell below 20.6°C. It was obvious that heat was exchanged between the thorax and the two other parts of the body. The average thoracic temperature amounted to 35.7°C in spring and to 29.3°C in summer. The mean temperature of the head was 30.9°C in spring and 26.8°C in summer, that of the abdomen 25.2°C and 23.1°C.

They leave their colony and arrive at the water source with ≤1 mg sugar in their crops, which they dilute at the water source by collecting about 40 μl of water. In 500 m flights back to the colony, radioisotope studies show they pass almost no crop contents to their midgut. If prevented from entering the colony for 15-36 min, they do pass about half of their crop contents to their midgut, probably when hemolymph sugar levels become very low. This water is rapidly absorbed from the midgut to hemolymph, and then is apparently rapidly excreted to the rectum via the Malpighian tubules and defecated. In this process the bee absorbs and excretes a volume of water at least as great as her entire hemolymph volume in a relatively short time (≤20 min). The return flights of water collecting bees are normally fueled from sugar reserves in the bees' bodies, and these reserves limit water collection to within a few kilometers of the colony. This limitation probably affects dispersal and density of honey bees in arid areas.","Apis; Energetics; Excretion; Foraging; Isotopes; Water-collection",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030289639

Flying endothermic insects, including the honeybee Apis mellifera, are believed to thermoregulate almost exclusively by varying heat loss. Here it is shown that a rise in air temperature from 20° to 40°C causes large decreases in metabolic heat production and wing-beat frequency in honeybees during hovering, agitated, or loaded flight. Thus, variation in heat production may be the primary mechanism for achieving thermal stability in flying honeybees, and this mechanism may occur commonly in endothermic insects.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029744092

Hormonal and genetic mechanisms regulating temporal polyethism in worker honey bees have been identified, but the evolution of these mechanisms is not well understood. We performed three experiments with male honey bees (drones) to investigate how mechanisms regulating temporal polyethism may have evolved because, relative to workers, drones display an intriguing combination of similarities and differences in behavioral development. We report that behavioral development in drones is regulated by mechanisms common to workers. In experiment 1, drones treated with the juvenile hormone (JH) analog methoprene started flying at significantly younger ages than did control drones, as is the case for workers. In experiment 2, there was an age-related increase in JH associated with the onset of drone flight, as in workers. In experiment 3, drones derived from workers with fast rates of behavioral development themselves started flying at younger ages than drones derived from workers with slower rates of behavioral development. These results suggest that endocrine and genetic mechanisms associated with temporal polyethism did not evolve strictly within the context of worker social behavior.","Apis mellifera; behavior genetics; juvenile hormone; temporal polyethism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029858913

The objective was to detect differences in the critical electrolyte concentration (CEC) for the chromatin of these cells, even though an HI histone has also been assumed to occur in the spermatozoa of A. mellifera. The CEC values were found to be the same for the different somatic cells analysed but to be higher in the spermatozoa, with even increased values after the lodging of these cells in the queen's spermatheca. A greater availability of DNA phosphates for the dye-Mg2+ competitive binding action was thus demonstrated for the spermatozoa compared to the somatic cells in A. mellifera. This is attributed to differences in their DNA-protein complexes, contributing to differences in chromatin packing states. The increased CEC found in the spermatozoa inside the spermatheca is certainly related to additional changes affecting the DNA-protein complex in the chromatin of the male cells after they penetrate the female tract.","Critical electrolyte concentration; DNA-protein complexes; HI histone; Honey bee; Spermatozoa",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030239942

The molecular basis for these diverse properties is not known. Since the role of the nuclear factor NF-κB in these responses has been documented, we examined the effect of CAPE on this transcription factor. Our results show that the activation of NF-κB by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is completely blocked by CAPE in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Besides TNF, CAPE also inhibited NF-κB activation induced by other inflammatory agents including phorbol ester, ceramide, hydrogen peroxide, and okadaic acid. Since the reducing agents reversed the inhibitory effect of CAPE, it suggests the role of critical sulfhydryl groups in NF-κB activation. CAPE prevented the translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB to the nucleus and had no significant effect on TNF-induced IκBα degradation, but did delay IκBα resynthesis. The effect of CAPE on inhibition of NF-κB binding to the DNA was specific, in as much as binding of other transcription factors including AP-1, Oct-1, and TFIID to their DNA were not affected. When various synthetic structural analogues of CAPE were examined, it was found that a bicyclic, rotationally constrained, 5,6- dihydroxy form was superactive, whereas 6,7-dihydroxy variant was least active. Thus, overall our results demonstrate that CAPE is a potent and a specific inhibitor of NF-κB activation and this may provide the molecular basis for its multiple immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory activities.","ceramide; hydrogen peroxide; okadaic acid; phorbol ester; tumor necrosis factor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029810902

Reductions in agricultural land, and changes in agricultural practices, have further led to decreases in nectar producing bee forage. Experimental field sites with 15 herb species have been established to demonstrate to beekeepers the attractiveness of alternative bee forages to bees. Flowering duration was recorded during the 1995 growing season, for each species planted in 1994. Two of these species, anise hyssop and catnip, were also planted in nine row width-density spacings. Canopy closure was delayed in the widest row widths of 0.9 and 1.35 m for anise hyssop and catnip respectively. A further field study examined the impact of weeds. Inflorescence number in the weedy check was only 8% of inflorescence number in the hand weeded plots.

Black and white patterns were partially covered to see whether the bees use the centre or the periphery of a target, and with what cues. A new technique, testing trained bees with one or more black spots on an otherwise blank target, probes the memory of the spatial distribution of black areas within the patterns. The results show that bees discriminate the orientation cues averaged over medium-sized regions in each part of a target, including the periphery subtending up to 100°at the point of choice. With large patterns, although the bees remember the predominant edge orientation in well separated areas of the image, they primarily use the spatial lay-out of black areas in the margin irrespective of the edge orientations. Confirming the above, the discrimination of a large right-angled cross from the same pattern rotated in the vertical plane by 45°depends upon its angular size, and the principal cues are the locations of the ends of the arms.","Honeybee; Learning; Target size; Vision",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030180559

In some cases pesticide mixtures, particularly those involving insecticides, have been shown to be synergistic, with reported increases in toxicity of up to 100-fold. However, these effects are species, time and dose dependent and are therefore difficult to predict routinely. It is suggested that risk assessments should routinely take additive toxicity into account and those based on synergism should be targeted at those mixtures for which a further defined increase in toxicity would result in a high-risk classification. In order to support this risk assessment approach there is a need to develop and validate a standard in vivo test in order to confirm the interaction in those cases where additive or synergistic toxicity results in a high-risk classification.","Pesticides; Risk assessment; Synergism; Wildlife",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029662668

Box 56, Dunedin, New Zealand","Adult worker honey bees alter their behaviour with age but retain a strong reliance on sensory information from the antennae. The antennae house a diverse array of receptors, including mechanoreceptors, hygroreceptors, olfactory receptors, and contact chemoreceptors, which relay information to the brain. Antennal sensory neurons that project to the antennal lobes of the brain converge onto second-order interneurones to form discrete spheres of neuropil, called glomeruli. The spatial organisation of glomeruli in the antennal lobes of the honey bee is constant, but the central distribution of information from receptors tuned to different sensory modalities is unknown. Here we show that the glomerular neuropil of the antennal lobes undergoes constant modification during the lifetime of the adult worker bee. Changes in morphology are site specific and highly predictable. The total volume of the glomerular neuropil of the antennal lobe increased significantly during the first 4 days of adult life. Each of the five readily identifiable glomeruli examined in this study exhibited a unique pattern of growth. The growth of two of the five glomeruli changed dramatically with the shift to foraging duties. Furthermore, significant differences were identified between the antennal lobes of bees performing nectar- and pollen-foraging tasks. The highly compartmentalized nature of the antennal lobes, the ease with which specific glomeruli can be identified, and the predictability of changes to the antennal lobe neuropil make this an ideal system for examining the mechanisms and behavioural consequences of structural plasticity in primary sensory centres of the brain.","Apis mellifera; olfactory bulbs; stereology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030040964

A major implication of flexible pedicels is that flowers may move during pollination. We examined whether such motion affected interactions between ruby-throated hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris) and jewelweed (Impatiens capensis) by increasing pollen deposition and by altering the effectiveness of nectar removal. For I. capensis, flower mobility enhanced pollen deposition: birds had significantly longer contact with anthers and more pollen deposited on their bills and crowns when foraging at mobile flowers than at flowers that had been experimentally immobilized. In contrast, flower mobility imposed a cost on hummingbirds by significantly increasing their handling times and reducing their extraction rates relative to their interactions with immobile flowers. Field observations indicated that the motion observed during hummingbird visits did not occur when bees (Bombus spp., Apis mellifera) visited I. capensis flowers, which suggests that the mobility of I. capensis flowers is an adaptation for hummingbird pollination.","Archilochus colubris; Flower morphology; Hummingbird; Impatiens capensis; Pollination",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029750764

In A mellifera colonies, phoretic mites were also removed by the bees but less effectively than in A cerana colonies. The proportion of experimentally-added live mites in the debris that were visibly damaged in colonies of A cerana was 30% (n = 115).

Since no reproduction of Varroa mites occurs in worker brood in A cerana, extremely effective grooming behavior may not be needed to explain the tolerance of A cerana to Varroa mite infestations.

Nests occurred predominantly in wooden cavities, particularly in abandoned woodpecker nests in dead palm trees. Nest cavities had a volume of ≃33 liters and south-facing, top-located entrances. Colonies constructed ≃6,000 cm2 of comb, devoted the majority of comb area to worker brood production, stored relatively little food, and allocated ≃8% of comb area to drone rearing. A comparison of the A. m. scutellata colonies in the Okavango with neotropical African colonies throughout Central and South America revealed that the neotropical colonies were more likely to construct exposed comb nests and less likely to occupy wooden cavities. However, no differences were found between the Okavango and neotropical colonies in nest density, cavity volume, total comb area, or the proportions of comb devoted to worker brood production, food storage or drone rearing.

FA is an indirect measure of developmental homeostasis - the ability of individuals to develop normal phenotypes despite genetic and environmental stresses. Heterozygosity is thought to have a positive influence on developmental homeostasis; hence we hypothesized that honeybees heterozygous for the MDH locus would have greater developmental homeostasis and less FA than homozygotes. Our data support this hypothesis. For one of the five characters measured, MDH heterozygotes displayed less FA than homozygotes in both colonies we examined. We also detected differences in character size and character correlation between MDH heterozygotes and homozygotes, although these patterns were not consistent across colonies.

Eighty-five alleles, consisting of MspI and Odd RFLPs, were found among the Old and New World bees tested. Forty-one MspI and 43 DdeI restriction fragment patterns, or variants, were identified. Variants and alleles were discontinuously distributed in Old World European and African subspecies. Principal coordinate analysis of the genetic distances between the alleles resulted in the identification of three distinct groups corresponding to three groups of honey bee races with historically different geographical distributions: east European A. m. ligustica and A. m. caucasica; west European A. m. mellifera; and South African A. m. scutellata. The clustering of alleles into these groups is consistent with previous honey bee phylogeographic studies, employing other nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers, which in part support the evolutionary history of the honey bee hypothesized by Ruttner based on morphometric and allozyme data. The majority of alleles in bees from the USA grouped with those found in east European bees while other alleles grouped with alleles found in A. m. mellifera. While the majority of the alleles in neotropical bees grouped with or were identical to African alleles, other alleles grouped with alleles found in A. m. mellifera, A. m. ligustica, and A. m. caucasica. Clues to the ancestry of neotropical bees may be found in the identification of alleles that were identical or more similar to alleles found in South African and west European bees; evidence for west European ancestry has been suggested using other taxonomic characters that were not unique to west European bees. Both west European and African alleles were found in individual neotropical colonies, which may indicate that honey bee subspecies which evolved allopatrically have hybridized in the human-assisted extension of their original geographical ranges.","African bees; Apis mellifera; Discontinuous variation; Geographical origins; Principal coordinate analysis; RFLPs",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000443186

The maximization of inclusive fitness has been studied in eusocial arrhenotokous species, but not in thelytokous ones. Thelytokous worker offspring are female, consequently the kin-structure of colonies is altered. This difference leads to changes in kin-value asymmetries and kin-selection. Following from these changes many of the predictions regarding conflict in thelytokous species differ quantitatively or even qualitatively from those for arrhenotokous species. In A. m. capensis inclusive fitness arguments predict more conflict between workers over reproductive dominance, especially when the colony is queenless. Some of the unique traits of Cape honeybee workers upon queen-loss, for example: (i) extreme aggression amongst workers; (ii) very rapid development of ovaries; and (iii) queen-like pheromones in workers upon queen-loss can be explained as responses to such selection. It is predicted that workers will remove (police) less of their fellow workers' eggs than other races. © 1996 The Royal Society.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030456243

The time needed by the B-bee to reach the vial bottom was recorded for different disturbances (delay response). Honeybees rejected the vial where another bee was confined; results are thus consistent with the release of deterrents by A-bees. The delay response of B-bees increased with the confinement time and with the pressure applied to A-bees. Pressing was more efficient in eliciting the release of deterrents. Both mandibular glands and sting chamber contributed to the delay response. Beheaded A-bees elicited a greater delay response; thus, the release of substances from the sting chamber may be under the control of a central inhibition that disappears when the head is removed. An annual fluctuation in the delay response occurred. Maximal values were attained shortly after the period of abundant nectar flow. Tests with head- or sting-chamber squashes reveal that such fluctuation was associated with deterrents from the head. These could have an adaptive value in a foraging context.

In cross-fostering experiments using six colonies of Apis mellifera carnica, in addition to the genotype of worker brood, the nursing colony also affected the duration of the postcapping stage. Regression analysis of postcapping duration on precapping duration showed that the relationship was negative and highly significant (b = −0.05, P < 0.001), so that a shorter postcapping stage was partly compensated for by a longer precapping period. The ratio between postcapping and precapping periods was significantly affected by genotype of worker brood (P < 0.001), by effects of the precapping nurse colony (P = 0.008) and by effects of the postcapping nurse colony (P < 0.001). The duration of the precapping and postcapping stages and the inverse relationship between them was shown to have a genetic basis. The results show that the nurse colony has an important impact on the duration of the postcapping stage and this should be considered in selection programmes. © 1996 International Bee Research Association.","Apis mellifera carnica; Brood rearing; Development; Genotype; Honey bee brood; Honey bee colonies; Inheritance; Postcapping period; Resistance; Selection; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-18144396210

At each of 3 polymorphic regions, 1 of 2 allelic sequences (representing the presence or absence of a restriction enzyme site) is specific to a different subspecies group. For each region, 3 primers are synthesized: 2 that differ by 1 nucleotide at the 3′ end, representing the 2 allelic forms, and 1 that serves as a common primer for the distal end of the region to be amplified. In 1 type of ASA test, the allelic primers are used in separate polymerase chain reactions, together with the common primer, for each of the 3 regions. Significant amplification is achieved only in those reactions that have primers that match the mtDNA sequence, thereby identifying the mtDNA type. In another type of ASA test, the allelic primers are differentially labeled with fluorescent dyes, and both are included as competitors in the same reaction along with the common primer. The primers that match the mtDNA sequences preferentially support amplification, and the colors of the amplified products identify the mtDNA type. The 3 polymorphic regions of honey bee mtDNA can be amplified in a single multiplex reaction. Advantages and limitations of ASA tests, as well as instrumentation and modifications which would enable automation, are discussed.","Allele-specific amplification; Fluorescent-labeled primers; Honey bee subspecies; Identification; Mitochondrial DNA; Polymerase chain reaction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343841550

After treating larvae with 20 μg DDVR we observed severe or total inhibition of activity of esterases Est-2, Est-2a, Est-3, Est-4 and Est-5. Only Est-1 activity was unaffected by this treatment. Nevertheless, all treated larvae transformed to prepupae and the prepupae-pupae transition and subsequent pupal development were followed by the recovery of Est-2, Est-3, Est-4 and Est-5 activities. However, the transition to pupae did not occur when prepupae were treated with DDVP. Electrophoretic analysis of prepupae after treatment showed that, except for Est-1, which was insensitive to DDVP, and Est-2a, which was not inhibited fully, the remaining esterases (Est-2, Est-3, Est-4 and Est-5) were inhibited permanently.

We documented the distribution and spread of Africanized honey bees at 15 localities across Yucatan by sampling worker honey bees from more than 280 managed colonies per year from 1990 to 1994, and from over 60 feral colonies per year at the same localities from 1992 to 1994. Colonies were classified morphometrically, using the criteria of Rinderer et al. (1993a) for managed colonies and using modified probabilities for feral colonies. Africanized honey bees spread from the south, and by 1991 were found throughout Yucatan in managed colonies. By 1994, 52% of managed colonies were classified as pure Africanized and, assuming linearity in the rate of Africanization, all managed colonies are projected to be Africanized by mid-1997. Feral colonies showed evidence of Europeanization in 1992 but, by 1994, they were classified as Africanized. The slower pace of Africanization of managed colonies than that predicted for Yucatan may have arisen from extensive hybridization between the incoming Africanized honey bees and the large resident European honey bee population of the state, which contained among the highest densities of managed European colonies in the world before 1987. As yet, there is no evidence of a reduction in honey production in Yucatan. © 1996 International Bee Research Association.","Africanized honey bees; Apis mellifera; Distribution; European honey bees; Hybridization; Mexico; Morphometrics; Range expansion; Taxonomy; Yucatan",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030326872

The choice table consisted of a wooden grid with alternated male and female inflorescences of sumac. Honey bee activity was recorded also on inflorescences of naturally growing plants in which the secretion of nectar was measured and the anther dehiscence recorded. Honey bees were the only common pollinators observed on sumac in the study area. During the morning, both plant sexes secreted little nectar, and pollen was available after the dehiscence of the anthers which took place between 1000 and 1100 hours. Female inflorescences secreted great amounts of nectar during the afternoon, but in male inflorescences there was little secretion. Honey bees seemed to forage according to the circadian availability of resources. Most of their activity concentrated on male inflorescences in the morning and on female ones during the afternoon. Both the occurrence of bees with pollen loads in their corbiculae and the length of the visits to each sex also seemed to be in accordance to the kind of resource exploited at particular times of the day. Most of the bees with pollen loads were observed during the morning and the longest visits to any inflorescences were registered on female ones during the afternoon (by bees foraging for nectar).

Semen samples were collected from ejaculates and seminal vesicles of mature (n-100) and from seminal vesicles of immature (n=50) drones. After additional preparation, semen aliquots were incubated in a biotinylated solution with lectins Bauhinia purpurea (BPA), Canavalina ensiformis (ConA) and Arachis hypogea (PNA). Qualitative binding differences were observed with light and transmission electron microscopy. In mature drones, the 3 lectins showed the staining patterns characteristic for each lectin, but there were no differences in binding between spermatozoa from seminal vesicles and from ejaculates. Spermatozoa from immature drones showed binding only with BPA. Observation with electron microscopy confirmed the findings seen with light microscopy. Our findings support the hypothesis that spermatozoal plasma membrane surface undergoes changes in some glycoprotein composition as the drone matures, and that in the mature drone, there are no such changes during the passage through the ductus deferens at ejaculation.","drone spermatozoa; electron microscopy; Lectin",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030197988

To understand the population dynamics of the Varroa mite it is necessary to know the number of fertile female offspring each Varroa female produces during her lifetime. The lifetime reproduction capacity of the mite consists of the mean number of fertile female offspring produced during each reproductive cycle multiplied by the mean number of cell passages. This paper describes an experimental design to estimate the number of reproductive cycles where mites are transferred to new mite-free colonies for reproduction in sealed brood cells. The data presented suggests that the mean number of reproductive cycles performed by the individual female mite is larger than previously accepted. Under optimal conditions, the mean number of reproductive cycles by Varroa females is probably greater than 1.5 but less than 2. Furthermore, the results show that the reproductive success of Varroa females going into cells to reproduce is not influenced by previous brood cycles. © 1996 Chapman & Hall.","Apis mellifera; Reproductive cycles; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029661402

The alignment of the drone's longitudinal body axis coincides fairly well with the line connecting drone and queen (drone- queen-axis), its mean angular deviation from this line being only 14. Angles between -5 and 5 occur most frequently (Fig. 5B). Thus, drones head straight to the queen. 2.

Studies conducted on immature worker bees maintained in the laboratory revealed that honey bee larvae could tolerate quite a range of doses of antibiotic in their diet. Intermediate doses of tylosin protected very young larvae from becoming infected by Bacillus larvae at a concentration of 1.5 × 108 spores/ml of diet. Antibiotic treatment had no measurable effects on larval or pupal developmental rates until the dose reached a lethal level. Bees in field colonies readily consumed tylosin in powered sugar, up to a level of 800 mg/7 g sugar. No negative colony effects were noted at any dosage rates. Protection against infection by American foulbrood was compared to results obtained with 200 mg Terramycin, the standard dose of the only substance currently registered for foulbrood control. Both 200 mg Terramycin and 100 mg tylosin protected the colonies for up to 3 weeks. A 200-mg dose of tylosin protected the colony for an additional week.

The developmental-programme model asserts a causal relationship between age and task performance. The foraging-for-work model asserts that this relationship is an epiphenomenon associated with a self-organizing system. The effect of a worker's pre-foraging environment on task selection as a forager was also examined. Four groups of workers, emerging at 6-day intervals, were introduced to a colony. Workers in group 1 were introduced when less than 12 h old. Workers in groups 2 and 3 were divided into deprived and non-deprived groups. Non-deprived groups were introduced to the colony when less than 12 h old. Deprived groups were confined to an incubator for 12 days and 6 days, respectively, then introduced to the colony along with group 4 (< 12 h old). Foraging activities were quantified for two sets of workers from strains of bees selected for high and low pollen hoarding. The results support the developmental-programme model. Non-deprived workers began foraging in the order that they were introduced. Deprived workers from groups 2 and 3 began to forage before younger workers in group 4, even though all three groups were introduced to the colony at the same time. The results also suggest that a forager's task selection is primarily determined by her genotype and immediate environment. High-strain workers collected pollen more often than low-strain workers, regardless of their pre-foraging environments. Differences between deprived and non-deprived groups of the same strain and age were rare. © 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029666907

Honeybee density was significantly higher on the apetalous line when their foraging activity was rather high. Honeybees showed a considerable constancy to each flower type. Passages between both types were not very frequent. Nectar foraging behaviour, observed under cages, differed with the floral morphology. On the petalous flowers, honeybees visited the two inner nectaries by crawling over the anthers and the stigma, while on the apetalous ones they often inserted their tongues between the sepals, thus having less contact with the reproductive organs. From these results, the honeybee efficiency in cross-pollination between petalous and apetalous lines appears to be reduced.","apetalous; Apis mellifera; Brassica napus; foraging behaviour; hybrid seed production; nectar-composition pollination",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030426018

When workers were fed pollen and exposed to CO2, their ovaries were less developed and brain dopamine (DA), tryptophan (TRP) and tyrosine (TYR) levels were significantly reduced versus untreated controls that were also fed pollen. If workers were not fed pollen and exposed to CO2, the differences in brain amine content between untreated controls and CO2-treated workers were not significant; however, a significant reduction in brain TRP and TYR levels through time was found for both groups of workers. Treatment with CO2 stimulated free-running queens to lay eggs sooner than untreated free-running queens, but CO2 narcosis had no significant affect on queen brain chemistry. However, the brain chemistry of caged queens (many queens caged within a single colony) responded differently from free-running queens. Treatment with CO2 caused a 45% reduction in dopamine levels in the brains of free-running queens, whereas dopamine levels of caged queens were not affected by treatment with CO2. This study shows that the brain dopamine levels of workers and queens do not change to the same degree in response to CO2 treatment For workers, this study suggests a positive relationship between brain dopamine and the extent of ovarian development. © 1996 International Bee Research Association.","Amines; Apis mellifera; Brain; CO2 narcosis; Dopamine; Feeding pollen; Octopamine; Ovarian development; Queen honey bees; Serotonin; Tryptophan; Tyrosine; Worker honey bees",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030359677

Individual forages did not activity rates or nectar sizes in response to changes in honey stores, and colonies did not increase nectar rates when honey stores within the hive were decreased. This result contrasts with pollen foraging behavior, which is extremely sensitive to colony state. Our data show that individual foraging decision during nectar and colony regulation of nectar intake are distinctly different from pollen foraging.

QMP of mated European queens showed significantly greater quantities of individual components than all queen types compared, except for a significantly greater quantity of 9-hydroxy-(E)-2-decenoic acid (9-HDA) found in Africanized queens. Glands of European drone-laying queens contained quantities intermediate between virgin and mated queens, reflecting their intermediate reproductive state and age. QMP ontogeny shifts from a high proportion of 9-keto-(E)-2-decenoic acid (ODA) in young unmated queens to roughly equal proportions of ODA and 9-HDA in mated queens. A biosynthetic shift occurs after mating that results in a greater proportion of 9-HDA, methyl p-hydroxybenzoate (HOB), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylethanol (HVA) production, accompanied by a decreased proportion of ODA.

Our results indicate that trophallaxis between young donor workers and newly emerged recipient worker bees is not the key factor for regular development and activity of the hypopharyngeal glands.","age; Apis mellifera; cage condition; food exchange; hypopharyngeal glands; protein metabolism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030469239

The results were as follows: 1. the bees elicited some characteristic behaviors when chemical alarm messages were presented, 2. agression (stinging) was not completed with any compound tested, probably because there was not a target (visual stimulus), 3. in all situations the attraction to scent source was low, 4. all the behaviors were elicited in a temporarily different way, 5. the compounds that elicited stronger responses and a greater number of the investigated behaviors were: isopentyl acetate, 2-heptanone, octyl acetate and n-octyl alcohol.

The sequences were produced using PCR amplification and direct sequencing of two mtDNA sequences common to all species. The two segments tested were: 1) a 897 bp region of the mt CO-I gene, and 2) a 434-881 bp region of the last part of the mt CO-I gene, the tRNAleu gene, an intergenic region and a small section in the beginning of the CO-II gene. The comparisons of the 897 bp region of the mt CO-I gene showed that two haplotypes with a difference of 15 bp were observed - one haplotype comprising the black honeybee and one all the other subspecies. The alignments of the CO-I / CO-II regions indicate that the strains of the black honeybee could be divided into two types in the studied region: one with 685 bp comprised the Danish strain (Læsø) and the strain from Stockholm's Skærgård, and the other with 881 bp included Swedish strains from Umeå, Västerbotten and Jämtland. All the other subspecies, which in the studied region differed from each other only in a few base substitutions, have 434 bp. The length differences are mainly due to duplications in the investigated region. The study shows that the different subspecies can be identified on the basis of mtDNA. The phylogenetic analyses showed that the black honeybee, which can be further divided into different strains on basis of the number of duplications, seems to stand in an isolated position - originating presumably from a long termed isolation during and after the last glaciation.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030240840

To test this idea, the dance language of the giant honeybee Apis laboriosa, which is closely related to Apis dorsata, but exclusively diurnal, was studied. We observed the dances, determined the flight range and recorded and analyzed acoustic signals emitted by worker bees. The dances of this species do not contain any acoustic signals, indicating that acoustic signalling of the location of food sources is indeed restricted to species which need to dance under low light intensities.

The complete separation of A nuluensis drone flight time from the other two cavity dwelling Apis species of Borneo functions as a premating barrier and results in complete reproductive isolation.

When V multimaculata was present, guard bees frequently performed body shaking behavior: bees lifted the tip of the abdomen slightly spreading the wings and exposed the Nasonov gland. The oscillation of the abdomen tip had an amplitude of 83° (SD = 50°; n = 84) and its duration was 0.08 s (SD = 0.01; n = 84). The individual behavior resulted in the rapid formation of a group of guard bees and induced body shaking of neighboring bees. The hunting V multimaculata workers hovered about 5-10 cm in front of the nest and blocked the direct flight path of bees returning to the nest. Returning foragers are regularly diverted from the nest entrances and attracted to the body shaking guard bees where they land beyond the reach of hovering V multimaculata. In contrast to Apis cerana, A nuluensis exposes its Nasonov gland during body shaking. During a period of 12 h one Vmultimaculata worker caught 14 bees.

The vertical body orientations of the bees in the curtain then become more and more 'disordered'. In one nest, the total percentage of bees which flew off was less than 20% and the maximum number of hovering bees at a moment was 2-3% of the bee colony. Half of the curtain bees in the surface layer changed their position. The median moving index was below 0.3 mm/s in the quiescent condition and it rose up to 1.0 mm/s during massed flight activity. Our observations indicate that this kind of massed flight is quite different from the great defecation activities reported previously. Although there are diverse forms of massed flight activities in A dorsata, we found that this form of massed flight activity causes the periodical rearrangement of the roofing layer of curtain.

Behavioural parameters of dancing, such as probability, duration and dance tempo, increased with the nectar flow rate, though with very different response curves among bees. For trophallaxis (i.e. mouth-to-mouth exchange of food), the frequency of givingcontacts and the transfer rate of the nectar increased with the nectar flow rate. After unloading, foragers often approached other nest mates and begged for food before returning to the food source. This behaviour was less frequent at higher nectar flow rates. These results show that the profitability of a food source in terms of nectar flow rate had a quantitative representation in the hive through quantitative changes in trophallactic and dancing behaviour.

Forager densities varied widely between days but under good weather conditions reached 9 bees/ tree for up to 6 h a day. Neither nectar volume nor its composition appeared likely to reduce foraging activity. ‘Sundrop’ flowers held up to 20 μl of nectar at an initial concentration of ∼5% sugar.

Drosophila has proved to be invaluable in the genetic dissection of learning. Through analysis of learning and memory mutants the biochemistry of critical steps has been elucidated and the temporal phases of memory in the fly have been described. Two regions of brain neurophil are essential for olfactory learning in these species: the antennal lobes and the mushroom bodies.

They were subsequently tested with different subtended visual angles of that spot, generated by different disk diameters and different distances from the decision point in the device. Bees were trained easily to detect bee-chromatic colours, but not an achromatic one. Chromatic contrast was not the only parameter allowing learning and, therefore, detection: αmin, the subtended visual angle at which the bees detect a given stimulus with a probability P0 = 0.6, was 5° for stimuli presenting both chromatic contrast and contrast for the green photoreceptors [i.e. excitation difference in the green photoreceptors, between target and background (green contrast)], and 15° for stimuli presenting chromatic but no green contrast. Our results suggest that green contrast can be utilized for target detection if target recognition has been established by means of the colour vision system. The green-contrast signal would be used as a far-distance signal for flower detection. This signal would always be detected before chromatic contrast during an approach flight and would be learned in compound with chromatic contrast, in a facilitation-like process.","Apis mellifera; Colour vision; Detection; Honeybees",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030028422

The effects of food- source odours and of the hive's odour on subsequent laboratory proboscis extension performance were tested. There was a transfer effect for odours from a food source to proboscis extension reflex conditioning in the laboratory: bees extended their proboscis in response to food-source odour and showed resistance to its extinction. Hive odour had no detectable effect. Thus, the observed transfer effect for food-source odours was likely to be caused by memories established during foraging rather than by within-hive experience with the scent of harvested food. The observed transfer effect for odours from a food source thus points to a surprisingly weak role of context for the retrieval of olfactory memories established during foraging.

The main error, the omission of a 108 bp (base pairs) long sequence on the 3' end of the cDNA was caused by misalignment of overlapping parts of the sequenced fragments in the region containing repetitive sequences. The updated sequence of RJP57-1 cDNA is 1807 bp long and encodes a protein with 544 amino acid residues including the signal peptide. The protein shows sequence homology over 385 residues with the yellow protein of Drosophila melanogaster, which is involved in the process of melanin pigmentation of Drosophila cuticle. The RJP57-1 protein sequence possesses a 100 amino acid residues long repetitive region consisting of a 20-fold repeated sequence motif XQNXX on its C-terminal part The repetitive region is interesting because of the regular distribution of cationic amino acid residues (arginine/lysine) in the last 14 repeats and the non-regular distribution of 10 residues of anionic aspartic acid throughout the whole repetitive region. According to computer analyses, the region possesses a structure of regularly pleated peptide chain. The hydrophilic character of the repetitive region and the supposed specific structure indicate that it could form a distinct structural domain located on the protein surface.

The Y59 rats received i.m. 0.4 ml or i.v. 0.025 ml of RJ once or twice at 7 day intervals. Serum levels of total proteins and immunoglobulins in the rats that received RJ once or twice within a 2-week-period were significantly lower (P ≤ 0.05) as compared with the nontreated animals. In mice which were immunized with 4 x 108 of SRBC 7 days after the application of RJ the number of plaque forming splenocytes was significantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) than that in the controls. Both the weight of inguinal lymph node and the number of peripheral blood lymphocytes were increased (P ≤ 0.05) in RJ-treated mice 3 or 5 days after the immunization, respectively. Neutrophils were decreased (P ≤ 0.05) in the mice that were killed 5 or 10 days after the RJ treatment. Overall these results indicate that RJ exhibited immunomodulatory properties by stimulating antibody production and immunocompetent cell proliferation in mice or depressing humoral immune functions in rats. Both phenomena, though species-related in this model, could probably be reversed by changing the dose or the route of RJ application.","Immunomodulation; Mouse; Rat; Royal jelly",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343774064

Nectar-collecting honeybees did not contact reproductive parts of flowers. Pollen-collecting honeybees preferentially visited male-stage flowers but rarely visited female-stage flowers. Fruit set on caged inflorescences that allowed access to honeybees but excluded birds was reduced by more than 50% compared to inflorescences that were visited by both types of visitors. Further, fruit set on caged inflorescences was less than on bagged inflorescences that excluded both birds and honeybees, indicating that pollen removal by bees decreased opportunities for delayed autonomous selfing in the absence of birds. Although fruit set was not pollen-limited at the study site, pollen removal by honeybees would decrease fruit set in small populations where birds are scarce. In addition, pollen removal by honeybees would reduce opportunities for outerossing and reproductive success through male function.

Cohorts of 30-60 bees from each of ten resistant colonies and eight susceptible colonies were tested in eight trials (three to five colonies per stock per trial) having exposure durations of 4, 9 or 21 days. The principal results were that lower percentages of resistant bees than of susceptible bees routinely became infested by foundress mites, individual infested susceptible bees often had more foundress mites than individual infested resistant bees did and mite fecundity was similar in both host types.

Semiochemicals, the pheromones and allomones, have been detected in arthropod species in six orders, and it has been clearly established that these compounds are used with great parsimony. The versatility of these invertebrates in using these natural products for an incredible diversity of functions emphasizes the significance of semiochemicals in the evolutionary biology of the Arthropoda. Multifunctional pheromones have proved to be especially characteristic of the queens of eusocial species. Compounds such as the queen substance of the honey bee. Apis mellifera, possess unrelated primer and releaser functions for the workers and act as a sex attractant for drones. Females of other hymenopterous species exploit the secretions of sting-associated glands as sex pheromones, whereas a variety of nonhymenopterous species have adapted components in diverse defensive secretions to function as sex pheromones. The alarm pheromones of many arthropods are also used as defensive allomones, activity inhibitors, cryptic alarm pheromones, aggregative attractants, robbing agents, digging agents, trail pheromones, and antimicrobial agents. Defensive allomones also possess some of these parsimonious roles; in addition, however, some of these compounds possess highly distinctive roles, such as functioning as lethal attractants for prey or, in the aquatic milieu, cuticular wetting agents. Clearly, the availability of a variety of pheromones and allomones has enabled arthropods to evolve an elegant semiochemical parsimony with which to exploit the biological milieu.","Alarm pheromonal parsimony; Allomones; Antimicrobial defense allomones; Multifunctional sex pheromones; Pheromones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030061242

Through a microscope, we videotaped this mite's movement on young bees, dead bees and bees exposed to vegetable oil. Previous studies have shown that solid vegetable oil decreases mite infestations in a bee colony. We hypothesized that the oil alters mite behaviour to the detriment of the parasite, thus helping to safeguard the host. Habitat-seeking behaviour, identified as necessary for mites to locate a new host environment, was disrupted on both dead and oil-treated bees. Questing behaviour, which is associated with transfer between hosts, increased significantly on the dead and oily bees. The behaviours of mites were significantly different between all three treatments (x2 = 494.96, p &lt; 0.001 on dead bees and x2 = 851.11, p &lt; 0.001 on oily bees). Both questing and seeking behaviours were significantly different on each of the thoracic treatments (F2,66 = 7.88, p &lt; 0.001 and F2,66 = 21.28, p&lt; 0.001) and mite questing behaviour was not altered between males and females on live or oily bees (F1,22 = 0.25, p &lt; 0.62), but habitat seeking was (f1,22 = 7.42, p &lt; 0.012). The male questing and habitat-seeking behaviours were observed. We conclude that oil-treated bees gained protection from habitat-seeking mites because the normal behaviour of the mites seeking an oviposition site is interrupted. © 1996 Chapman &amp; Hall.","Acarapis woodi; Apis mellifera; Honey bees; Tracheal mites; Vegetable oil",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030462347

Additionally hand-pollination (self- and cross-pollination) has been performed in the greenhouse. Flower longevity was high, close to 24 d in greenhouse conditions; nectar secretion was scarce with a daily mean volume of 0.25μl and 0.03 mg of sugar. Apis mellifera Anthidium sp., Andrena, sp. and Lysandra sp. have been captured visiting the flowers of E. andevalensis. Mean number of ovules per flower was high, ca. 77, and was statistically independent of population, individual plant and inflorescence. The mean average fertility (74%) also varied at these three levels. Fruit and seed set in natural populations were high, with values ca 87% for fruiting; in the field the mean number of seeds per fruit was close to 57. The exclusion of insects (i.e. pollinators) in the field lowered very signigicantly fruit- and seed-set, while in the greenhouse absolutely no fruit or seed has occurred spontaneously. Hand-pollination experiments produced significantly lower rates of seeds/fruit compared to plants in the field, but there was no effect of cross- versus self-pollination. Erica andevalensis is therefore a self-compatible not-selfing species. From a conservation point of view, this species is in a ""good reproductive health"", it produces high numbers of fruit and seed set under natural conditions. Therefore, no intrinsic reproductive threat is apparent. Nevertheless, the fidelity to its environment appears to be sharply endangering the future of this remarkable heather.","Breeding system; Conservation biology; Flower biology; Fruit and seed set; Pollination; South Spain",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030434227

Longer lived bees in the fall and winter harbored mites that reproduced for a longer period than did mites in bees during spring and summer. Oviposition rate was relatively uniform at ≈0.85 eggs per female per day during the initial 16 d of adult bee life regardless of season. In all seasons, peak mite populations occurred in bees ≈24 d old, with egg laying declining rapidly beyond day 24 in spring and summer bees but more slowly in fall and winter bees. Stadial lengths of eggs and male and female larvae were 5, 4, and 5 d, respectively. Sex ratio ranged from 1.15:1 to 2.01:1, female bias, but because males are not known to migrate they would have been overestimated in the sampling scheme. Fecundity was estimated to be ≈21 offspring. assuming daughter mites laid limited eggs in tracheae before dispersal.

However, a critical review of this 'energy hypothesis' reveals many inconsistencies in the experiments from which it was derived. In fact, new evidence shows that the energy hypothesis cannot be correct. Foragers loaded with weights do not overestimate distance, as indicated by their waggle dances performed upon return to the hive. Bees that climb to a feeder on top of a high building (50 m) signal the same distance as hive mates that visit an equidistant feeder at ground level. Foragers visiting a feeder suspended from a balloon at 70 m from their hive underestimate the distance flown dramatically when the balloon lifts the feeder from ground level to 90m, even though the energy required to reach the feeder increases considerably. Foragers from a hive situated on a high building (50 m) that fly to a feeder on the roof of another high building (34 m) signal a much shorter distance than the actual distance flown. We propose instead an 'Optical flow hypothesis': bees use the speed of retinal image motion perceived from the ground to estimate the distance flown. Flight altitude is important for distance estimation by retinal image flow, because objects move faster and farther across the retina when the bee flies closer to the ground. When the forager's flight behavior is considered, the optical flow hypothesis does not conflict with previous findings.","Apis mellifera; Dances; Distance estimation; Energy hypothesis; Foraging; Honeybee; Optical flow",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000878057

Elucidating the role of juvenile hormone during behavioral development in adult honey bees provides an opportunity to study hormone regulation of nervous system structure and function in an insect with a rich behavioral repertoire and social life. A worker honey bee typically lives 30–60 days. During this time, she performs a sequence of different tasks that sustain the colony. A striking behavioral transition typically occurs at about 3 weeks of age. At this time, worker bees stop performing within-hive tasks such as rearing brood and building comb and begin to forage outside the hive. This behavioral development is accompanied by a marked increase in the production of juvenile hormone. The mushroom bodies of the protocerebrum, the region of the insect brain most often associated with learning and memory, also undergo an internal reorganization during behavioral development. High titers of juvenile hormone and an increased volume of neuropil associated with the mushroom bodies are characteristic of the forager. Importantly, the time of the behavioral transition to foraging is not fixed. Individual bees can respond to changing colony or environmental conditions by accelerating or delaying the switch from within-hive tasks to foraging. For example, in the absence of older workers, some bees will undergo precocious development and may forage as early as 4 days of age. These workers also experience a precocious rise in juvenile hormone and an earlier reorganization of the mushroom bodies. Our current studies investigate the roles played by juvenile hormone and experience in shaping the mushroom bodies of the adult honey bee, and the relationship of these changes to the bee's ability to forage successfully. It is proposed that juvenile hormone may mediate neural plasticity in the brains of adult honey bees to support the demanding cognitive task of foraging. © 1996 S.

The acaricide was administered either as a small piece of plastic strip (Apistan®, Apivar®), or by impregnation of a piece of Whatmann paper no 3 with a known quantity of acaricide. The strip was stuck on the bottom of a Petri dish covered with a net. Five bees were put in contact with the acaricide for 2 hours (fig 1). After that, five mites were introduced onto the bees.

According to the different varroa strains, the lethal time varied from 6-1218 rain with fluvalinate. The highest lethal times were registered from mites coming from apiaries where treatments with Apistan® were ineffective (table 1).

In all studies in which capitula were prevented from crossing, only one plant had a high level of achene production, all others producing either a few achenes or none at all. Achene production in plants allowed to cross was high and significantly greater than in plants prevented from crossing. Persistent low levels of self-fertilization in most plants indicated that there was selection against inbreeding.

One hypothesis is that the attractiveness of a color or odor is based on the strength of its association with the taste of sucrose, which increases with the duration of concurrent color-taste or odor-taste stimulation. Another hypothesis is that the attractiveness of a color or odor is based on association with the afferent consequences of feeding, which are different for the two amounts. Both hypotheses were tested in experiments on proboscis-extension conditioning, a technique that provides better control of stimulation than is possible in work with free-flying foragers. In Experiments 1-3, which were designed to test the first hypothesis, an odor that accompanied the ingestion of sucrose on training trials was found to elicit extension of the proboscis when subsequently it was presented alone, but the duration of concurrent stimulation had no significant effect on the probability or persistence of the response. In Experiments 4 and 5, which were designed to test the second hypothesis, an odor that immediately followed the ingestion of sucrose on training trials failed to elicit extension of the proboscis when subsequently it was presented alone.

Pollen density on bees collected from 'Mauritius' inflorescences was very low during the M1 bloom and increased to very high values during the M2 bloom. These results indicate that the 'Mauritius' M1 bloom does not play an important role as a source of pollen for pollination. Pronounced, significant, and consistent differences in nectar volume per flower and sugar concentration in the nectar were found between M1. M,. and female (F) 'Mauritius' flowers. Values were very high in F flowers, medium in M2 flowers, and low in M1 flowers. Accordingly, the density of bees found on inflorescences was high during the F bloom, intermediate during the M2 bloom, and low during the M1 bloom. The positive correlation between bee density and sugar concentration in the nectar was highly significant for M2 and F 'Mauritius' flowers.

The gC signal sequence was substituted with the honeybee melittin signal sequence and the transmembrane region was replaced with a histidine tag. The recombinant virus produced high levels of gC in both the cells and supernatants of infected cells. The protein was present by 24 h and maximal secretion occurred at 96 h post-infection. The recombinant protein was antigenically authentic as shown by its reaction with each of a panel of individual monoclonal antibodies specific for the five distinct antigenic sites on EHV-1 gC. Recombinant gC was purified from the supernatant of infected cells by immune-affinity chromatography and-used to immunize C3H (H-2K(k) haplotype) mice. This incurred a gC specific antibody response against both the recombinant protein and EHV-1 gC. 'Pepscan' analysis showed that the gC specific antibodies in serum from these mice reacted with the same epitopes on gC as those recognized by antibodies in convalescent equine sera (i.e. antibodies were specific to antigenic sites one and five). A third previously unrecognized antibody binding site at the carboxyl terminus was also detected (Antibody binding domain I). A T-cell proliferative response against EHV-1 was detected in splenocyte populations taken from vaccinated mice. Further, the recovery of virus from the lungs and turbinates following challenge of mice with EHV-1 was significantly reduced.

The hypothesis that antibodies to whole bee venom and bee venom components could neutralize the lethal effect of bee venom was tested. Antibodies from beekeepers and immunized rabbits were incubated with bee venom and neutralization was studied by survival of intravenously injected mice. Beekeeper serum antibodies were found effective in protecting mice challenged with whole venom, and serum from rabbits immunized with phospholipase A2 (PLA2) was effective in protection against lethal effects of PLA2. Serum antibodies from rabbits immunized with whole venom or melittin were ineffective in neutralizing whole venom in vivo and had low titers in a venom enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results suggest the need for development of more effective methods for raising antitoxic antibodies to bee venom components in other animals as a means of developing an antiserum that would be effective for treatment of human victims of multiple bee stings.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029756591

However, several bee species have adopted nocturnal activity, taking advantage of the benefits of night foraging. By measuring behavioural visual performance in honeybees, we show that insects can possess better spatial resolution in dim light than the optics and physiology of their apposition eyes suggest, implying the presence of higher neural mechanisms which enhance vision at night. Theoretical calculations reveal that honeybees improve light capture at night by neurally summing photons in space and time. Even though summation compromises both spatial and temporal resolution, the improved photon capture enhances vision sufficiently for bees to discriminate coarse images in moonlight. This explains how bees and many other insects can adopt a nocturnal lifestyle despite having an eye design typical of a day-active insect.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029799572

Previous studies have shown that juvenile hormone (JH) mediates this behavioral plasticity, and that worker-worker interactions influence both JH titers and age at first foraging. These results also indicated that the age at first foraging is delayed in the presence of foragers, suggesting that colony age demography directly influences temporal division of labor. We tested this hypothesis by determining whether behavioral or physiological development can be accelerated, delayed, or reversed by altering colony age structure. In three out of three trials, earlier onset of foraging was induced in colonies depleted of foragers compared to colonies depleted of an equal number of bees across all age classes. In two out of three trials, delayed onset of foraging was induced in colonies in which foragers were confined compared to colonies with free-flying foragers. Finally, in three out of three trials, both endocrine and exocrine changes associated with reversion from foraging to brood care were induced in colonies composed of all old bees and devoid of brood; JH titers decreased and hypopharyngeal glands regenerated. These results demonstrate that plasticity in age-related division of labor in honey bee colonies is at least partially controlled by social factors. The implications of these results are discussed for the recently developed 'activator-inhibitor' model for honey bee behavioral development.","Age demography; Behavioral development; Behavioral plasticity; Juvenile hormone; Temporal polyethism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029862202

It was shown that gene flow by pollen resulting in nut set takes place most strongly between neighbouring sides of adjacent cross- compatible pairs of trees. Examination of pellets extracted from pollen traps fitted to hives for the isozyme markers showed that most of the pellets were composed of pollen from only one cultivar or another, in accord with the hypothesis that the honeybee predominantly visits only one cultivar, either single trees or along rows of one cultivar, and that cross-pollination results from accidental or rare visits involving two cultivars.

Several identified serotonin-immunoreactive neurons are present in the three neuromeres of the suboesophageal ganglion, the dorsal protocerebrum, and the deutocerebrum at pupal ecdysis. Further immunoreactive neurons are incorporated into the developing pupal brain in two characteristic developmental phases. During the first phase, 5 days after pupal ecdysis, serotonin immunoreactivity is formed in the protocerebral central body, the lamina and lobula, and the deutocerebral antennal lobe. During the second phase, 2 days later, immunoreactivity appears in neurons of the protocerebral noduli of the central complex, the medulla, and the pedunculi and robes of the mushroom bodies. Three novel serotonin-immunoreactive neurons that innervate the central complex and the mushroom bodies can be individually identified.","Antennal lobe; Apis mellifera; Deutocerebral giant cell (DCG); Insect nervous system; Serial homologue neurons; Transmitter",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030477346

An important criterion for deciding between these two hypotheses is the generalization of a learned pattern to other patterns. We therefore trained bees to patterns presented on a vertical screen and to discriminate between either a black triangle and a ring-pattern (training A, B), or a black disc and an outline triangle (training C), and then tested for a possible generalization of the learned patterns to a variety of other patterns. Several results obtained that way (e.g. the transfer test, column 2 in Fig. 1a, or Fig. 3) seem to indicate that the bees indeed do generalize a learned pattern to other patterns, and hence appear to support the parameter-hypothesis. Quite unexpectedly, however, it turned out that the same results can also be explained by a template matching mechanism. In simulating an image matching strategy we used a similarity function that had been successfully applied to pattern discrimination data obtained in tetheredly flying fruitflies, Drosophila. This similarity function assumes that the insect evaluates the ratio between the overlap of an actual retinal image with the stored template and the total area of the actual retinal image (see Fig. 5). It is able to describe the bulk of our data. Interestingly, the training situation appears to have an influence on the weight attributed by the bee to different parts of the template. Such a situation-dependent weighting might indicate a first stage of parameter extraction.","Eidetic images; Generalization; Honeybees; Retinotopic templates; Visual pattern recognition",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000959523

Since then, diminished efficacy with available pyrethroid treatments has been encountered in many regions of Italy. The aim of this study was to investigate the type of resistance in V. jacobsoni to the pyrethroid tau- fluvalinate by focusing on metabolic resistance mechanisms (detoxication). After developing a suitable application method, two synergists were used: piperonyl butoxide (PBO), as an inhibitor of the microsomal monooxygenases of the cytochrome P450 complex and S,S,S-tributylphosphorotrithioate (DEF), which blocks esterases. A significant decrease in the LC50 values of the susceptible and of the resistant mite strains after the application of PBO was observed. A slight decrease of the LC50 values was also observed after the application of DEE. However, this decrease was not significant. These results indicate that the resistance of Varroa mites to tau- fluvalinate can partly be explained by an increased detoxication due to the monooxygenases in the P450 system, which is blocked by PBO. Esterases seems to play a negligible role. Whether glutathione-S-transferases are involved, is still unknown, but other mechanisms, such as the modification of the binding sites and/or reduced uptake might be involved as well.","detoxication; resistance; resistance mechanism; tau-fluvalinate; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029817908

The alkaline and acid forms extracted from the guts of worker bees exhibited substrate-inhibition features. Upon detailed kinetic analysis, cupric organic salts indicate activation effects at concentrations of about 1 mM. Concentrations up to 10 mM (alkaline form) and 25 mM (acid form) induced no important changes, except a partial quenching of the substrate-inhibition process, characterized by a wide increase in the constant of apparent inhibitory binding of substrate to the enzyme-substrate complex. Partial purification gave a single alkaline form with quite similar kinetic behavior in the absence of natural ions as in crude extracts. Cupric gluconate and sulfate demonstrated similar patterns, except an increase of the apparent Hill coefficient by sulfate only. The substrate constant of acid phosphatases was decreased at high cupric gluconate doses while its maximum velocity was biphasically increased (with observed maximum at 1 mM), resulting in a sustained activation. Chemiluminescence studies revealed that cupric ion activation is counteracted by oxygen radicals generated by cupric ions and also, in vitro, by the artificial substrate para-nitrophenylphosphate. The para-nitrophenol molecules released from the reaction are therefore responsible for biphasic effects selectively observed with gluconate salts. In apicultural practice, neither blockade of activity nor dramatic changes are to be expected at doses administered to bees against the parasite.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030272166

Ten strains of Australian commercial honey bee were evaluated for hygienic behaviour. Dead pupae were inserted into the colonies and checked after 3, 5 and 7 days for the number of pupae removed. Most colonies (80%) were non-hygienic and hence likely to be susceptible to chalkbrood. However, 2 strains provided good overall performance in the test and comprised 1 or 2 colonies that were highly hygienic. Colonies were evaluated 3 times, and the good performance of these colonies was repeatable across trials.

Allen Rd., Tucson, AZ 85719, United States","Peroxisomes are ubiquitous organelles that contain catalase (CAT) and an array of inducible enzymes that regulate aspects of lipid, purine, xenobiotic, eicosanoid, and phospholipid metabolism. Although peroxisomes are recognized as essential components in the cellular economy of microorganisms, plants, and mammals, little is known about their specialized functions in insect metabolism. Peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) is a flavin-linked, H2O2-producing enzyme that regulates the β-oxidation of long chain fatty acids. We measured ACO and CAT activity in midgut tissues from worker honey bees, Apis mellifera, of known ages from free-flying colonies. The ACO activity peaked in young worker bees that digest and assimilate nutrients from pollen and from trophallaxis. As the bees aged, ACO activity declined. Conversely, CAT activity increased as the bees aged and reached its highest level in the oldest bees that were assayed. Isolated honey bee midguts were then fractionated using sucrose and Metrizamide (MET) density gradient centrifugation. Organelle-bound CAT activity equilibrated in sucrose at densities between 1.19 and 1.22, which are typical of spherical 1 μm peroxisomes. In the MET gradients, the organelle-bound CAT separated into two distinct fractions. The heavier fraction equilibrated at 1.21 and the lighter fraction at 1.15, a density commonly associated with microperoxisomes. These results support our ultrastructural and cytochemical data and suggest that the diverse functions of regionally specialized midgut epithelial cells lead to a heterogeneous population of peroxisomal organelles. ACO activity confirms the role of midgut peroxisomes in the intermediary metabolism of lipids and the increasing CAT activity suggests that the midgut epithelium may metabolize deleterious pro-oxidants of aerobic metabolism associated with foraging and senescence. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0008535613

In a preliminary trial (table II) the effectiveness of either pure or diluted (1:5) oils was assessed by the diffusion agar method (Carta et al, 1989). The more effective ones were then tested in nutrient broth, at doses ranging from 50-400 mg/kg, to determine the minimal bactericide and sporicide concentrations. The most significant results were obtained with the oils of Citrus sinensis, Cinnamomun sp, Cuminum cyminum, Eugenia spp, Thymus vulgaris and reconstituted oil of Verbena (tables III and IV, fig 1). The same oils proved to be non-toxic for adult honeybees at the dose of 400 mg/kg. Cinnamomun oil was the most effective, with minimal bactericide and sporicide concentrations of 50 and 100 mg/kg respectively. This oil also gave positive results in controlling the American foulbrood in field trials, particularly in autumn and winter, when administered in semi-solid food (honey + caster sugar, 1:1.5) at a concentration of 400 mg/kg. In particular, the action of Cinnamomun oil on disease growth was evaluated in two distinct trials using four and five nuclei, respectively, obtained from the same colony (Apis mellifera ligustica Spin) so that each of them contained an approximately equal amount of adult bees, brood, honey and pollen beside a young queen (Liendenfelser, 1968). In both experimental trials, the worker brood was also carefully examined periodically by laboratory tests (Lloyd, 1986). The results showed that during autumn and winter, when the bees' consumption of the extra food is favoured by the environmental conditions (weather, scarcity or absence of flowers), Cinnamomun oil acts in vivo on B larvae. However, its use in the control of American foulbrood poses several practical problems including the time and the method of administration to take full advantage of the bactericidal properties found in vitro. If essential oils can be used against American foulbrood, the toxicological risks and the establishment of undesirable resistance factors associated with use of chemicals would be avoided.","American foulbrood control; antimicrobial action; Bacillus larvae; essential oil",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029823708

In a general population cohort, we determined the prevalence of SAR and HV-specific IgE antibodies and assessed parameters associated with the latter. A total of 277 voluntarily participating inhabitants of rural Bavaria (Germany) (232 adults, mean age 38.0 years; 45 children, mean age 8.4 years) were investigated for a history of atopic disease or SAR to insect stings; in 258 of these, total IgE and specific IgE antibodies to HV (Apis mellifera, Vespula vulgaris/germanica) and four common aeroallergens (birch pollen, grass pollen, house-dust mite, and cat dander) in the serum were determined. Nine (3.3%) subjects reported SAR to insect stings. In 27.1% of the sera, specific IgE antibodies to HV were found, to bee venom in 24.8%, and to wasp venom in 8.5% (P<0.0001). Of those exhibiting HV- specific IgE, 7.1% reported SAR to insect stings. A personal history of atopic disease (hay fever, asthma, or atopic eczema) was present in 16.7%, specific IgE to common aeroallergens was found in 32.6%, and total IgE > 100 kU/l was found in 22.5%. Specific serum IgE to HV was significantly associated with male sex (female vs. male, OR=0.47; CI 0.25-0.86), young age (children vs. adults, OR=2.80; CI 1.25-6.28), a history of SAR to insect stings (OR = 4.16; CI 1.15- 15.03), total sIgE > 100 kU/l (OR=3.88; CI 1.98-7.60), and specific IgE antibodies to three of the four aeroallergens (grass pollen, OR=7.24 CI 3.66- 14.38; birch pollen, OR=3.67 CI 1.54-8.81; and house-dust mite, OR=4.61 CI 2.08-10.32). It is concluded that immunologic sensitization to HV is common in the general population and is associated with atopy-related humoral IgE hyperresponsiveness.","aeroallergens; atopy; Hymenoptera venom allergy; insect stings; specific IgE antibodies",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029811342
