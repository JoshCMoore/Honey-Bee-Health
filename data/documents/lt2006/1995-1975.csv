We selected for the amount of pollen stored in combs of honey bee colonies, a colony-level trait, and then used random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers and interval mapping procedures with data from backcross colonies to identify two quantitative trait loci (pln1 and pln2, LOD 3.1 and 2.3, respectively). Quantitative trait loci effects were confirmed in a separate cross by demonstrating the cosegregation of marker alleles with the foraging behavior of individual workers. Both pln1 and pln2 had an effect on the amount of pollen carried by foragers returning to the colony, as inferred by the association between linked RAPD marker alleles, D8-3f and 301-55, and the individual pollen load weights of returning foragers. The alleles of the two marker loci were nonrandomly distributed with respect to foraging task. The two loci appeared to have different effects on foraging behavior. Individuals with alternative alleles for the marker linked to pln2 (but not pln1) differed with respect to the nectar sugar concentration of their nectar loads.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028803310

During grooming, the receiving bees held their wings perpendicular to the body axis. Groomer bees most often cleaned those body parts which could not be reached during self-cleaning by receiving bees. During 18% of the grooming time, groomer bees cleaned their own mouth parts and antennae. The grooming behavior removed dust and pollen from the wing bases and petiolus and realigned the body hairs.

Fluvalinate (Apistan®) has been one of the most widely used acaricides since 1989. In 1992, 1993 and 1994, ineffective treatments were observed in Italy and then France, and the hypothesis of a resistance was put forward. The therapeutic efficacy of fluvalinate was estimated in experiments performed in 1992, 1993 and 1994. Groups of colonies from different areas were thus treated for 32-34 d with 2 strips placed in contact with the cluster. Mite mortality was checked with fatted detector boards on hive bottom boards. A treatment with amitraz (Anti-Varroa Schering®) to determine the residual infestation of adult bees was performed the day following the strip withdrawal. Brood infestation was checked by examination of 100 capped cells, by entire brood hatching in an incubator, and by counting the mites on emerging bees. The results showed a decrease in efficacy in the Italian colonies in which fluvalinate therapeutic efficacy fell to 29.7% in 1994. The dosage of fluvalinate in the strips before and after treatment and their good positioning with regard to the bees did not allow us to incriminate a misuse of Apistan® strips. In France, the therapeutic efficacy will be examined at the Italian border during an investigation of all apiaries. © 1995.","Apis mellifera; Apis mellifica; efficacité; efficacy; fluvalinate; résistance; resistance; Varroa disease; varroose",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029505119

Between July 1990 and October 1992, samples and data were collected monthly from 26 beehives untreated for parasites. The colonies were located in 9 apiaries in 3 areas with different climates (fig 1). The development of the mite population was measured by determining the infestation rate of Varroa mite in adult bee, in brood cells and the mortality per month. In the 3 different climatic areas studied: mediterranean, continental and oceanic (MCO), continental mediterranean (CM) and mediterranean subtropical (MS), the mean infestation rates were 9.9, 4.1 and 6.1 mites per 100 adult bees, respectively. The mean number of mites per 100 brood cells was 34.2, 17.8, and 24.8. The overall mean of mite infestation in the study was 8.2 mites per 100 bees, ie 29.5 mites per 100 brood cells (table I). Monthly differences in maximal infestation were observed in the areas studied (fig 2). In these areas V jacobsoni speeds up its biological cycle compared with the descriptions reported by other authors in continental Europe. V jacobsoni reaches its infective maxima earlier in the sampling stations with colder climates (CM) than in those with hotter climates (CMO). The results of our study confirm the observation of Woyke (1987) that V jacobsoni stays longer in sealed cells when climates are colder. The parasitic mite thus completes more reproductive cycles in the same period of time, speeds up the population growth. Milder climates favour global infestation rates to be higher in hotter areas (CMO). This totally different behaviour can be observed on the mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula (MS). The effects of the climate in this area, together with the occurrence of efflorescence (autochtonic, from subtropical cultivations or from greenhouse cultivations) throughout the year, cause fast development of the parasitic mite leading to the death of honeybee colonies within a few months. Our study shows that the phenology and climate conditions of a region are 2 main factors which affect and modify V jacobsoni population dynamics. © 1995.","Apis mellifera iberical; climate; dynamic population; Spain; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029188065

During the stay inside the hive thoracic surface temperature ranged from 31.4 to 43.9 °C. In both round and wagtail dancing honeybees the concentration of sucrose in the food influenced dancing temperature in a non-linear way. Average dancing temperature was 37.9 °C in foragers gathering a 0.5 mol·l-1 sucrose solution, 40.1°C with a 1 mol·l-1, 40.6°C with a 1.5 mol·l-1 and 40.7°C with a 2 mol·l-1 solution. The variability of thoracic temperature was highest with the 0.5 mol·l-1 and lowest with the 1.5 and 2 mol·l-1 concentrations. Thoracic temperatures during trophallactic contact with hive bees were similar to dancing temperature at 1.5 mol·l-1 but lower at the other concentrations. During periods of distribution of food to hive bees (trophallactic contact &gt;2.5s) the dancers' thorax cooled down by more than 0.5°C considerably more frequently with the 0.5 mol·l-1 solution (65% of cases) than with the 1.5 mol·l-1 solution (26%). By contrast, heating the thorax up by more than 0.5°C was infrequent with the 0.5 mol·l-1 solution (2%) but occurred at a maximum rate of 26% with the 1.5 mol·l-1 solution. Bees gathering the 1 or 2 mol·l-1 solutions showed intermediate behavior. Linear model analysis showed that at higher concentrations the dancers compensated better for variations of hive air temperature: per 1 °C increase of hive temperature dancing temperature increased by 0.34, 0.22, 0.12, and 0.13 °C with 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 mol·l-1 sucrose solutions, respectively. The results furnish evidence that dancing honeybees follow a strategy of ""selective heterothermy"" by tuning their thermal behavior to the needs of the behavior performed at the moment. Thoracic temperature is regulated to a high level and more accurately when fast exploitation of profitable food sources is recommended. Thoracic temperature is lowered when the ratio of gain to costs of foraging becomes more unfavorable. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","Dancing; Honeybee, Apis mellifera; Thermal behavior; Thermography; Thermoregulation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029201358

The bees were suspended from a two-component aerodynamic balance at different, near optimum body angle of attack α and were allowed to choose their own speed: their body mass and body weight was determined before and after a flight; their speed, lift, wingbeat frequency and total flight time were measured throughout a flight. These values were used to determine thrust, resultant aerodynamic force (magnitude and tilting angle), Reynolds number, total flight distance and total flight impulse. Flights in which lift was ≥ body weight were mostly obtained. Bees, flown to complete exhausion, were refed with 5, 10, 15 or 20 μl of a 1.28-mol·l-1 glucose solution (energy content w=18.5, 37.0, 55.5 or 74.0 J) and again flown to complete exhaustion at an ambient temperature of 25±1.5°C by a flight of known duration such that the calculation of absolute and relative metabolic power was possible. Mean body mass after exhaustion was 76.49±3.52 mg. During long term flights of 7.47-31.30 min similar changes in flight velocity, lift, thrust, aerodynamic force, wingbeat frequency and tilting angle took place, independent of the volume of feeding solution. After increasing rapidly within 15 s a more or less steady phase of 60-80% of total flight time, showing only a slight decrease, was followed by a steeper, more irregular decrease, finally reaching 0 within 20-30 s. In steady phases lift was nearly equal to resultant aerodynamic force; tilting angle was 79.8±4.0°, thrust to lift radio did not vary, thrust was 18.0±7.4% of lift, lift was somewhat higher/equal/lower than body mass in 61.3%, 16.1%, 22.6% of all totally analysable flights (n=31). The following parameters were varied as functions of volume of feeding solution (5-20 μl in steps of 5 μl) and energy content. (18.5-74.0 J in steps of 18.5 J): total flight time, velocity, total flight distance, mean lift, thrust, mean resultant aerodynamic force, tilting angle, total flight impulse, wingbeat frequency, metabolic power and metabolic power related to body mass, the latter related to ""empty"", ""full"" and ""mean"" (=100 mg) body mass.

Male flowers differ from female ones in having a stunted style (style in female exserted from corolla and deeply bifurcating) and anthers filled with fertile pollen (anthers in the female lacking pollen). The size of the corolla and number of florets per head were similar between male and female flowers. The crown area of this arboreal species was also similar in male and female plants. The sex ratio was 0.55 male, not significantly different from 0.5. Both sexes produced nectar of similar sugar concentration (ca. 50%). The flowers are pollinated by feral honeybees (Apis mellifera), but they are thought to have been pollinated by small, lesshairy, endemic solitary bees before honeybees were introduced and subsequently became the dominant bee species on the island. The evolution of dioecy of Dendrocacalia on the island is thought to stem from the deleterious effects of inbreeding that are inherent in plants with geitonogamy. The increased geitonogamy on the island has resulted from increased woodiness (i.e., increased number of flowers per plant) and the original dependence on endemic bee pollinators, which are now endangered. © 1995 Botanical Society of Japan.","Bonin Islands; Compositae; Dendrocacalia; Dioecy; Feral honeybee",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-21344456667

Data analysis and structure calculation followed conventional protocols inherent to DIANA and related programs with two exceptions. First, distance constraints were obtained from two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser spectra by a previously described partial relaxation matrix approach. Second, since the pairing pattern of the six cysteine residues was not established a priori, the unequivocal assignment of the disulfide bridges was achieved exclusively from the n.m.r. data by a statistical analysis of preliminary DIANA structures. In the final calculation we used 227 upper distance constraints, 67 torsional constraints from vicinal coupling constants and ten stereospecific assignments of β-methylene protons. Scyllatoxin folds into a compact ellipsoidal shape. An α-helix (defined with 0.24 Å resolution) spanning 2.5 turns from Leu5 till Ser14 is stabilized by Cys8-Cys26 and Cys12-Cys28 disulfide bridges to the carboxy-terminal strand of an antiparallel β-sheet. The antiparallel β-sheet (defined at 0.66 Å resolution) extends from Leu18 to Val29 with a tight turn at Gly23-Asp24 and displays a right-handed twist. Scyllatoxin competes with the toxins apamin from Apis mellifera mellifera and P05 from Androctonus mauretanicus mauretanicus for the same or similar high conductance calcium-activated potassium channels.

The discrepancy between sperm count and microsatellite estimates of the number of matings in A. florea suggests that despite direct injection of semen into the spermatheacal duct, either A. florea drones inject only a small proportion of their semen, or queens are able to rapidly expel excess semen after mating. A model of sexual selection (first proposed by Koeniger and Koeniger) is discussed in which males attempt to gain reproductive dominance by increasing ejaculate volume and direct injection of spermatozoa into the spermatheca, while queens attempt to maintain polyandry by retaining only a small fraction of each male's ejaculate.

In the superfused retina, iodoacetate only at high concentration (3 mmol·1-1) causes a 77% decrease in the O2 consumption induced by a flash of light. Chromatographic analysis showed that 3 mmol·1-1 iodoacetate strongly inhibited glycolysis in the retinal glial cells and consequently suppressed the biosynthesis of alanine, which is the fuel transferred from the glia to the photoreceptors. However, the synthesis of 14C-alanine from [1-14C]-pyruvate was not affected by iodoacetate. It was therefore surprising to find that superfusion of the retina with 10 mmol·1-1 pyruvate had no protective effect on the decrease in O2 consumption, and that the 14CO2 production from [1-14C]-pyruvate was inhibited 60% by iodoacetate. Also, no protection from the effect of iodoacetate was obtained by adding 10 and 20 mmol·1-1 alanine in the superfusate, even though the transport of 14C-alanine in the photoreceptor cells was not significantly affected by 3 mmol·1-1 iodoacetate. However, exposure to iodoacetate strongly inhibited the production of 14C-glutamate from 14C-alanine. In contrast, the transformation of 14C-proline to 14C-glutamate was not affected by iodoacetate. Indeed, in the presence of iodoacetate, photostimulation caused a decrease in the total concentration of proline and glutamate. It appears therefore that 3 mmol·1-1 iodoacetate inhibits not only glycolysis and, consecutively, the formation of alanine, but also its use in the photoreceptors. Possibly a large intracellular store of proline, whose mitochondrial use was not affected, contributed in slowing down the inhibition of O2-consumption by iodoacetate. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","Alanine; Drone retina; Glycolysis; Iodoacetate; Photoreceptors",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028795707

While temporal variation in pollinator composition has been widely reported, spatial variability, particularly on a local scale, has been studied less frequently; nevertheless, available evidence suggests that local spatial variability may be a widespread feature of plant-pollinator interactions. In addition, the causes of this spatial variability are poorly known. This study was undertaken to quantify variability in the taxonomic composition of pollinators visiting local populations of black mustard, Brassica nigra, and to determine some of the causes of this variability. Simultaneous observations were conducted in seven pairs of black mustard populations. The members of each pair were in close spatial proximity but differed in number of plants. Larger plant populations were visited by significantly greater numbers of honey bees and significantly fewer small bees than small populations on a per-plant basis. There was also a trend toward greater syrphid fly visitation in small populations. The increased numbers of honey bees at large plant populations is probably due to their ability to recruit long distances to the most rewarding plant populations. The lower number of small bees at large plant populations may be due to competition from honey bees and/or spreading a constant number of small bees over the larger number of plants in large populations. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","Black mustard; Brassica nigra; Pollinator assemblage; Population size; Spatial variability",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028981294

The effects of anther position and other factors on pollen removal during single visits by all four pollinator taxa were measured.

For all pollinator taxa, pollen removal increased with the number of pollen grains available on a flower and whowed a positive, decelerating relationship with the duration of the visit. The effects of stigma position and other factors on pollen deposition during single visits by honey bees and butterflies were also studied. The nectar-feeding butterflies had a higher pollination efficiency (percentage of pollen grains removed from anthers that were subsequently deposited on a stigma) than the nectar- and pollen-feeding honey bees. Flowers with intermediate stigma exsertion had the highest numbers of pollen grains deposited on their stigmas by butterflies, but stigma exsertion had no effect on deposition by honey bees. For both butterflies and honey bees, pollen deposition on the recipient flower increased with the amount of pollen removed from the donor flower, and there was a positive, decelerating relationship between deposition and time spent at the flower; these results are analogous to those for pollen removal. The effects of anther and stigma exsertion on pollen removal and denosition did not fit predictions based on patterns of floral correlations, but results for morphology, pollen availability, time spent per visit, and pollinator efficiency are in broad agreement with previous studies, suggesting the possible emergence of some general rules of pollen transfer. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","Anther and stigma exsertion; Floral correlations; Floral morphology; Pollination efficiency; Raphanus raphanistrum",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028981299

Doses ranged from 0.24 to 16 nanomols per bee, and the effects were monitored over 4 hours on haemolymph carbohydrates and gut lipids. Glucose exhibited an early peaking over initial values, at 30 min followed by a decrease, but remained higher than control values at the times when maximum values occurred for each gluconate dose. However, the integrated glucose availability over the whole four hours was lowered at the lower dose and unchanged in the other cases. Lipids exhibited a decrease followed by a weakly or not significant increase at four hours, likely resulting from the wide variations of glucose levels acting as a cellular signaling. In conclusion, the mechanism of cupric gluconate action might involve a slight excess of glucose release at the lowest dose, while in practice little effects are to be expected on the energetic supply available to bees, which confirms previous observations on unaffected lethality in both laboratory and field trials.","cupric salts; dose and time-related effects; emerging worker bees; gut lipids; haemolymph glucose and trehalose",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029153946

Selective breeding produced high- and low-learning-performance lines of worker progeny that diverged from performance of workers whose fathers were selected at random. Furthermore, we show that levels of sucrose-induced sensitization are not correlated to learning performance. These results corroborate earlier findings and further demonstrate the power of selection on a haploid (drone) genotype. In addition, this study now shows that the demonstrated differences in learning performance cannot be completely accounted for by alteration of sucrose-induced sensitization.

We analyzed the effects of worker genotypic diversity on the phenotypes of honey bee colonies during a critical phase of colony development, the ""nest initiation"" phase. Five groups of colonies were studied (n = 5-11 per group); four groups had relatively low genotypic diversity compared to the fifth group. Colonies were derived from queens that were instrumentally inseminated with the semen of four different drones according to one of the following mating schemes: group A, 4 A-source drones; group B, 4 B-source drones; group C, 4 C-source drones; group D, 4 D-source drones; and group E, 1 drone of each of the A-D drone sources. There were significant differences between colonies in groups A-D for 8 out of 19 colony traits. Because the queens in all of these colonies were super sisters, the observed differences between groups were primarily a consequence of differences in worker genotypes. There were very few differences (2 out of 19 traits) between colonies with high worker genotypic diversity (group E) and those with low diversity (groups A-D combined). This is because colonies with greater diversity tended to have phenotypes that were average relative to colonies with low genotypic diversity. We hypothesize that the averaging effect of genotypic variability on colony phenotypes may have selective advantages, making colonies less likely to ""fail"" because of inappropriate colony responses to changing environmental conditions. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","Behavioral genetics; Colony fitness; Genotypic diversity; Polyandry; Social insects",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028979379

Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a major mediator for transient changes in these second messengers. The objective of this study was to examine the role of PKA in the central processing of chemosensory information by the honeybee. Effects of chemosensory stimulation in vivo were detected in the first chemosensory neuropil of the honeybee brain, the antennal lobe (AL), by using a combination of shock freezing and specific determination of PKA activity. Mechanosensory or odor stimulation of the antennae had no effect on PKA activity. Brief application of aqueous solutions (pure water or sucrose solution) to an antenna caused a rapid and transient elevation of PKA activity in the ipsilateral AL. A series of such stimuli led to a graded increase in PKA activity followed by a rapid decrease during the first 10 s after the end of stimulation, but elevated levels of PKA activity were observed for as long as 1 min. These results suggest that PKA activity and its regulation contribute to central processing of chemosensory signals. © 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

A simple model using clonal population growth as a fitness measure has been developed to study the circumstances under which specialization on drone brood would be a better strategy than reproduction in both types of cell. For European Apis mellifera, the model suggests that if mites have to wait less than 7 days on average before they can invade a drone cell, specialization on drone brood would be a better strategy. This is close to the estimated waiting time of 6 days. Hence, small differences in reproductive success in drone and worker cells and in the rate of mortality may determine whether specialization on drone brood will be promoted or not. In European A. mellifera colonies, Varroa mites invade both drone and worker cells, but specialization on drone brood cells seems to occur to some extent because drone cells are more frequently invaded than worker cells. In the parasite-host association of V. jacobsoni with African or Africanized A. mellifera or with A. cerana, the mites also invade both drone and worker cells, but the mites specialize on drone brood for reproduction since a large percentage of the mites in worker brood do not reproduce. Only in the parasite-host association of Euvarroa sinhai, a mite closely resembling V. jacobsoni, and A. forea is specialization complete, because these mites only invade drone brood. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Optimization model; Reproductive strategy; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028975374

The shift from nest taks to foraging has been especially well characterized; foraging is associated with high juvenile hormone titers and high rates of juvenile hormone biosynthesis, and can be induced prematurely in young bees by juvenile hormone treatment or by a shortage of foragers. However, very few studies have been conducted that study plasticity in division of labor under naturally occurring changes in the environment. To gain further insight into how the environment and juvenile hormone influence foraging behavior, we measured juvenile hormone titers and rates of biosynthesis in workers during times of the year when colony activity in temperate climates is reduced: late fall, winter, and early spring. Juvenile hormone titers and rates of biosynthesis decreased in foragers in the fall as foraging diminished and bees became less active. This demonstration of a natural drop in juvenile hormone confirms and extends previous findings when bees were experimentally induced to revert from foraging to within-hive tasks. In addition, endocrine changes in foragers in the fall are part of a larger seasonally related phenomenon in which juvenile hormone levels in younger, pre-foraging bees also decline in the fall and then increase the following spring as colony activity increases. The seasonal decline in juvenile hormone in foragers was mimicked in summer by placing a honey bee colony in a cold room for 8 days. This suggests that seasonal changes in juvenile hormone are not related to photoperiod changes, but rather to changes in temperature and/or colony social structure that in turn influence endocrine and behavioral development. We also found that active foragers in the late winter and early spring had lower juvenile hormone levels than active foragers in late spring. In light of recent findings of a possible link between juvenile hormone and neuroanatomical plasticity in the bee brain, these results suggest that bees can forage with low juvenile hormone, after previous exposure to some threshold level of juvenile hormone leads to changes in brain structure. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","Corpora allata; Honey bee, Apis mellifera; Juvenile hormone; Seasonal variation; Social insects",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029104801

To develop a more precise model it would be necessary to follow the population growth beyond our experimental data. © 1995 Chapman &amp; Hall.","Apis mellifera; hive debris; Honey bees; population growth rates; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029477064

Strains differed in areas of stored pollen after a single generation of selection and, by the third generation, the high strain colonies stored an average 6 times more pollen than low strain colonies. Colony-level organizational components that potentially affect pollen stores were identified that varied genetically within and between these strains. Changes occurred in several of these components, in addition to changes in the selected trait. High strain colonies had a significantly higher proportion of foragers returning with loads of pollen, however, high and low strain colonies had equal total numbers of foragers Colony rates of intake of pollen and nectar were not independent. Selection resulted in an increase in the number of pollen collectors and a decrease in the number of nectar collectors in high strain colonies, while the reciprocal relationship occurred in the low strain. High and low strain colonies also demonstrated different diurnal foraging patterns as measured by the changing proportions of returning pollen foragers. High strain colonies of generation 3 contained significantly less brood than did low strain colonies, a consequence of a constraint on colony growth resulting from a fixed nest volume and large quantities of stored pollen.

This study tested this prediction using worker honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) foraging on inflorescences of Lavandula stoechas. Female flowers contained about twice the volume of nectar of male flowers. As one would predict, bees foraging for nectar only chose inflorescences with disproportionately more female flowers: time spent on the inflorescence was correlated with the number of female flowers, but not with the number of male flowers. Inflorescence size was inversely correlated with the number of female flowers, and could be used as a morphological cue by these bees. Also as predicted, workers foraging for both pollen and nectar chose inflorescences with relatively greater numbers of both male and female flowers: time spent on these inflorescences was correlated with the number of male flowers, but not with the number of females flowers. A morphological cue inversely associated with such inflorescences is the size of the bract display. Choice of flowers within inflorescences was also influenced predictably, but preferences appeared to be based upon corolla size rather than directly on sex phase. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Foraging preference; Lavandula stoechas; Nectar content; Pollen content",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028974208

Newly emerged adult bees were individually dosed with 2 × 105 N apis spores, caged together in groups of 50, and incubated at 33 °C. The longevity of each bee and number of N apis spores carried by each bee at the time of death were recorded. All bees dosed with N apis spores had significantly reduced longevity compared with the undosed control bees. Furthermore, there were no significant differences among the 3 stocks of bees in the degree of this reduction in longevity. However, dark and Carniolan bees survived better in cages than Italian bees, whether dosed or not. There were significant differences among the 3 stocks in the mean numbers of spores carried by each dosed bee at the time of death, with Italian bees carrying the highest spore loads, Carniolan bees the lowest, and dark bees carrying an intermediate number of spores.

The mechanism by which the fungicide prochloraz enhances the toxicity of the pyrethroid insecticide λ-cyhalothrin was investigated. In vitro incubations with honeybee midguts were used to study the metabolism of [14C]λ-cyhalothrin. The principal metabolite was identified as 4-hydroxy-3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol (4′-OH-3-PBAlc) with small amounts of 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBAc). Both are products of ester bond cleavage, but microsomal oxidation was implicated in the formation of 4′-OH-3-PBAlc. After treating midguts with prochloraz, metabolism was predominantly to 3-PBAc, with little formation of 4′-OH-3-PBAlc, strongly indicating an inhibition of microsomal monooxygenase activity. In vivo investigations showed the major metabolic products of [14C]λ-cyhalothrin extracted from frass of treated honeybees were 4′-OH-3-PBAlc, 2′-hydroxy-3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol, and 4′-hydroxy-3-phenoxybenzoic acid. However, when bees were simultaneously dosed with prochloraz, there was an absence of metabolites detected in the frass of bees for 16 hr post-treatment Thus, prochloraz delayed the metabolism, detoxication, and excretion of λ-cyhalothrin by inhibition of microsomal oxidation, effectively enhancing the toxicity of the pyrethroid to the honeybee. © 1995 Academic Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029104596

In each group, a donor bee was fed with sucrose solution while the 6 recipient bees remained unfed. In one experiment, donor bees were fed to satiation with either 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50% (wt/wt) sucrose solution. In a second experiment, donors were fed 20 or 40 μl, or until satiation, with 50% sucrose solution. There were significantly more trophallactic-giving contacts (TG) between donors fed 30% sucrose and their recipients than between donors fed 20% sucrose and their recipients, but no further increase was observed for higher concentrations. Increasing the volume fed to the donor bees, while keeping the concentration constant, led to an increase in TG. Analysis of the results from 61 assays involving 427 bees, shows that donor bees modify their trophallactic behaviour according to the sucrose concentration as well as the volume carried in their honey sacs.

Cells were examined at regular intervals and their contents (mother mites and offspring at different stages of development, alive or dead) were determined. A total of 908 worker cells containing 1334 mother mites and 2671 drone cells containing 3455 mother cells were found in the 3228 worker cells and 16 252 drone cells examined. The number of cells containing different numbers of mother mites did not differ significantly from a random (Poisson) distribution, irrespective of brood type (drone or worker), at any constant infestation level. The maximum number of viable adult offspring (male and female) observed in a single drone or worker cell was 16 and eight respectively. The mean number of eggs laid per mite in both drone and worker cells showed a small but steady decline as the number of mites per cell increased. Mortality of the offspring in drone cells containing up to four mother mites remained steady for the first three offspring then increased as the number of offspring in the cell increased. There was little difference in the number of viable female offspring produced in cells containing one or two mites. Competition or effects between the mother mites were less important than between their offspring and competition at the feeding site may be the major factor in offspring mortality. © 1995 International Bee Research Association.","Apis mellifera; Crowding; Drone honey bees; Fertility; Reproduction; Sealed brood; Spatial distribution; Varroa jacobsoni; Worker honey bees",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-21344456212

Such alleles are not identical by descent. This phenomenon, termed size homoplasy, was studied by sequencing electromorphs of two microsatellite loci in which the stretch of basic repeats is interrupted by different short (12 bp) DNA motifs. The number and position of these interruptions were established for electromorphs from closely and distantly related populations of honeybees and bumblebees. No sequence difference was found when electromorphs came from the same subspecies or from closely related subspecies, suggesting that they were probably identical by descent. In contrast, sequence differences were often detected in distantly related subspecies, showing that size homoplasy frequently occurs at this level of population differentiation. Size homoplasy is increased by limits to free length variation of alleles, a phenomenon that seems to act on interrupted microsatellites when comparing distantly related taxa, that is, honeybee subspecies from different evolutionary lineages. Electromorph sequences suggest that, within the scope of these limits, large mutation events have occurred frequently at both interrupted loci studied. In good agreement with the molecular data, computations based on the observed heterozygosity and number of electromorphs and simulation studies showed that neither locus fits the one-step stepwise mutant model (SMM). We speculate that interrupted microsatellites in general could be characterized by a higher variance in repeat number and consequently a lower homoplasy rate than pure ones. Hence, interrupted microsatellites should be most appropriate for investigating population differentiation and evolutionary relationship between relatively distant populations.","Apis mellifera; Bombus terrestris; bumblebee; honeybee; interrupted repeat sequences; microsatellite; mutational processes; size homoplasy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028822721

The probability for a mite to invade was dependent on the brood/bees ratio, which is defined as the number of drone brood cells capped per kg of bees. When compared with invasion in colonies with exclusively worker cells, Varroa mites invaded drone cells 11.6 times more frequently. This suggests that the biased distribution of mites over drone and worker cells in colonies with both types of brood cells results predominantly from the higher rate of invasion into a drone cell per se, when compared to that into a worker cell per se. Since the rate of invasion is high in drone cells, a trapping method using drone combs may be very effective in controlling the Varroa mite. When no other brood is present, 462 drone cells are estimated to be sufficient to trap 95% of the mites in a colony of 1 kg of bees. © 1995.","Apis mellifera; biotechnical control; drone cell; invasion behaviour; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029159213

Studies also raise questions about the developmental-process model because they relied on sequential observations of workers from one age group, thereby confounding age and environmental effects, which also affect behavior. Environmental effects were controlled by making concurrent observations of workers from four age groups introduced to a colony at six-day intervals. These groups behave differently from one another, even though they were present in the same environment, demonstrating age effects independent of environmental effects. The foraging-for-work model was evaluated by comparing workers from three age groups introduced to the colony on the same day. These groups also behaved differently, showing that the association betwwen age and behaviour is not simply an epiphenomenon resulting from old and young workers having been in the nest for different lengths of time. -Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029505096

After 24, 48 and 72 h, the concentrations of the active compounds in the desiccators were measured. Depending on the active compound and the concentration, 1 to 201 of air were sucked through adsorbent tubes (Orbo-10, Supelco). Thereafter, the active compounds were washed out with toluene and the extract analysed by gas chromatography. The values of the three air samples gave an average air concentration per treatment. One of 5 desiccators received fresh air only (550 ml/min) and served as a control. After 72 h, dead bees and Varroa were counted. The living bees were numbed with CO2, washed in alcohol to seperate remaining Varroa from their hosts and the mites and bees counted. Varroa and bee mortality was expressed as the percentage of animals found dead during the treatment in the desiccator. The air concentration which killed nearly 100 % of Varroa without noticeable loss of bees was found to be between 5 and 15 μg/l for thymol (fig 1a), between 50 and 150 μg/l for camphor (fig 1b) and between 20 and 60 μg/l air for menthol (fig 1c). 240 μg/l eucalyptol produced 100% Varroa mortality but also 25% bee mortality (fig 1d). Thymol was found to be efficient as main compound of the varroacid ""Apilife VAR"" in different types of hives. Camphor and menthol also possess the necessary characteristics of an efficient varroacid. Eucalyptol however, is not very suitable for Varroa treatment since its rate of evaporation is difficult to control and only a small difference between its toxicity for Varroa and for bees was observed. © 1995.","Apis mellifera / Varroa jacobsoni / volatile oil / toxicity / chemical control",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149326068

To discover eventual troubles of spatial orientation of the foragers, we exposed bees to sublethal doses of deltamethrin sufficiently low to avoid motor incoordination or muscular troubles. In an insect‐proof tunnel, bees were trained to forage at a feeder 8 m from their nucleus. When temperature and global radiance conditions were optimal, some foragers were caught, exposed to a deltamethrin dose 27 times lower than its LD50, and released after 20 min of recovering. Among the contaminated bees, 54% took flight toward the sun and 81% did not come back to their nest within 30 s (which is 3 times longer than the mean time of control bees). Because pyrethroids are known to disturb learning and memory, we cannot conclude if this disorientation is due either to a trouble of information storage (wrong spatial perception or phototropism increase), or to a trouble of information retrieval (bad comparison of actual and memorized patterns). Routine chemical analysis of exposed bees does not detect residues of deltamethrin 3 h after bee sublethal exposure, although bees evidenced alteration in the flight.

However, OA also potentiated reflexive sting extension responses and this potentiation persisted for at least 3 h. The different effects of OA on this behavior indicate that there are multiple targets for the neuromodulatory activity of OA on the sting response and that these targets may include muscular, motorneural, sensory or integrative elements responsible for generating stinging behavior.

Bees also distinguish between a symmetrical radial pattern and one of concentric circles, and between either of these and a neutral pattern. Having learned on sectors and circles, they discriminate a cross from a square. Therefore the local orientations are not summed over the whole target and a new model is required. We propose that the bees have detectors for symmetrical radial and circle patterns in parallel with those for orientation, and local orientation is neglected when these global (total target) detectors are excited.

We demonstrate that inhibition of nitric oxide synthase in the antennal lobes specifically interferes with neuronal processing of repetitive chemosensory stimuli but does not affect the response to single stimuli, and is independent of parameters such as satiation level, stimulus strength, interstimulus interval and duration of sensory stimuli. Since inhibition of the soluble guanylate cyclase, a major target of nitric oxide, also particularly affects the adaptive component, the physiological effects of nitric oxide appear to be mediated by the action of cGMP. These findings suggest that the nitric oxide/cGMP system in the antennal lobes is a component of the molecular machinery involved in adaptive and/or integrative mechanisms during chemosensory information processing in vivo.

The position of each antenna is controlled by two muscle systems; the basal segment (scape) is moved by four muscles within the head capsule, and two muscles within the scape control the distal segments (flagellum) of the antenna. The motor system of the scape is controlled by nine motoneurons, and that of the flagellum by six motoneurons. All of these motoneurons share the dorsal lobe as a common projection area where their dendritic fields overlap extensively. These motoneurons do not have contralateral projections. The cell bodies of the antennal motoneurons are located in the soma layer lateral to the dorsal lobe. The somata for each muscle system are arranged in three clusters; two clusters are located in a region of the cortex dorsal to the dorsal lobe and one cluster is located in the cortex ventral to the dorsal lobe. In the cortex dorsal to the dorsal lobe, one cluster of each muscle system shares the same region. Altogether five groups of cell bodies can be distinguished. Double labeling of the motoneurons and presumptive mechanosensory primary antennal afferents with fluorescent dyes has shown that there is an extensive overlap of axonal projection of antennal mechanosensory afferents with dendritic fields of antennal motoneurons. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Yield of seed from some orchards has been disappointingly low and a lack of appropriate pollinators has been suggested as a possible cause. In a study to determine what limits seed production, it is found that the number of seeds formed per capsule in eucalypts through natural open-pollination was low in relation to the number of ovules in the flower. Controlled-pollination generally increased the number of seeds per capsule, indicating that the amount of pollen reaching the stigma under open-pollination may be a limiting factor in seed production. Placing hives in seed production areas increased seed quantity and quality at the same time producing useful amounts of honey.

Honeybees respond to a stripe pattern moving up- and downward with direction specific antennal responses. The reflex can be evoked for one antenna by stimulating the ipsilateral compound eye. The direction specific antennal response (DAR) was measured with an optoelectronic device. The effects of local injection of serotonin and octopamine into different neuropils of the visual system were determined by observing changes in the direction-specific antennal response. 2. Serotonin application (approximately 500 pl at a concentration of 10-5M) into the ipsilateral lobula leads to an immediate and long lasting (at least 30 min) decrease of the DAR when the ipsilateral compound eye is stimulated. The response to stimulation of the contralateral eye is also reduced. 3. Octopamine application (approximately 500 pl at a concentration of 10-6M) into the ipsilateral lobula leads to a small enhancement of the DAR. The effect is similar when the ipsi- or contralateral eye is stimulated. 4. The modulation of the direction-specific antennal response is dose-dependent for serotonin. The two amines act in a functionally antagonistic way. 5. Serotonin injection (approximately 500 pl, 10-5M) into the medulla or lamina leads to lasting reductions of the ipsilateral DAR whereas octopamine has no effect. 6.

Based on previous studies of tracheal mites and of other blood sucking arthropods, we developed bioassay procedures to study the attractiveness of CO2 and of honey bee cuticular hydrocarbons to dispersing tracheal mites. The CO2 assay consisted of a three-choice test between streams of air, a CO2 /air mix, and a no-gas control. Air was chosen most frequently overall. Weighted scores were calculated based on the strength and frequency of response, and in this case the CO2 /air mixture was favored. Known hydrocarbon mixtures and hexane extracts of bees were applied to pipecleaners and inserted into small test hives. No tracheal mites were recovered from any of these, failing to support other studies that found these substances to be attractive in the lab.

Young queen honeybees use their venoms only for stinging other queens and possess a venom only half as lethal to mice as worker venom, and by the time queens are 1-2 years of age their venom has become essentially inactive. Phospholipase A2 is the most lethal of the honeybee venom peptides, whereas melittin, which is only slightly less lethal, is the most abundant. Concurrent analyses of melittin, phospholipase, and the combination of the two at their natural 3:1 mixture in bee venom revealed that the lethal activity of the mixture was about the same as native honeybee venom. This value was less than that for either melittin or phospholipase alone and indicates that synergism of the two peptides is not occurring.

The spatial aspect is incorporated using compartmental analysis and is developed for two spatial areas (or compartments). The exact bivariate distributions for such processes are intractable; hence approximating distributions are constructed by matching cumulants. A basic Markovian model with exponential waiting times between births is investigated first. The individual effects of swarming, multiple births, and Erlang distributed waiting times, all of which enhance the biological realism, are investigated. A full model which includes all of these effects is then studied. The models are illustrated with observed data on the spread of the Africanized honey bee in French Guiana. A full model with swarming, with an average of 2.64 colonies per swarming episode, and with waiting times following an Erlang distribution with shape parameter 5 is found to provide the best description of the observed data.

Hives in one group were each treated with a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) strip containing 0.8 g of fluvalinate. Hives in the second group each received two polyethylene strips each containing 3.6 mg of flumethrin. The third group served as a control and received no treatment.

The sequence is 15,722 by in length and contains 75.3% A+T, the lowest value in any of the five insect mitochondrial sequences so far determined. The protein coding genes have a similar A+T content (74.1%) but are distinguished by a high cytosine content at the third codon position. The gene content and organization are the same as in Drosophila yakuba except for a rearrangement of the two tRNA genes tRNAlys and tRNAasp. The A+T-rich region has a lower A+T nucleotide content than in other insects, and this is largely due to the presence of two G+C-rich 155-bp repetitive sequences at the 5′ end of this section and the beginning of the adjacent small rRNA gene. The sizes of the large and small rRNA genes are 1,314 and 827 bp, respectively, and both sequences can be folded to form secondary structures similar to those previously predicted for Drosophila. The tRNA genes have also been modeled and these show a strong resemblance to the dipteran tRNAs, all anticodons apparently being conserved between the two species. A comparison of the protein coding nucleotide sequences of the locust DNA with the homologous sequences of five other arthropods (Drosophila yakuba, Anopheles quadrimaculatus, Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, and Artemia franciscana) was performed. The amino acid composition of the encoded proteins in Locusta is similar to that of Drosophila, with a Dayhoff distance twice that of the distance between the fruit fly and the mosquitoes. A phylogenetic analysis revealed the locust genes to be more similar to those of the Dipterans than to those of the honeybee at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels. A comparative analysis of tRNA orders, using crustacean mtDNAs as outgroups, supported this. This high level of divergence in the Apis genome has been noted elsewhere and is possibly an effect of directional mutation pressure having resulted in an accelerated pattern of sequence evolution. If the general assumption that the Holometabola are monophyletic holds, then these results emphasize the difficulties of reconstructing phylogenies that include lineages with variable substitution rates and base composition biases. The need to exercise caution in using information about tRNA gene orders in phylogenetic analysis is also illustrated. However, if the honeybee sequence is excluded, the correspondence between the other five arthropod sequences supports the findings of previous studies which have endorsed the use of mtDNA sequences for studies of phylogeny at deep levels of taxonomy when mutation rates are equivalent. © 1995, Springer-Verlag New York Inc.

Undertaking behaviour (removal of dead bees from the nest) was studied because it is possible to vary the level of corpse-removal stimuli in a precise way. Subfamilies of workers with low thresholds of response to corpses were predicted to be overrepresented as undertakers relative to subfamilies with higher thresholds, and this difference was predicted to be reduced under higher stimulus conditions (more corpses). Allozyme analyses revealed that the genotypic composition of the undertaker group that responded to a low stimulus was significantly different from the composition of the whole colony. Contrary to predictions, the genotypic composition of the undertaker group that responded to a high stimulus was just as different from the composition of the whole colony. A second experiment examined the effects of undertaker depletion (about 2-3% of each colony’s population): there were significant decreases in rates of corpse removal for several days following the removal of undertakers. These results suggest that strong genetic influences on the likelihood that an individual worker will perform a particular task, such as undertaking, may constrain a colony’s ability to respond to changing conditions. © 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028977503

Experiments presented bees with a floral dimorphism in a flower patch where a pattern representative of anthers was either coated or not coated with calcium oxalate, but where the flower colour in an experiment was always the same (blue, white, or yellow). Flowers were arranged randomly as to presence or absence of calcium oxalate and flower patches were changed periodically in each experiment so that flower position would not become a factor determining flower choice. Each experiment used a new set of naive bees that had not foraged on the artificial flowers before. Each bee extensively visited both flower types when rewards were identical in competing flower morphs. The presence of calcium oxalate thus did not increase a flower’s attractiveness to foragers. However, when a reward difference (1 M vs. 2 M sucrose) existed between competing flower morphs, bees preferred the flower type offering the higher caloric reward. Bees thus used calcium oxalate as a reward-correlated visual cue to maximize net caloric gain while foraging. © 1995 International Bee Research Association.","Anthers; Apis mellifera; Calcium oxalate; Flower fidelity; Foraging; Honey bees; Visual cues",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84953598638

The type of cell strongly affected the number of mites per cell, and the attractive period of the cells to the mites. The type of cell also affected the distance from larva to cell rim preceding cell capping. When this distance was larger in comparison to control cells of the same age, the attractive period of the brood cells was shorter and vice versa. Since in all cell types the distance from larva to cell rim continuously decreased preceding cell capping, this negative correlation is in agreement with the hypothesis that there is a critical larva‐rim distance under which brood cells are attractive to mites. Then, the length of the attractive period of brood cells depends on the moment this critical distance is reached. The distribution of mites over different cell types in turn results from differences in the attractive period. 1995 The Netherlands Entomological Society","Apis mellifera; brood cell attractiveness; invasion behaviour; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028978959

The availability of pollen from staminate flowers in an orchard with few foraging bees continued to increase from the time of anther dehiscence until the late afternoon.

In two experiments, we investigated the orientation of displaced bees when a landmark (target) was close to the goal under different weather conditions. It is shown that in sunny conditions, the celestial compass will override target orientation under most conditions. Under 100% cloud cover, the celestial compass direction retrieved from landmarks modulates target‐orientated behaviour but is not by itself a primary orientation factor. The bees will fly toward a previously encountered landmark that signals the target, and in case of several similar landmarks which are visible to the bees, they will choose the one in the direction nearest the celestial compass direction.

The results indicate that larvae of the ARS-Y-C-1 stock, which has been selected for resistance to V. jacobsoni, are less attractive to female mites than the larvae of some other honey bee stocks. © 1995 International Bee Research Association.","Apis mellifera carnica; Attractivenes; Grafting; Honey bees; Host parasite relationships; Larvae; Resistance; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-21844496046

(Hymenoptera: Apidae), prior to invasion into brood cells. The maximum period on adult bees was 23 days. To introduce mites, combs with emerging worker brood, heavily infested with mites, were placed into a colony and removed the next day. At the beginning of the first day following emergence from brood cells, 18% of the mites introduced into the colony was found on the bottom of the hive. Part of these mites may already have died inside the capped brood cells, and then fallen down after cleaning of cells by the bees. At the second and third day following emergence, respectively 4% and 2% of the mites on adult bees at the previous day was recovered on the bottom, whereas from the fourth day on only 0.6% of the mites on adult bees was recovered on the bottom per day. After invasion into brood cells, 8–12% of the mites did not produce any offspring. Of the mites that did reproduce, the total number of offspring was 4.0–4.4 per mite during one reproductive cycle, part of which may reach maturity resulting in 1.2–1.3 viable daughters, and 8–10% of the mites produced only male offspring.

It is known to exist as an α-helical tetramer, as an α-helical monomer, or as a monomeric random coil depending on solvent conditions. The charge state of MLT is believed to be a major factor in determining its aggregation properties and its interaction with lipids. Several, contradictory, indirect measurements of the pKa values of the three lysine groups in MLT have been reported. In the present study, high-resolution 15N NMR at 50.6 MHz was used to directly measure the pKa values of the amino groups of the Gly-1, Lys-7, Lys-21, and Lys-23 residues of MLT. Specifically, the pH dependence of MLT 15N chemical shifts was measured separately for the isotopically enriched backbone nitrogen of Gly-1 and the side chain nitrogen atoms of Lys-7, Lys-21, and Lys-23 at a MLT concentration of 1.2 mM and a temperature of 23 °C. Measurements were made for MLT in potassium phosphate buffer, in neat water, and in l-myristoyl-2-hydroxyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (MMPC) lipid micelles. The experiments showed for MLT tetramer in aqueous phosphate buffer that the amino nitrogen of Gly-1 has a pKa of 8.15, and that the Lys-7, Lys-21, and Lys-23 side chain nitrogen atoms have pKa values of 10.21, 10.03, and 10.24 respectively. The pKa values were somewhat lower for MLT in neat water with Gly-1 at 7.85 (in which case MLT is a monomer), and Lys-21 and Lys-23 at 9.83 and 9.70, respectively (in which case MLT is a tetramer). Similarly for MLT in 48 mM MMPC micelles and 50 mM potassium phosphate, the values are 7.90, 10.09, 9.87, and 10.10 for Gly-1, Lys-7, Lys-21, and Lys-23, respectively. These pKa values indicate that the lysine residues are positively charged when MLT forms a tetramer at pH values between 8.5 and 10. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

Workers from European queens (4 commercial queens from California plus 2 open stock queens and 2 feral queens from Louisiana) were reared with 4 ratios of nurse bees:eggs: 0.5:1,1:1, 5:1, and 100:1. Measurements of 25 morphometric variables were taken from each of 32 samples of usually ten bees per sample. Raw measurements of stressed bees were analysed separately by analysis of variance and multiple range tests. The treatments resulted in different phenotypes irrespective of the queen or her geographic origin. Workers reared at ratios of 0.5:1,1:1 and 5:1 were consistently smaller than workers reared at 100:1. Based on the size of the workers reared at 0.5:1, the initial ratio was apparently altered by the nurse bees, who probably destroyed eggs or larvae, to yield a ratio close to 5:1. This homeostatic behaviour under stress produced adult bees closer to normal size. Principal component analysis showed that 11 of 14 variables involving distance measurements were highly related to the first principal or general size component (PC1) in both stressed and normal bees. Such variables, when standardized, had consistent linear regressions on PC1. Evidence of curvilinear regression among size-related variables was inconsistent and limited to three instances, each involving less than 1 % of variance. The correlations of size-related variables with PC1 for European, Africanized, and stressed bees had a similar pattern but the correlations often differed in magnitude. The slopes of linear regression for most size-related variables of European and Africanized bees were the same. Africanized bees, however, were not simply scaled reductions of the larger European bees, but exhibited differences among most size-related variables in Y intercepts. The induced variation in morphometrics of stressed European bees simulated some features of the covariation observed in normal European and Africanized bees, but differences existed in the magnitudes of correlations, and slopes and Y intercepts of most size-related variables with respect to PC1. Despite the small size of some stressed bees, classification of the abnormal phenotypes by current methods gave only 2 samples misidentified as Africanized. © 1995 International Bee Research Association.","Africanized honey bees; Apis mellifera; European honey bees; Identification; Morphometries; Nurse honey bees; Nutritional stress; Principal component analysis; Size; Worker honey bees",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-21844527258

This was repeated sixteen times between August 1990 and August 1992. Seven repetitions occurred during nectar flow periods and nine repetitions occurred during nectar-dearth periods. Overall, 59% of 576 queens were successfully introduced and mated. The best results (93% success) were obtained during nectar flows, with 3- to 4-day-old queens released into nuclei containing capped brood. During nectar dearths the best mating success came from queens introduced into broodless nuclei (63%), the age of the queen did not influence mating success.

In Morocco, we found eight haplotypes, all characteristic of the African (A) lineage, suggesting that most if not all the maternal lineages of the colonies repeatedly imported from Europe over the last 150 years have not contributed mitochondrial genomes to the local population. Using two new genetic distances analogous to the shared allele distance defined for nuclear genes, we showed that Morocco was most probably colonized by two sublineages, one from the north‐east and the other one from the south of the country and that the contact zone between them extends along both sides of the Atlas range. In Spain, we found eight haplotypes characteristic of lineage A (six in common with Morocco) and four of lineage M (the West European lineage). The distribution of haplotypes of both lineages forms a gradient with c. 10% of lineage M in the south of Spain (Seville) and up to 100% in the north (San Sebastian). Three hypotheses are presented to explain the large differences of haplotype frequencies between Moroccan and lineage A Spanish colonies: a non‐Moroccan origin of lineage A in Spain, an ancient Moroccan origin or a recent Moroccan origin with a rapid shift of haplotype frequencies due to a founder effect.

Taurine‐like immunoreactivity (Tau‐IR) is expressed in sensory neurons of several modalities, namely visual, olfactory, gustatory, and mechanosensory. Staining intensity is very high in the larva and in the first half of the pupal stage and gradually decreases towards the end of metamorphosis. In the photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes, Tau‐IR can be detected from the fifth larval instar onwards, prior to differentiation of other components of the ommatidium. Already in the midstage larvae, when the antennal primordia of the adult still lie within the peripodial cavity, a few presumably mechanosensory neurons are labelled in the pedicellus of the developing antenna. The majority of the antennal sensory neurons which are located on the flagellum start to exhibit Tau‐IR upon pupation, long before any cuticular specializations such as sensory hairs or plates are detectable. All known types of antennal sensilla were identified and it could be shown that all of them are innervated by Tau‐IR sensory neurons. Thus, taurine immunocytochemistry can be applied as a useful label for developing sensory neurons. Functional implications of taurine during development are discussed. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

In the latter case, this decrease will be with respect to a background firing rate determined by intrinsic (internal noise) and extrinsic (background odors) factors. To analyse receptor neurons of this complexity, we extend Beidler's model of receptor protein activation dynamics to account for the competition between depolarizing and hyperpolarizing pathways and couple the model to a phenomenological description of the non-linear relationship between the proportion of activate membrane receptors and the receptor cell spike generation rates. We then examine the implications of this theory for predicting the response of receptor neurons to odor mixtures based on their response to pure odorants at concentrations matched to the mixture. We derive inequalities that must be satisfied under our normative model, and propose that deviations from the model be designated as synergisms and inhibitions, depending on the direction in which various equalities and inequalities are violated. We then apply our inequalities to identifying synergisms and inhibitions in data analysed in a different way elsewhere (Akers, R.P. and Getz, W.M. Response of olfactory receptor neurons in honey bees to odorants and their binary mixtures. J. Comp. Physiol. (in press)). In these data regarding the response of honey bee placode sensilla to a number of odorants and their binary combinations, we demonstrate the presence of synergisms and inhibitions - that is, elevated or repressed responses that are not due to competitive interactions of mixture component odorants for receptor sites or Beidler (Beidler, L.M., 1962.

The variations covered 2 frequency bands within the range of 0.4 Hz to 1.2 Hz. Periodical variations of spike rate were present when no visible antennal movements occurred and also when accompanied by spontaneous antennal twitches or during swaying movement of the antennae. Swaying movements took place at the end of short antennal movement episodes with a frequency that corresponded to the periodical variations in spike rate. Thus, there may be a relation between episodes of antennal movements and rhythmic spike activity recorded in the mushroom bodies during episodes of antennal immobility.","apis mellifera; arousal; comparative sleep research; mushroom bodies; neural rhythms",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028851499

In this model, thin filaments are mechanically severed from their connections to the Z‐line and may then slide freely over the myosin filament when activated. The model is similar to the in vitro motility assay in that untethered actin filaments slide over myosin, but here the natural filament lattice is retained: sliding takes place through the lattice of thick filaments. We find, in this model, that while the extent of thin filament translation is variable from sarcomere to sarcomere, filaments never translate far enough to enter the opposite I‐band. Unlike the in vitro motility assay, where the actin filament translates over the entire thick filament even with “incorrectly” polarized crossbridges as the sole driver, in this intact filament‐lattice model, cross‐bridges are apparently unable to move filaments in both directions. We also find that the pattern of filament translation is collective. Although the extent of translation may vary among sarcomeres, in any given half‐sarcomere all actin filaments translate by the same degree. Further, the extent of translation is is the same in both halves of a given sarcomere. In rare instances where the extent of translation exhibited a transverse gradient across the myofibrillar half‐sarcomere, the gradient was similar on both sides of the sarcomere. Filament translation within the sarcomere is thus collective. Some mechanism ensures that nearby but distinctly separated actin filaments move together and that cooperative‐like behavior therefore extends to the supramolecular level.

The action of melittin has been thought to be closely related with its ability to facilitate the phospholipase A2 activity on the eggs. However, another peptide “mastoparan” from wasp venom was not found here to cause any elevation of the membrane, although it can activate the enzyme as well as melittin. On the other hand, mastoparan was found to get the membrane-elevating activity only when its amino groups were modified with hydrophobic substituents. N∈-Substituted mastoparan with a dansyl group in Lys11 residue was most effective among the analogs examined here. Our findings indicate that the facilitation of phospholipase by the peptides have little relation with the membrane generation. Such hydrophobic moiety as the dansyl group in the peptides must cause the cortical reaction on the eggs in cooperation with peptide moiety.

This study demonstrates that injections of octopamine or cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) into the primary chemosensory neuropil of the honeybee, the antennal lobe, evokes a rapid and transient activation of cAMP‐dependent protein kinase (PKA). Other monoamines detectable in the antennal lobe, dopamine and serotonin, do not affect the level of PKA activity. Stimulation of the bees' antenna with the appetitive stimulus water or sucrose solution in vivo also causes a short‐term activation of PKA in the antennal lobe. The increased PKA activity can be detected immediately (0.5 s) after stimulation but reverts to the basal level within 3 s. This effect can be abolished by monoamine depletion with reserpine. Since octopamine is the only monoamine that stimulates PKA, it appears to mediate the PKA activation after sucrose stimulus and may contribute to the processing of this chemosensory input. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

It studies the structure and pharmacology of octopamine receptors using two different radioligands. In addition to the natural agonist octopamine, the phenlyiminoimidazolidine derivative 3H-NC-SZ served as the second radioligand. Because it has a higher affinity and it is not degraded by endogenous enzymes, it is much better suited for ligand-binding studies. Using these radioligands, the octopamine receptor of the locusts, Schistocerca gregaria and Locusta migratoria, and the honey bee Apis mellifera are studied in detail in the chapter. In all these preparations, octopamine receptors are present in relatively high concentrations. In the desert locust—for example, Schistocerca gregaria—the maximal concentration of binding sites is approx. 10-times higher if compared with 5-HT and 20-times higher if compared with dopamine receptors. Only the neuronal histamine H1-like receptor has a slightly higher concentration of binding sites. This indicates the important role of octopamine in the nervous system of insects. Most pharmacological studies of insect neuronal octopamine receptors have been performed using locusts. High-affinity antagonists are well suited for physiological studies. The most important among them are the tetracyclic substances, mianserin and, with even higher affinity, the structurally related substance, maroxepine. © 1995, Academic Press Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029589447

The landmarks were placed at regular intervals of 90 m. During training, the feeder was located directly in front of the third (target) landmark. In the tests, bees were given the choice of landing at the trained distance or at the target landmark which had been displaced to a different distance. Bees preferred to land at the target landmark when the discrepancy between the two indicated distances was small, but landed mostly at the trained distance if the discrepancy was large. Furthermore, distance estimation depended on landmarks encountered during flight. When the target landmark was placed at a distance from the hive closer than the trained distance, the bees’ readiness to respond to this landmark could be increased only if bees had already passed the landmark that preceded the target landmark during training. Thus, a given flight goal is defined in the bees’ memory by its distance from the hive, landmarks that mark the goal, and landmarks that precede the goal during flight.

Supporting evidence for their octopaminergic nature is mentioned where available. In orthopteran ventral ganglia, the major classes of octopamine-like immunoreactive (-LI) neurones include: (1) efferent dorsal and ventral unpaired median (DUM, VUM) neurones; (2) several intersegmentally projecting DUM interneurones in the suboesophageal ganglion; other DUM interneurones are probably GABAergic; (3) a pair of anterior median cells in the prothoracic ganglion; (4) a single pair of ventral cells in most thoracic and some other ganglia; these appear to be plurisegmentally projecting interneurones. Eight categories of octopamine-LI neurones occur in the orthopteran brain. The basic projections of three types are described here: one class project to the optic lobes to form wide field projections. Another type descends to cross into the tritocerebral commissure and may invade the contralateral brain hemisphere. A further class is the median neurosecretory cells with axons in the nervi corpori cardiaci I. Available data for the honey bee Apis mellifera and moth Manduca sexta indicate that the octopamine-LI cell types found in orthopterans also occur in holometabolous insects. Immunocytochemical evidence suggests that some octopaminergic DUM cells contain an FMRFamide-related peptide and the amino acid taurine as putative cotransmitters. © 1995.","Central nervous system; Dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurones; Immunocytochemistry; Neurosecretory cells; Octopamine",Short Survey,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028854171

Tissue sampled was obtained from queens in five different behavioral and reproductive states: 1-day-old virgin queens, 14-day-old virgin queens, 14-day-old instrumentally inseminated queens, 9- to 13-day old naturally mated queens, and 5-month-old naturally mated queens. There were significant volume changes within the mushroom bodies during the first 2 weeks of adult life. The volume occupied by the somata of the intrinsic neuronal population (Kenyon cells) of the mushroom bodies decreased by approximately 30% and the volume of the neuropil of the mushroom bodies increased between 25 and 50%. These volume changes are strikingly similar to those previously reported to occur for worker honey bees switching from hive activities to foraging (Withers, Fahrbach, and Robinson, 1993). However, in this study they were found even in queens that had no flight experience. In addition, queens exhibiting these volume changes were found to have low blood levels of juvenile hormone, while previous studies have shown that foraging worker honey bees have high hormone levels. These results suggest that some aspect of behavioral development common to both the queen and the worker castes is fundamental to protocerebral volume changes early in adulthood in honey bees. If juvenile hormone regulates this process, results from queens suggest that it may play an organizational role. © 1995 Academic Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028968475

In making NPVs a more attractive pest management tool, this problem has been addressed by modifying NPVs genetically to express insecticidal proteins resulting in substantial increases in their speed of action. One concern associated with these recombinant NPVs, however, is their effects on nontarget insects associated with pests targeted for control by applications of NPVs. Our studies evaluated the direct effects of wild-type Autographa californica NPV (AcNPV) and a recombinant AcNPV (AcAaIT) on three insects beneficial to production agriculture. The recombinant NPV expresses an insect-selective neurotoxin, AaIT, which was isolated from the scorpion, Androctonus australis Hector. Two generalist predators, Chysoperla carnea Stephens and Orius insidiosus (Say), were not adversely affected by feeding on larvae of Heliothis virescens (F.) infected with AcAaIT. Similarly, no adverse effects were detected in the honey bee, Apis mellifera L., when injected with wild-type or recombinant NPVs.

Mite populations declined as flowering decreased and were locally extinct by 20 January. Individual mangrove florets lasted about 6 d; umbels were in flower for about 10 d. Unopened buds were mite‐free, but newly opened florets were colonised by all post‐embryonic stages of the mite. In the laboratory, the mites fed on pollen and sugar water. Mites dispersed on honeybees (Apis mellifera) primarily as egg‐bearing adult females; however, a relatively small proportion of males and immature stages also occurred on bees. Only adult females have sucker‐like ambulacral pads lacking claws, an apparent adaptation for phoresy. Most mites boarded and departed the bee via the tongue and were found on the venter of the head and thorax of the bee. Additionally, bees collected mites with pollen, and crushed many immature mites into their pollen baskets. Large populations of mites occurred on honeybees at beehives during late April.

We studied which constituent(s) of the venom induces cardiotoxicity and how, using cultured cardiac myocytes from mouse fetuses. Among the venom constituents, only melittin caused contractile and morphological effects; other peptides, such as apamin and mastparan; enzymes, such as phospholipase A2; and low-molecular-weight compounds, such as histamine and dopamine, did not. Treatment with 4.5 μg/ml melittin, which accounts for about half the dry weight of the venom, induced the same cardiotoxic effects as treatment with 9.0 μg/ml whole venom; these effects were a transient increase in the spontaneous beating rate, then a decrease, then cessation of beating, and finally, morphological degeneration. The cardiotoxicity of whole bee venom was completely destroyed by pretreatment of the venom with antimelittin antibody. These results suggest that bee venom cardiotoxicity is attributable to melittin. When spontaneous beating ceased following the addition of melittin or whole venom, an increase in systolic [Ca2+]i was observed. On further incubation with melittin or bee venom, morphological injury, such as balloon degeneration, occurred concomitant with a further increase in the [Ca2+]i. An extracellular Ca2+ concentration of more than 10(-6) M was necessary for morphological injury. Melittin depolarized the maximum diastolic potentials, inhibited the generation of action potentials, and induced an increase in [Na+]i. Cells were protected against the melittin-induced increase in [Ca2+]i by pretreatment with bepridil, an inhibitor of Na+-Ca2+ exchange, but not by Ca2+ channel blockers such as verapamil. These observations suggest that the melittin-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was due to entry of extracellular Ca2+ via the sarcolemmal Na+-Ca2+ exchange system. © 1995 Academic Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029060806

Information encoded in the dance was used to determine the distance and direction that bees flew from the hive for pollen and nectar and to construct foraging maps for each colony.

Here, we examine the role of the cytoskeleton in organizing this submicrovillar endoplasmic reticulum in honeybee photoreceptors. Immunofluorescence microscopy of taxol-stabilized specimens, and electron-microscopic examination of high-pressure frozen, freeze-substituted retinae demonstrate that the submicrovillar cytoplasm lacks microtubules. The submicrovillar region contains a conspicuous F-actin system that codistributes with the submicrovillar endoplasmic reticulum. Incubation of retinal tissue with cytochalasin B leads to depolymerization of the submicrovillar F-actin system, and to disorganization and disintegration of the submicrovillar endoplasmic reticulum, indicating that an intact F-actin cytoskeleton is required to maintain the architecture of this domain of the endoplasmic reticulum. We have also developed a permeabilized cell model in order to study the physiological requirements for the interaction of the endoplasmic reticulum with actin filaments.

Honeybees Apis mellifera ligustica were trained to work on a patch with artificial rewarding and non-rewarding flowers, coupled to an air extractor. The perceptual colour distance between the rewarding and the non-rewarding flowers was varied and the flower choice and the repellent scent-marking behaviour of the bees were recorded. 2. The discrimination between rewarding and non-rewarding flowers depended on their colour distance, improving with a greater colour difference. This task was guided thus visually and was not affected by activating the air extractor. 3. The scent-marking activity was only observable when the colour information of both groups of flowers was the same or very similar. This thus represents the first reported case of a modulation of an olfactory activity through the visual input provided by colour distances. When the air extractor was activated, rejections associated with the scent-marking behaviour disappeared, thus confirming the olfactory nature of this behaviour. 4. Honeybees are thus capable of using one or more sensory cues to enhance their foraging efficiency, according to the environmental situation. This great plasticity allows them to attain an enhanced efficiency while foraging. 5. We successfully applied the model of colour choice behaviour of the honeybee. Since the original theory was developed for Apis mellifera carnica, this work also constitutes the first attempt to describe the behaviour of the honeybee race, Apis mellifera ligustica, using the postulated model, and reaffirms thus its generality. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Colour vision; Efficiency; Foraging; Honeybees; Scent marking",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028079462

In contrast, sizable experimental infections are required for induction of the normally silent hymenoptaecin, abaecin, and bee defensin genes; even so, bee defensin transcription is minimal and delayed, and only minute quantities of corresponding peptide are produced. The specific, temporal organization of the multi-component immune response in bees has therefore likely been selected to cope with infection of prevalent, plant-associated Gram-negative bacteria. Post-translational processing and modifications are substantially different for each of the four antibacterial peptides. While no similarities were observed among precursor structures of the various bee peptides, surprisingly, the signal sequences of abaecin (bee) and drosocin (Drosophila) shared unmistakable homology, possibly indicating common ancestral secretion/processing mechanisms. Finally, we report that bee defensin contains a typical disulfide-rich structure (40 amino acids) but also a unique, amphipathic, putatively amidated carboxyl-terminal tail (10 amino acids).

Recent studies by Seeley (1992) and Kirchner (1993) have revealed that this behaviour is part of the recruitment communication system of bees. The ultimate cause of tremble dances is, according to Seeley (1992), an imbalance between the nectar intake rate and the nectar processing capacity of the colony. This imbalance is correlated with a long initial search time of returning foragers to find bees to unload them. However, it remained unclear whether a long search time is the direct proximate cause of tremble dancing. Here we report that a variety of experimental conditions can elicit tremble dances. All of them have in common that the total search time that foragers spend searching for unloaders, until they are fully unloaded, is prolonged. This finding supports and extends the hypothesis that a long search time is the proximate cause of tremble dancing. The results also confirm the previous reports of Lindauer (1948) and others about factors eliciting tremble dancing. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Communication; Foraging; Recruitment; Tremble dance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028165231

In the venter-to-venter position, the male clasped the female between her legs I and II, with his legs I.

The consequences when using different mating, import, and selection strategies on diploid drone frequency and genetic gain, was explored with Monte Carlo computer simulations. Within a closed population breeding structure, mass selection gave the highest genetic gain in the quantitative trait, but also the largest increase in percentage diploid drones and queens with unacceptably-low brood viability. Mass selection combined with truncation selection against queens having more than 15% diploid drones gave a comparable genetic gain and was the best strategy of the ones studied to avoid diploid drones. Within-family selection (one replacement per sib group) gave the least genetic gain, and a frequency of diploid drones comparable to random (no) selection. It was intermediate between mass selection and mass selection combined with viability selection concerning the frequency of diploid drones. Insemination with pooled and homogenized semen originating from all breeder queens (30), as compared to natural mating with 12 randomly-selected drones, had little effect on the genetic gain and on the overall frequency of diploid drones (10 to 15% by generation 20). The effect of opening the closed breeding population for the import of external queens every generation, by exchanging breeder queens of lowest performance with a corresponding number of new queens (5, 10and 15 out of 30), was also investigated. Under mass selection (natural mating as well as artificial insemination) the frequency of diploid drones and the proportion of queens discarded were reduced because of low brood viability. However, artificial insemination was superior to natural mating considering the latter criterion. If the imported queens were at the same genetic level for the quantitative trait under selection as the whole breeding population at that generation, or 10% better, the genetic gain was respectively slightly reduced and approximately maintained. If the imported queens were of inferior quality (equal to the initial population) the import of queens slowed genetic progress considerably. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Closed population Diploid drones; Genetic gain Monte Carlo simulation; Inbreeding",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028251314

Individual queen bees (reproductive females) were mated to single drones (fertile males) by instrumental insemination. Haploid drone progeny of an F1 queen were each backcrossed to daughter queens from one of the parental lines. Ninety-eight of the resulting colonies containing backcross progeny were evaluated for the trait 'low brood-viability' resulting from the production of diploid drones that were homozygous at X. DNA samples from the haploid drone fathers of these colonies were used individually in polymerase chain reactions (PCR) with 10-base primers. These reactions generated random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers that were analyzed for cosegregation with the colony-level phenotype. One RAPD marker allele was shared by 22 of 25 drones that fathered low brood-viability colonies. The RAPD marker fragment was cloned and partially sequenced. Two primers were designed that define a sequence-tagged site (STS) for this locus. The primers amplified DNA marker fragments that cosegregated with the original RAPD marker. In order to more precisely estimate the linkage between X and the STS locus, another group of bees consisting of progeny from one of the low-brood viability colonies was used in segregation analysis. Four diploid drones and 181 of their diploid sisters (workers, nonfertile females) were tested for segregation of the RAPD and STS markers. The cosegregating RAPD and STS markers were codominant due to the occurrence of fragment-length alleles. The four diploid drones were homozygous for these markers but only three of the 181 workers were homozygotes (recombinants). Therefore the distance between X and the STS locus was estimated at 1.6 cM.

Here we determine whether these puzzling results are best explained by either inadequate sampling of the laying worker population or reproductive conflict among workers resulting in differential treatment of eggs and larvae. Using colonies composed of workers from electrophoretically distinct subfamilies, we collected samples of adult bees engaged in the following behavior: ""true"" egg laying, ""false"" egg laying, indeterminate egg laying, egg cannibalism, or nursing (contact with larvae). We also collected samples of drone brood at four different ages: 0 to 2.5-h-old eggs, 0 to 24-h-old eggs, 3 to 8-day-old larvae, and 9 to 14-day-old larvae and pupae. Allozyme analyses revealed significant subfamily differences in the likelihood of exhibiting egg laying, egg cannibalism, and nursing behavior, as well as significant subfamily differences in drone production. There were no subfamily differences among the different types of laying workers collected from each colony, suggesting that discrepancies between subfamily biases in egg-laying behavior and drone production are not due to inadequate sampling of the laying worker population. Subfamily biases in drone brood production within a colony changed significantly with brood age. Laying workers had significantly more developed ovaries than either egg cannibals or nurses, establishing a physiological correlate for the observed behavioral genetic differences. These results suggest there is reproductive conflict among subfamilies and individuals within queenless colonies of honey bees. The implications of these results for the evolution of reproductive conflict, in both queenright and queenless contexts, are discussed. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Allozymes; Apis mellifera; Drone production; Genetics; Reproductive conflict",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028164477

The periods of the activity rhythms of individual isolated bees were longer than 24 h in self-selected light-dark and constant light, while they were shorter than 24 h in constant darkness.

Here we describe a preparation in which we studied ionic currents in the isolated Kenyon cell somata, using tight-seal whole-cell recording. Several outward and inward currents were identified and investigated by the use of pharmacological agents and in ion substitution experiments: a rapidly inactivating A-type potassium current that is completely blocked with 5 mM 4-aminopyridine; a calcium-activated potassium current that is blocked by 1-100 nM charybdotoxin; a delayed rectifier-type potassium current that is only weakly sensitive to tetraethylammonium but is blocked by 100 μM quinidine; a rapidly activating and inactivating, TTX-sensitive sodium current; a persistent sodium current that is both TTX and cadmium sensitive; and a calcium current that is completely blocked at 50 μM cadmium and is affected by verapamil and nifedipine only at high concentrations (100 μM). The currents described here are very similar to currents found in other insect neurons or muscle cells. This preparation will not only facilitate studies concerning the action of transmitters and neuromodulators that are contained within neurons converging onto the Kenyon cells, but will also allow a study of the role of the adenylyl cyclase pathway, elements of which are expressed in Kenyon cells, and are known to be essential for learning in invertebrates.","calcium currents; insect; potassium currents; sodium currents; whole-cell patch clamp",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028041227

We examined the physical and chemical composition of North American samples of bee propolis from several sites in North America and tested for bioactivity against larvae of the greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella L.), a common apiary pest. The amount of methanol-extractable resin in samples from Ohio and Georgia ranged from 24% to 79% by weight.

This transformation is required because existing methods tend to group sequences on the basis of their nucleotide composition, irrespective of their evolutionary history. This effect of differing nucleotide frequencies is illustrated by using a tree-selection criterion on a simple distance measure defined solely on the basis of base composition, independent of the actual sequences. The new LogDet transformation uses determinants of the observed divergence matrices and works because multiplication of determinants (real numbers) is commutative, whereas multiplication of matrices is not, except in special symmetric cases. The use of determinants thus allows more general models of evolution with asymmetric rates of nucleotide change. The transformation is illustrated on a theoretical data set (where existing methods select the wrong tree) and with three biological data sets: chloroplasts, birds/mammals (nuclear), and honeybees (mitochondrial). The LogDet transformation reinforces the logical distinction between transformations on the data and tree-selection criteria. The overall conclusions from this study are that irregular A,C,G,T compositions are an important and possible general cause of patterns that can mislead tree-reconstruction methods, even when high bootstrap values are obtained.

Using colonies composed of workers from two identifiable genotype groups, we determined that intracolony differences in the likelihood of becoming a precocious forager are a consequence of differences in rates of behavioral development that are also evident under conditions leading to normal development. An alternative hypothesis, that differences in the likelihood of becoming a precocious forager are due to differences in general sensitivity to altered colony conditions, was not supported. In three out of three trials, workers from the genotype group that was more likely to exhibit precocious foraging in single cohort colonies also foraged at relatively younger ages in colonies in which workers exhibited normal behavioral development. In contrast, in three out of three trials, workers from the genotype group that was more likely to exhibit precocious foraging in single-cohort colonies did not show disproportionately more overaged nursing in colonies in which workers exhibited delayed development.

Prior to absconding, waggle dances regularly communicated distances up to 10-20 km from the nests. However, compared to waggle dances observed during nonabsconding periods, those occurring prior to migration were less associated with food sources, occurred during periods of little or no flight activity, and exhibited great variability in the communication of distance by consecutive waggle runs of individual bees. It is therefore unlikely that ""migration dances"" communicated the locations of, or stimulated immediate recruitment for, specific foraging or nesting sites. Rather, the dances may have functioned to establish a general route of travel. The majority of migration dances observed were oriented in an easterly direction, and upon departure both colonies traveled towards the E-SE. The orientation of migration dances occurred independently of the directions communicated by waggle dances associated with past foraging success or the sampling of alternate foraging areas. Migration dance orientation may have been affected by prevailing wind directions, because during the migration period winds blew primarily from the east. However, it is unlikely that wind direction was the only factor influencing migration dance orientation. The lack of immediate flight activity associated with migration dance performance suggests the dances may have gradually prepared colonies for migratory movement by conveying a message to fly for a long, but unspecified distance in a certain direction. Waggle dances associated with migration may therefore function differently from those associated with foraging and nest site selection, which convey both the distance and direction to specific locations. © 1994 Birkhäuser Verlag.","absconding; Apis mellifera scutellata; Honey bee; migration; waggle dance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028039290

These components are of two types, those that affect foraging behavior and those that affect life-history characteristics of workers. Variable foraging behavior components are: the probability that foraging workers collect (1) pollen only; (2) nectar only; and (3) pollen and nectar on the same trip. Life history components are: (1) the age the workers initiate foraging behavior; (2) the length of the foraging life of a worker; and (3) worker length of life. We show how these components may interact to change the social organization of honey bee colonies and the lifetime foraging productivity of individual workers. Selection acting on foraging behavior components may result in changes in the proportion of workers collecting pollen and nectar. Selection acting on life-history components may affect the size of the foraging population and the distribution of workers between within nest and foraging activities. We suggest that these components define possible sociogenic ""pathways"" through which colony-level natural selection can change social organization. These pathways may be analogous to developmental pathways in the morphogenesis of individual organisms because small changes in behavioral or life history components of individual workers may lead to major changes in the organizational structure of colonies. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Division of labor; Genetics; Social insects",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34249763779

Middle-age bees (ca. 2 weeks old) performing different tasks showed significant differences in both juvenile hormone (JH) biosynthesis rates and hemolymph titers; guards and undertakers had high JH, and wax producers and food storers, low JH. Guards and undertakers had similar hormone levels to foragers, even though they were 10 days younger than foragers. No differences in JH were detected among young bees (1-week-old queen attendants and nurses) or older bees (3-4 week-old pollen foragers, non-pollen foragers, and soldiers). Hypopharyngeal gland size was inversely correlated with worker age and rate of JH biosynthesis, but soldiers had significantly larger hypopharyngeal glands than did foragers, despite their similar age and JH level. Results from soldiers indicate that exocrine gland development is not always linked with age-related behavior and endocrine development; they also support the recent claim that soldiers constitute a group of older bees that are distinct from foragers. Hormonal analyses indicate that the current model of JH's role in honey bee division of labor needs to be expanded because high levels of JH are associated with several other tasks besides foraging. JH may be involved in the regulation of division of labor among similarly aged workers in addition to its role in age-related division of labor. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Corpora allata; Division of labor; Hypopharyngeal glands; Juvenile hormone; Social insects",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028446556

In an approach to this problem, we provided incubator-reared bees with opportunities to fly and see the sun only during the late afternoon. Then, on a cloudy day, we allowed bees to fly for the first time during the morning and early afternoon, and we observed how they oriented their waggle dances to indicate their direction of flight relative to the sun's position. The clouds denied the bees a direct view of celestial orientation cues and thus forced them to estimate the sun's position on the basis of their experience on previous evenings. During the test days, experience-restricted bees behaved during the entire morning as if they expected the sun to be in an approximately stationary position about 180° from the average solar azimuth that they had experienced on previous evenings; then from about local noon onward they used the evening azimuth. This pattern suggests that honeybees are innately informed of the general pattern of solar movement, such that they can generate an internal representation that incorporates spatial and temporal features of the sun's course that they have never directly seen.","learning; memory; navigation; orientation; spatial cognition",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028326436

Electromyogram activity released by severing the ventral nerve cord changed during the first few days of adult life but not later. Abdomens from older bees (nurses, guards, foragers) showed significantly higher EMG activity than newly emerged or 24 h-old bees. 2.

Varroa's reproductive cycle is tuned to that of drone cells, those mainly parasitized in the original host. We describe here how a single fertilized female, infesting a brood cell, can produce two to four adult fertilized females within the limited time span of bee development (270 h in worker and 320 h in drone cells), despite the disturbance caused by cocoon spinning and subsequent morphological changes of the bee. From observations on transparent artificial cells we were able to show how the mite combats these problems with specialized behaviors that avoid destruction by the developing bee, prepares a feeding site for the nymphs on the bee pupa, and constructs a fecal accumulation on the cell wall which serves as a rendezvous site for matings between its offspring. The proximity of the fecal accumulation to the feeding site facilitates feeding by the maturing progeny. However, communal use of the feeding site leads to competition between individuals, and protonymphs are most disadvantaged. This competition is somewhat compensated by the timing of oviposition by the mites. Use of a common rendezvous and feeding site by two or more Varroa mothers in multiinfested cells may have developed from the parental care afforded to them as nymphs. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Acari; Behavior; Parental care; Reproduction; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028175812

Within worker cells a considerable fraction of the mites do not produce offspring. It is investigated whether variation in the ratio of cells without reproduction is caused by properties of the worker brood, or by the state of the mites entering cells. Pieces of brood comb were taken from colonies of 12 different bee lines and were placed simultaneously into highly infested colonies. Non-reproduction was independent of the origin of the brood pieces, indicating a minor role of a variation due to different brood origin. Between colonies used for infestation, however, it differed considerably. A comparison of the proportion of cells without reproduction when infested by one Varroa mite or when infested by two or three Varroa mites showed, that non-reproduction was mainly related to the state of the mites entering cells, and only to a minor degree to an influence of the brood cells. A high ratio of worker cells without reproduction was consistently reported in bee lines which survive the disease without treatment, and a high level of non-reproduction is thus regarded to be a key factor in breeding bees for high Varroa tolerance. The current results indicate, that differences in this trait are only to a minor degree related to differences between bee lines in the ability of the bee brood to induce oviposition.

An increasing but controversial body of literature supports the views that: (1) Members of each subfamily within a colony can recognise each other, and distinguish supersisters from half-sisters. (2) Members of each subfamily use this recognition information and increase the reproductive fitness of their own subfamily at the expense of half-sisters through behaviour termed nepotism. A mathematical model is developed that shows that task specialisation by subfamilies, and bees that repeatedly undertake the behaviour within subfamilies, can influence the numbers of interactions among super-sisters, relative to the numbers of interactions between half-sisters. The model is then evaluated using a data set pertaining to trophallaxis behaviour in a two-subfamily colony. It is concluded that with this data set, task specialisation and subfamily recognition were indeed confounded, suggesting that the apparent subfamily recognition could easily have been an artefact of task specialisation. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Honey bee; Kin recognition; Nepotism; Supersisters; Trophallaxis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028176641

In the first experiment we test the prediction that individual pollen foragers from colonies with higher brood quantities should exhibit a greater work effort for pollen resources than individual pollen foragers from colonies with low brood quantities. Eight colonies were assigned into two treatment groups; HIGH brood colonies were manipulated to contain 9600±480 cm2 brood area; LOW brood colonies were manipulated to contain 1600±80 cm2 brood area. We measured colony brood levels over the course of the experiment and collected individual pollen loads from returning pollen foragers. We found that, while colonies remained significantly different in brood levels, individual pollen foragers from HIGH brood colonies collected larger loads than individuals from LOW brood colonies. In the second experiment we investigated the influence of colony size on the behaviour of individual nectar foragers. We assigned eight colonies to two treatment groups; LARGE colonies were manipulated to contain 35000±1700 adult workers with 3500±175 cm2 brood area, and SMALL colonies were manipulated to contain 10000±500 adult workers with 1000±50 cm2 brood area. We observed foraging trips of individually marked workers and found that individuals from LARGE colonies made longer foraging trips than those from SMALL colonies (LARGE: 1666.7±126.4 seconds, SMALL: 1210.8±157.6 seconds), and collected larter nectar loads (LARGE: 19.2±1.0 μl, SMALL: 14.6±0.8 μl). These results indicate that individual nectar foragers from LARGE colonies tend to work harder than individuals from SMALL colonies. Both experiments indicate that the values of nectar and pollen resources to a colony change depend on colony state, and that individual foragers modify their behaviour accordingly. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Colony state; Foraging behaviour; Honey bee",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027994989

To reach the feeder they either had to walk through 3 m of Teflon tube, or fly 20 m or 65 m and then walk through 3 m of tube. Only individuals that flew at least 65 m performed waggle dances. The distance indicated in these waggle dances, judged by the number of wagging movements per wagrun, was the same regardless of whether individuals had to run an additional 3 m of tube after flight or not. The energy needed during walking after flight was determined by measuring O2 consumption. All individuals attempted to regulate their body temperatures between 36 and 42°C during walking and feeding (O2 consumption=40μl·min-1 per bee). Calculations show that this walking through 3 m of tube requires as much energy as flying 128 m (difference between thoracic and ambient temperature=15°C). This energy expenditure was not reflected in the dances.

It may thus be possible to design low-molecular weight inhibitors targeted to the secretory form of mammalian PLA2. this enzyme has been implicated in inflammatory disorders. We have studied the inhibition of four distinct PLA2 enzymes by a range of NSAIDs, using3H-oleate release from prelabelled membranes of E. coli for assay. The enzymes used were cobra venom PLA2 (Naja naja, a group I enzyme), bee venom PLA2 (Apis mellifera, group III), recombinant human synovial PLA2 (group II) and rat peritoneal PLA2 (group II). Under the conditions of the3H-oleate E. coli assay, 1 m M concentrations of aspirin, sodium salicylate, paracetamol (acetaminophen), oxphenbutazone, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen and nabumetone failed to inhibit significantly any of the four enzymes. However, indomethacin inhibited all four enzymes, although effects were greatest on the two group II enzymes (rat peritoneal and human synovial PLA2). Approximate IC50 values were 28 and 35 μM, respectively. Inhibition by indomethacin was not time dependent and was greater at micromolar rather than millimolar levels of calcium. We conclude that indomethacin but not the other tested classes of NSAID inhibits the group II PLA2 enzyme in a selective manner and suggest that this may be relevant both to its clinical spectrum and to the design of novel pharmaceutical leads. © 1994 Birkhäuser Verlag.","Aspirin; Bee venom; Indomethacin; NSAIDs; Phospholipase A2",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028348851

In experiment 1, there were significant genotypic biases in the relative likelihood of rearing queens or workers, based on observations of individually labeled workers of known age belonging to two visually distinguishable subfamilies. In experiment 2, no genotypic biases in the relative likelihood of rearing drones or workers was detected, in the same colonies that were used in experiment 1. In experiment 3, there again were significant genotypic differences in the likelihood of rearing queens or workers, based on electrophoretic analyses of workers from a set of colonies with allozyme subfamily markers. There also was an overall significant trend for colonies to show greater subfamily differences in queen rearing when the queens were sisters (half- and super-sisters) rather than unrelated, but these differences were not consistent from trial to trial for some colonies. Results of experiments 1 and 3 demonstrate genotypic differences in queen rearing, which has been reported previously based on more limited behavioral observations. Results from all three experiments suggest that genotypic differences in brood care are influenced by social context and may be more pronounced when workers have a theoretical opportunity to practice nepotism. Finally, we failed to detect persistent interindividual differences in bees from either subfamily in the tendency to rear queen brood, using two different statistical tests. This indicates that the probability of queen rearing was influenced by genotypic differences but not by the effect of prior queen-rearing experience. These results suggest that subfamilies within a colony can specialize on a particular task, such as queen rearing, without individual workers performing that task for extended periods of time. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Division of labor; Genetics; Nepotism; Social insects",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028163450

These cells, one of a basal granular type and one of a vesicular type, are evenly distributed throughout the posterior three-quarters of the midgut. Each crypt complex contains one of each cell type, both of which may be derived from the same stem cells as the enterocytes. They already contain their respective secretory product while still in the nidus. Both reach the midgut lumen by a narrow apex and are therefore of the open type. The granular cells release their secretory granules at the cell base in a typical endocrine way. In young vesicular cells the secretory vesicles are released at the cell base and in the intercellular spaces. Old cells are still filled with vesicles when they are shed in the midgut lumen. This seems to indicate that these cells have both an endocrine (or paracrine) and an exocrine function, the latter apparently by holocrinc release. © 1994.","Apis mellifera (L.); granulated cells; gut endocrine cells; insect; Midgut; vesiculated cells",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028345543

A. mellifera visited significantly more flowers (mean, 164–193) than A. cerana (mean, 129–172) during single foraging trips at each site. There was no significant difference between the two species for number of flowers visited per minute. More bees of both species and at all sites foraged for pollen as ‘top workers’ in the morning than later in the day, when ‘side working’ (for nectar) was more prevalent. A. mellifera and A. cerana did not differ in the proportions of top or side worker bees at the three observation times, 09.00, 12.00 and 15.00 h. On average, more bees were seen foraging on sunny than on shady sides of trees but these differences were not significant at all sites. Both species at each location preferred to forage on trees nearer to their hives. Bees tended to move to trees located in different rows rather than in same rows, presumably because rows were oriented up and down slopes. Both species showed the same floral fidelity during pollination: bees in all orchards carried pollen loads that were more than 95% apple pollen. © 1994 International Bee Research Association.","Apis cerana; Apis mellifera; Apple; Foraging; Honey bees; India; Malus pumila",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028119046

There was no effect of the extracts on glucose or fructose titers. The decrease of glucose, fructose and trehalose titers during the time between taking blood samples in honeybees (because of starvation) had to be carefully monitored in order to detect the hypertrehalosemic effect of the extracts. Trehalose titers in unfed wasps on the other hand did not diminish during the time between blood sampling. In spite of large lipid stores in the fat body and a high blood lipid titer (15 mg/ml) in Polistes, there was a complete lack of hyperlipemic response to homologous injections of CC extracts.

For each experiment one or two otherwise comparable colonies was treated, and the effect on the rate of invasion was assessed. The results showed that the rate of invasion increases with the number of available brood cells, and decreases with the size of the honeybee population. This is expected when the rate of invasion is limited because the bees have to carry the mites close to a brood cell for invasion to occur, and only alimited number of honeybees can come close enough to a brood cell simultaneously. In addition, the rate of invasion decreased when young brood was present. This counterintuitive result may arise because the mites prefer young honeybees, young honeybees are likely to stay in the brood nest area, and young honeybees in the brood nest are divided over areas with brood cells that are suitable for invasion and over areas with brood cells that are unsuitable for invasion by mites. Hence, an increase in the amount of young brood, which is not yet suitable for invasion by mites, may decrease the invasion rate. Differences in the period during which brood cells suitable for mite invasion were available to the mites, appeared not to affect the rate of invasion. © 1994, Cambridge University Press.

Under in vitro conditions, octopamine and serotonin caused a dose-dependent stimulation of juvenile hormone release and increased intraglandular contents of juvenile hormone and its precursor methyl famesoate in prepupal glands. The octopamine analog synephrine was as potent as octopamine and serotonin, whereas dopamine and noradrenaline were ineffective. Octopamine- and serotonin-evoked responses were blocked by mianserin, ketanserin, and by the α-adrenergic receptor antagonist phentolamine. Gland activity was also increased by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, the effects of the two agents being additive. IBMX in the presence of a threshold concentration of octopamine (10-8 M) caused a potentiation of the octopamine effect on juvenile hormone release, indicating that the action of the biogenic amine is mediated by cAMP. Octopamine-induced increase in juvenile hormone production could not be reversed by washing out the biogenic amine, suggesting a longterm irreversible effect directly on corpora allata cells, possibly via cAMP. Accordingly, biogenic amines, in particular octopamine and serotonin, have to be considered as involved in the regulation of corpora allata activity during caste development of honey bees. © 1994.","Apis mellifera; Caste development; Corpora allata; Honey bee; Juvenile hormone; Octopamine; Serotonin",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028155789

Cotton pollen was collected by 16% of the landing foragers, pumpkin pollen (Cucurbita pepo) by 71%, and pollen of corn (Zea mays), pigweed (Amaranthus palmeri), and sunflower (Helianthus animus) were readily collected by nearly all foragers. The amount of time spent in the pollen dish was always short (1 to 9 seconds) and homogeneous among all pollen taxa, indicating that none of them was strongly repellent to the bees. The reduced effectiveness with which honey bees collected cotton pollen was demonstrated by the longer amount of time needed for pollen grooming and packing between two consecutive landings in the pollen dish and the small size of cotton pollen pellets (averages of 0.42 mg and 8.23 mg per pellet for cotton and com pollen, respectively). This reduced efficiency in cotton pollen collection was associated primarily with the length of the spines on cotton pollen which physically interfered with the pollen aggregating process used by honey bees. © 1994 Scandinavian University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028161687

On each day of the experiement the piece of brood comb was exchanged for a new one containing larvae of the age being tested. In dishes with no food only 5.5% of mites survived for two days. Survival of gravid female mites was significantly higher than that of thin females. On bee larvae 1, 3 and 3.5 days old, 0%, 9% and 47% of T. clareae females survived until the second day. None survived until the fourth day. However, on bee larvae four days old, 89%, 68%, 32%, 7% and 4% of females were alive on the 2nd, 5th, 10th, 19th and 28th day respectively. Thus, T. clareae females can survive for up to four weeks on bee larvae four days old. The amount of brood pheromones on larvae 4–5 days old is greater than that on younger larvae, probably stimulating feeding and thereby supporting mite survival. Fertilized female mites quickly become gravid, and they must enter cells containing bee larvae to lay eggs. T. clareae females do not need to feed on prepupae or pupae to lay eggs and to survive for longer periods. Queen honey bees need not be caged after brood removal from the colony in order to control the parasitic mite T. clareae, as by the time any eggs laid have developed into four-day-old larvae the mites will have died. © 1994 International Bee Research Association.","Apis mellifera; Honey bees; Larvae; Parasitism; Pheromones; Survival; Tropilaelaps clareae",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028141093

Royal jelly yields from a queenright hive design, in which a queen excluder partially covered with a hardboard division confined the queen to the bottom brood chamber and away from the queen cells in the middle box where royal jelly was secreted, were similar to those obtained from a queenless hive design in which the queen was removed to a nucleus box. This was despite the bees clustering around the queen cells in the queenright hive having smaller hypopharyngeal glands than those in the queenless starter hive. The queenright design is recommended because of its simplicity and ease of conversion in alternating between honey and royal jelly production. Harvesting 66 h after grafting larvae resulted in similar yields to harvesting at 72 h and 78 h, indicating that beekeepers can harvest at any time on the third day without affecting production. A technique which used two harvests per graft is not recommended. The chemical components of royal jelly within certain quality standards were not affected by the treatments.

Octopamine causes a dose-dependent increase in juvenile hormone release from corpora allata. Maximum increase is obtained with concentrations of 10-6 M in nurse and foraging bees by 45.3 or 32.3%, respectively. Octopamine-like immunoreactivity occurs in about 45 somata of the median neurosecretory cells in the pars intercerebralis of the bee brain. They project via immunopositive nervus corporis cardiaci I into the corpora cardiaca, where interspersed varicose structures and 8-10 cell bodies in the ventral part of this gland are stained. A network of immunoreactive fine varicose nerve fibres surrounds each gland cell of the corpora allata. Immunoreactivity in these neuronal structures is detectable if bees were starved over night, a condition in which corpora allata elicit the highest juvenile hormone production ever observed in bees. Both, the stimulatory effect of octopamine and the presence of immunoreactive nerve fibers in the corpora allata, strongly indicate a physiological role of this biogenic amine in the regulation of juvenile hormone biosynthesis in adult honey bees. © 1994.","Apis mellifera; Corpora allata; Corpora cardiaca; Immunocytochemistry; Juvenile hormone biosynthesis; Neurosecretory cells; Octopamine",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028026089

It would seem paradoxical if strong variability in learning performance persists even when those conditions are met. In the honey bee, learning about the relationship between floral odours and the rewards offered by flowers is important for colony survival. Yet several studies have identified a significant amount of inter-individual variability in olfactory learning performance among workers within colonies. This variability could be due to changes in learning performance due to age, to caste-specific alteration of motivational state, or to genotypic variability among paternal lines within colonies. Experiments reported herein were designed to establish the contribution of all three variables under controlled environmental conditions within which significant variability in a measure of learning performance exists. The results indicate that, at least under these conditions and when genotype is not manipulated, neither age nor caste had an effect on motivational state or learning performance. Genotype was the only variable that could account for a substantial portion of the variability within colonies of honey bees. Therefore, manipulation of genotype will be necessary in future studies designed to establish the reasons underlying variability in learning performance in natural populations. © 1994 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028165228

Studies include field visits to sites where bee mortality is recorded, examination of dead bees for disease, and analysis for the presence of pesticide residues. This paper reviews the results of these investigations for the period 1981-1991. Pesticide poisoning is diagnosed from the detection of residues in dead bees, through interpretation in relation to the median lethal dose (LD50), and 'subsequent residue level' (SRL) determined from laboratory studies in which bees were exposed to one LD50 dose. Overall, an annual average of 50 incidents were confirmed as due to pesticide poisoning, involving 30 pesticide active ingredients during the 1981-1991 period. In England and Wales, the principal hazards were caused by misuse of the insecticide triazophos on oilseed rape, a problem that has been reduced to low levels during the 1980s, and by dimethoate use on a variety of arable crops. In Scotland there were fewer incidents, most of which were associated with use of fenitrothion on raspberries, and gamma-HCH on oilseed rape. Opportunities for reducing the risks of poisoning, and for refining the investigation of suspected incidents, are discussed. © 1994.","honeybees; pesticides; poisoning",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028162063

Worker progeny were reared from queens originating from four sources: Australia, New Zealand, and two locations in British Columbia, Canada (Simon Fraser University and Vancouver Island). Progeny from New Zealand queens responded significantly higher (P < 0.05) than progeny from Australia in a QMP retinue bioassay. Retinue response was not related to queen production of pheromone or colony environment, and the strain-dependent differences in retinue bioassay responses were maintained over a wide range of dosages. Selected high- and low-responding colonies were bioassayed over the course of 1 year. High-responding colonies contacted QMP lures more frequently than low-responding colonies (P < 0.05) throughout the year except in late summer. We conclude that there is a strong genetic component to QMP response by worker honey bees, as well as a seasonal effect on response. © 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","Apis mellifera; honey bee; queen mandibular pheromone; retinue response",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028025754

The regenerative crypt is composed of stem cells and differentiating cells. The stem cells generate two forms of endocrine cells along with differentiating enterocytes of two distinct stages. At first they can be seen as light crypt cells which are not secretory active; they then develop into more electron dense, active secretory crypt cells. The developing enterocytes are arranged as tetrads, each composed of cells with the same degree of differentiation. This can be explained by the occurrence of cytoplasmic bridges between the cells of each tetrad. These fusomes are probably responsible for the apparent intercellular coordination. This is a new example of intercellular bridges between somatic cells and, as far as we know the first description of fusomes in the insect midgut epithelium. The microvilli on top of the crypt cells develop within a spherical extracellular space where glycosaminoglycans are secreted. This occurs by the coordinated activity of the four surrounding electron dense crypt cells. Microvilli formation therefore seems to be the first in a series of successive functions of honeybee enterocytes during their ontogeny. © 1994.","Apis mellifera; hymenoptera; intercellular bridges; microvilli formation; Midgut",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028263126

Readiness to sting, a component of defensive behaviour, was quantified in a laboratory assay of individual worker honey bees from two colonies (one gentle, one defensive) by measuring their response thresholds to electrical stimulation which elicited stinging. At all ages, workers from the gentle colony had a higher response threshold, and therefore stung less readily, than workers from the defensive colony. Assaying of bees which had emerged in an incubator and which were then home-fostered into their natal colony or cross-fostered into the other colony allowed the relative importance of self-genotype and within-colony environment on stinging behaviour to be measured. Cross-fostered bees completely modified their readiness to sting to that of the majority of the bees in their host colony; the expression of self-genotype was masked by within-colony environment, which was all-important in dictating stinging behaviour. The response threshold varied with age and was at a minimum around 20 days of age, probably corresponding with the age of guarding and defence tasks prior to and overlapping with the initiation of foraging. Modification of an individual’s defensive behaviour by within-colony environment and its change with age should be incorporated into models of colony defence. © 1994 International Bee Research Association.","Age; Apis mellifera; Colony defence; Genotype environment interaction; Honey bees; Stinging",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027995132

The estimated number of stings received by each patient ranged from 200 to 1000. All five were transferred to intensive care units in So Paulo City. Clinical features included intravascular haemolysis, respiratory distress with ARDS, hepatic dysfunction, rhabdo-myolysis (with myoglobinaemia and myoglobinuria), hypertension and myocardial damage (perhaps explained by release of endogenous catecholamines by venom phospholipase A2 and mellitin), shock, coma, acute renal failure and bleeding. Laboratory findings included gross neutrophil leucocytosis, elevated serum enzymes [AST, ALT, LDH, CPK (predominantly CPK-MM)] and creatinine. Clotting times were slightly prolonged. Despite treatment with antihistamines, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, vasodilators, bicarbonate, mannitol and mechanical ventilation, three of the patients died between 22 and 71 h after the attacks, with histopathological features of ARDS, hepatocellular necrosis, acute tubular necrosis, focal subendocardial necrosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Whole bee venom and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) antigen concentrations were measured in serum and urine for the first time, using enzyme immunoassay. High venom and PLA2concentrations were detected in serum and urine for more than 50 h after the stings in two fatal cases, in one of which the total circulating unbound whole venom was estimated at 27 mg, one hour after the attack.

Dans la zone tropicale humide forestière guinéo-congolaise et intermédiaire guinéo-congolaise/soudanienne, les abeilles sont très sélectives dans leur choix; elles privilégient les sommets très fleuris des frondaisons proches des ruches où elles recherchent les gros fournisseurs de nectar parmi les espèces melittophiles de préférence. Quelques rares taxons anémophiles porteurs de miellat (Celtis) sont localement visités. Au sein de ces forêts, le comportement d’affouragement des abeilles varie peu quelque soit la saison. Dans les zones plus sèches soudaniennes ou semi-arides de savane et dans les régions méditerranéennes ou intermédiaires sahéliennes et méditerranéennes, les abeilles apparaissent moins sélectives et exploitent une très large proportion de la flore mélittophile ou amphiphile disponible, ainsi qu’une proportion plus élevée d’anémophiles à miellat, surtout en région méditerranéenne. En savane, le comportement de butinage varie suivant les saisons: La strate arborescente est principalement visitée au cours de la saison sèche tandis que celle herbacée en fleur est exploitée durant la saison humide. Le rythme des successions des floraisons est ainsi perceptible dans la composition pollinique des miels. En zone méditerranéenne, la strate herbacée est celle qui fournit le plus de nectar, à l’exception de certaines essences introduites, comme les Eucalyptus en fin de saison des pluies/début de saison sèche. En zone humide forestière, de nombreux arbres prèsentent de grandes fleurs colorées odoriférantes produisant de grandes quantités de nectar au cours des deux saisons. Au contraire, en zone méditerranénenne, la plupart des fleurs nectarifères portées par des herbacées sont petites et donnent peu de nectar. Dès lors, les abeilles sont obligées d’élargir leur champ de butinage. La composition floristique des miels ne reflète réellement la structure de la végétation que dans le cas des régions sèches où les abeilles exploitent l’ensemble de la végétation. En revanche dans les régions tropicales humides forestières ou de savane arborée, le spectre pollinique des miels ne correspond qu’aux formations végétales entourant les ruches parfois représentatives des grands types de végétation de la région. Seules alors les endémiques ou certaines associations spécifiques permettent une bonne typification des miels. Le degré de sélectivité des abeilles vis à vis de la flore ne paraît être influencé que par la morphologie florale, la phénologie et les facteurs climatiques les conditionnant ainsi que par la longueur de la langue. The pollen analysis presented here concern about 130 honey samples from six vegetation zones from Morocco to the Gulf of Guinea. They illustrate the principal differences in foraging behaviour between four bee races of Apis mellifera (adansonii and sahariensis with a long tongue; intermedia and major with a short tongue). In the tropical rain forest guineo-congolian and intermediate guineo-congolian/sudanian regions, the bees are very selective in their choice. They favour near the hives the richly flowering forest canopy of honey-producing entomophilous species. Some rare anemophilous taxons with honeydew (Celtis) are localy visited. In such forest, the foraging behaviour is not very different between dry or wet season. In the drier soudanian or semi-arid savannah and in the mediterrenean and intermediate sahelian and mediterranean zones the bees sem less selective and gather on a very large part of the melittophilous or other available species. They also gather on a high proportion of anemophilous species with honeydew, in particular in mediterranean regions. In savannah country the foraging varies with the seasons, the forest stratum is principaly visited during the dry season and the herbaceous stratum during the wet season. The rhythm of successive flowering is thus visible in the honey pollen spectra. In the mediterranean region the herbaceous stratum produces most of the nectar with the exception of some introduced species like Eucalyptus at the end of the wet season/beginning of the dry season. In wet forest zone many trees have large fragrant and highly coloured flowers producing abundant nectar. On the other hand, the nectariferous flowers, small and containing little nectar are found on herbaceous plants in the mediterranean region. Here the bees need to extend widely their gathering area. Consequently the pollen spectra of the honey correspond to the composition of the vegetation only in the dry regions where the bees exploit all available species. In contrast, in tropical rainforest or tree-savannah regions the pollen spectrum of the honey agrees only with the vegetation formation in the vicinity of the hives, sometimes representative of the major vegetation types of the region. Only endemics or certain species associations allow a clear identification of the honeys. The degree of selectivity of the bees is only influenced by floral morphology, phenology, climatic factors and the length of the tongue. It appears independant of the morphology and the race of the insects. This explains why bees adapt so well their foraging behaviour to major vegetation types as this can be seen in the America where they were introduced. © 1994 Scandinavian Unhenity Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000783029

This paper investigates the relationship between NADPHd and the NO‐producing enzyme NO synthase (NOS) in neuronal tissue of Apis and Drosophila, two insects used for studying learning. First, the NOS and the NADPHd in both species were characterized biochemically. The fixation‐insensitive NADPHd activity, which accounts for the staining in NADPHd histochemistry, co‐purifies with the insect Ca2+/calmodulin‐dependent NOS. Formation of NO from l‐arginine depends on NADPH, and half‐maximal stimulation is observed with 0.3 μM Ca2+. NOS is competitively inhibited by methyll‐arginine and nitro‐l‐arginine, with Kiof 1.7 and 1.9 μM, respectively. The co‐purification and the competitive inhibition of NOS by the NADPHd substrate, nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT), are proof that in insects the enzyme responsible for fixation‐insensitive NADPHd activity is nitric oxide synthase. Second, the NOS activity was quantified in distinct neuropiles and the NO‐producing neuropiles were visualized using NADPHd histochemistry. In both species the highest NOS activity is found in the chemosensory neuropiles of the antenna1 lobes, intermediate activity in the neuropiles of the central brain and by far the lowest NOS activity in the visual neuropiles. Although in both species the Kenyon cell somata of the mushroom bodies show no detectable staining, the neuropiles of the mushroom bodies of Drosophila and Apis show a distinct staining. The staining pattern of NOS in both species is different to that of all known neurotransmitters. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

Pollination of flowers by field-bees and the development of colonies used for pollination in confined environments are closely related. The structural characteristics and the type of covering of the artificial environment, as well as the time when the colony is placed in situ and the length of the residences often influence the activity and survival of these insects. Observations made during the period of strawberry blossom have shown the possibility of colony adaptation to particular semicircular tunnels and plastic film covered greenhouses with side openings. Colonies with small numbers of adults and brood cells adapted better than stronger ones to protected conditions over a 3-week period. Colony growth was inversely proportional to the initial size of the nucleus. Among factors inhibiting flight and colony development was relative humidity above 80%, which causes the protozoon Nosema apis to proliferate, giving rise to nosemiasis. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Confined environment; Honey bees; Insect behaviour",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33847189564

Africanized honeybees can be differentiated from honeybees of European ancestry using discriminant analysis of morphological characters, based on a minimum of ten intact specimens per colony. In this paper we report a PCR-based method suitable for the identification of African or European mtDNA from sting remnants, such as typically remain on victims following a stinging incident. We experimentally simulated collection and shipment conditions with dried and alcohol preservation of stings, and also report that the method was suitable for sting remnants stored with a victim sample for over one year in alcohol. The determination of mtDNA haplotypes from stinger remnants must be tempered by the constraints inherent in interpretation of mtDNA haplotype data. Such data do not provide any information regarding the genetic contribution of the paternal lineage. However, in geographic areas where baseline information regarding European haplotype frequencies is known, the detection of a different mtDNA haplotype in stingers from a victim, especially when associated with observations of extreme defensive behaviour, would certainly be suggestive of Africanization. © 1994, Cambridge University Press.

A survey of the data that tests whether such discrimination takes place shows that, despite substantial effort in a number of laboratories, there is no conclusive evidence for intracolony discrimination in any of the postulated contexts. The strongest suggestive data is in the critical context of queen rearing, but flaws in experimental design or analysis make the best available tests inconclusive. We present new data that shows that cues exist on which discriminations can be made among adult workers in nestmate recognition interactions and in feeding interactions, but our data does not differentiate between subfamily recognition and recognition associated with color phenotypes.

By using microsatellites, we directly identified the 7-20 subfamilies (patrilines) present in five honeybee colonies belonging to three different subspecies (Apis mellifera mellifera, A.m. carnica and A. m. ligustica). By focusing further investigations on one A.m. mellifera colony, we showed that the genetic structure remained largely unchanged over time as long as the colony is headed by the same queen. The genetic diversity within the colony also provided a good estimate of the genetic diversity of the local honeybee population. The distribution of patrilines was significantly different in swarming workers compared with contemporaneous pupae of the original colony, probably due to unequal propensities for swarming among patrilines. Conversely, no bias in the relative proportions between worker and queen brood could be detected.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027997119

In colour dimorphic flower patches, bees visited both flower colours extensively when caloric values of rewards were equivalent; some individuals randomly foraged with respect to colour while many bees showed various degrees of preference. When ‘nectar’ caloric rewards differed between flower morphs, bees switched to the flower colour with the greater reward irrespective of flower patch colour dimorphism. Energy maximization (calories/time) was a robust predictor of A. cerana behaviour with respect to the sugar types. The foraging behaviour of A. cerana differed from that reported for A. mellifera. Although both species foraged in accordance with predictions of an energy maximization model on blue-white dimorphic flower patches, individual constancy was not observed for A. cerana on blue-yellow dimorphic flower patches as reported for A. mellifera. Models based upon Apis social structure, caste system, morphology, and domestication were unable to account for this interspecific difference. However, species-related forager size and colony size differences were correlated with the observed results. These correlations suggest that work partitioning which minimizes forager interference may be more important to A mellifera than to A cerana, and that the species may base foraging actions on different initial perceptions of ‘same’ and ‘different’ when viewing a floral dimorphism. © 1994 International Bee Research Association.","Apis cerana; Apis mellifera; Foraging; Honey bees; Sugars",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028251276

The behaviour and activity patterns of Apis mellifera and of five species of Bombus were analysed in relation to climatic variables and nectar quality on three varieties of unsprayed cultivated raspberry (Rubus idaeus) in eastern Scotland. Stages of floral morphology and reward were similar for the three varieties: young flowers offered both nectar and pollen, but medium and old flowers offered nectar only, in diminishing quantities. A wide range of insects visited raspberry flowers, but bees were dominant, bumblebees being responsible for about 60% of all visits and honeybees making up most of the remaining percentage. All bees had substantial pollen deposited on their bodies during visits, though few specifically collected it. Bombus spp. were found to favour young (receptive) flowers strongly, especially early in the morning when pollen was most abundant: whilst Apis visited unselectively. Bumblebees also foraged over substantially longer periods of the day, and in poorer weather, some being present at most times of observation; and they foraged more quickly in terms of flower visits per minute. Bombus carried more pollen on their bodies than Apis, and also deposited more pollen on raspberry stigmas, with B.lapidarius and B.terrestris being particularly effective and also being the most abundant species. All bumblebees also foraged over a longer range, moving between canes and rows more frequently than did honeybees. Bumblebees are therefore likely to be substantially more important as pollinators of raspberries than are honeybees, especially as raspberries though moderately self‐fertile may exhibit metaxenia. Reasons why Bombus may be the preferred pollinator in most sites of raspberry cultivation are discussed, together with implications for present and future growers. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

This hypothesis was tested using a paradigm, in which forager bees were temporarily made to fly stationarily in a wind tunnel on their way to and from the feeding site, so that information about the way to the feeding site, but not the information about the location of the food source, was experimentally influenced.

As the number of mites per cell increased, a clear decrease in the reproductive rate was observed from about three offspring per mite at 1 mite/cell to one offspring per mite at 6 mites/cell. There was also a decrease in the number of females reaching the adult stage. Parasitic intensity. was highest (up to 6 mites/cell) in winter and lowest in summer (up to 2 mites/cell). As the number of male offspring produced was not affected, changes in the sex ratio were observed. At a parasitic intensity of 1 mite/cell, there were 38.7% males in the offspring, but at 6 mites/cell the proportion of males was 51.3%. During winter, a lower number of brood cells were available resulting in a high proportion of highly infested cells and a reduced reproductive rate.

Fifteen bees were given binary choices between artificial flowers that varied in depth and in volume of sucrose-water delivered. Three bees violated weak stochastic transitivity, under an assumption about the order in which the flowers ranked along a utility scale; they preferred flower A to flower B, B to C, C to D, but D to A. These bees also violated strong stochastic transitivity, which focuses on the strength rather than the direction of preference. An intransitive pattern of choice supports the hypothesis of 'comparative' evaluation of flowers, where options are compared along their different dimensions, each dimension separately. Intransitivities cannot be explained by an 'absolute' model, where each option is evaluated independently and assigned a fixed value (utility). Twelve of the bees made choices that were consistent with both absolute and comparative models of decision making. In light of the above results it is suggested that the assumption that animals employ an absolute method of decision making be reconsidered, and perhaps supplemented with a comparative account.

Variations were observed in the flowers’ opening time, with the early-opening plants beginning to open two hours before sunset, and the late-opening plants opening close to sunset. Flowers were visited only by day-active insects: the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and the carpenter bee (Xylocopa pubescens). The visitors’ behavior indicated that they were involved in pollination. Early-opening flowers were visited both in the evening and in the morning, whereas late-openers were visited only in the morning. C. peruvianus was found to be self-incompatible, and fruit set did not occur when flowers were hand self-pollinated. Hand cross-pollination resulted in very high fruit set (92%) and heavy fruits with a high seed number. Fruit set, seed number, and fruit weight were lower in open-pollination than in hand cross-pollination.

Mites collected from young bees in an Apis mellifera carnica colony were used in the tests, which employed wax tubes incorporating the test substances. During a test, mites could remain in a tube containing a test substance or move from it into a tube of pure wax without the test substance. Twenty-two out of 32 tested ethereal oils had a clear repellent effect on the mites. Oil of clove and oil of cinnamon proved to be the only ones with a clear attractant effect on the mites. The most pronounced repellent effect was caused by oil of citronella. Oil of marjoram was clearly capable of masking odours. In toxicity tests, most of the tested oils caused a distinct increase in mortality of mites which were exposed to them incorporated in wax at a concentration of 0.1 %. The other tested ethereal oils caused an increase in mite mortality at a concentration of 1.0% or more. The repellents oil of marjoram and oil of citronella, and the attractant oil of clove, were mixed into the comb foundation wax of test colonies. The infestation rates of V. jacobsoni in capped brood cells was clearly higher in colonies with oil of clove foundation than in control colonies with normal foundation. The infestation rate was only slightly lower in colonies with oil of citronella, but clearly lower in colonies with oil of marjoram foundation, than in control colonies. This result indicates that a treatment with oil of marjoram might be a way to decrease the population growth of this parasite. © 1994 International Bee Research Association.","Apis mellifera; Attractants; Essential oils; Honey bees; Orientation; Repellents; Toxicity; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-21844512299

From stages 8- to 15 H and H, Sax1 continues to be expressed only in the spinal part of the neural plate. The anterior border of Sax1 expression was found to be always in the transverse plane separating the youngest somite from the yet unsegmented mesodermal plate and to regress with similar dynamics to that of the segregation of the somites from the mesodermal plate. The posterior border of Sax1 expression coincides with the posterior end of the neural plate. In order to study a possible regulation of Sax1 expression by its neighboring tissues, several embryonic manipulation experiments were performed. These manipulations included: removal of somites, mesodermal plate or notochord and transplantation of a young ectopic notochord in the vicinity of the neural plate or transplantation of neural plate sections into the extraembryonic area. The results of these experiments revealed that the induction of the neural plate by the mesoderm has already occurred in full primitive streak embryos, after which Sax1 is autonomously regulated within the spinal part of the neural plate.","Chicken embryo; Expression; Homeobox; Notochord; Sax1 (CHox3); Spinal cord",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028180293

The foraging worker honey bee from a colony deprived of food should prefer to feed on variable flowers. Individual bees were given repeated binary choices between variable (10% and 30% mg solute/mg solution) and constant (20% mg solute/mg solution) sucrose concentrations delivered in plastic flower tubes of different colours. Sucrose concentration, rather than sucrose volume, was varied so that bees feeding on either constant or variable flowers would experience equal mean sucrose concentrations (20%) and nearly identical (on average within 0·04 J/s) net rates of energy gain. Honey combs were removed or added to a colony to alter the colony's energy state. There was no difference between the preferences of bees from colonies with large amounts of honey and those from colonies with small amounts of honey. Fifty-three per cent of the 9775 flower visits made by 40 bees were to constant flowers. Because of the large number of foraging bees in the colony and the large number of flower visits that individual honey bees make during each foraging trip, the colony achieves close to the true mean of variable resources.

The HIV-1 gp120 gene with its natural signal sequence expressed in any prokaryotic or eukaryotic expression systems showed extremely low levels of synthesis and secretion. However, deletion of the HIV-1 gp 120 signal sequence results in production of large quantities of a nonglycosylated form of gp120 in Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Substitution of the gp120 natural signal sequences with the signal sequences from honeybee mellitin or murine interleukin 3 promotes a high level of expression of a glycosylated form of gp120 and efficient secretion. These heterologous signal sequences contain one (mellitin) or no (IL-3) positively charged amino acids and led us to investigate the role of the positively charged amino acids in the signal sequence of HIV-1 gp120. Four charge-altered forms of the gp120 signal sequence of HIV-1 were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis in which the positively charged amino acids were sequentially substituted with neutral amino acids. The results of these experiments showed that the expression and secretion of gp120 was progressively increased by eliminating the positively charged amino acids in a stepwise fashion. However, the substitution of all positively charged amino acids resulted in the accumulation of nonglycosylated gp120 within the cells with decreased amounts of the glycosylated form of gp120. These results demonstrate that the positively charged amino acids in the signal sequence of HIV-1 gp120 are key factors in determining its poor expression and secretion. Analyses of intracellular transport and folding of gp120 further indicate that the presence of a highly charged, uncleaved signal sequence is an important factor limiting transport of gp120 from the rough ER to the Golgi apparatus. © 1994 Academic Press.

Nearly all hexokinase activity was found in the cytosolic fraction, following a similar distribution as the cytosolic enzymatic marker, phosphoglycerate kinase. The distribution of enzymatic markers of mitochondria (succinate dehydrogenase, rotenone‐insensitive cytochrome c reductase, and adenylate kinase) indicated that the outer mitochondrial membrane was partly damaged, but their distributions were different from that of hexokinase. The activity of hexokinase in purified suspensions of cells was fivefold higher in glial cells than in photoreceptors. This result is consistent with the hypothesis based on quantitative 2‐deoxy[3H]glucose autoradiography that only glial cells phosphorylate significant amounts of glucose to glucose‐6‐phosphate. The activities of alanine aminotransferase and to a lesser extent of glutamate dehydrogenase were higher in the cytosolic than in the mitochondrial fraction. This important cytosolic activity of glutamate dehydrogenase was consistent with the higher activity found in mitochondria‐poor glial cells. In conclusion, this distribution of enzymes is consistent with the model of metabolic interactions between glial and photoreceptor cells in the intact bee retina. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

Pollination was prevented by covering plants with floating row covers at the time of first female flowering. Plants were left covered for either 6 or 12 days and then exposed to honey bee visitation. Cultivars used in the 1992 season were Cruiser, Explorer and Primo. Cruiser, Mission and Primo were used in 1993. Twelve colonies of honey bees were placed on the border of the test plots in 1992 and two in 1993. In 1992, Primo plants which had pollination delayed for six days produced heavier fruits and a greater total fruit weight per plant than those not delayed or delayed 12 days. Cruiser and Explorer produced smaller fruits when pollination was delayed 12 days but were unaffected by a 6-day delay. In 1993, Mission delayed for 12 days produced more fruits per plant. No differences in fruit quality (percentage culls, soluble solid content and size) or number were observed in other cultivars when pollination was delayed. In both trials, the median harvest time was about the same as controls when pollination was delayed for six days. These results suggest that the time honey bee colonies need to be in the field for cantaloupe pollination could be reduced. Pollination could be delayed by about one week without negatively affecting productivity or harvest time. This would provide growers additional time in which to apply insecticides should they be needed, and reduce honey bee exposure to insecticides. © 1994 International Bee Research Association.","Apis mellifera; Cantaloupes; Cucumis melo; Honey bees; Melons; Pollination; Productivity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028119047

In addition, pollen from Cistaceae species collected throughout 1986 by two honey bee colonies placed near Hinojos was studied. Observations were also made on the presence of Cistaceae pollen in honey produced during the same year by these colonies. The flowering phenology and nectar and pollen production of the species of Cistus and Halimium found in Hinojos in that period were also recorded. The results show that the apicultural value of the Cistaceae in W Andalusia is limited to the genus Cistus, particularly the species C. ladanifer, C. crispus, C. albidus, C. monspeliensis and C. salvifolius. The importance of each of these species for apiculture varies throughout this territory. In all the Cistaceae species studied, the bulk of the flowering occurred during spring. The period of greatest pollen collection from each species coincided with that of its peak flowering, but pollen grains of these taxa were present in honey produced well outside the flowering periods of these species. Both Cistus and Halimium flowers had very high pollen production but only those of Cistus secreted nectar, with high concentrations of sugar (> 70%). The results suggest that in W Andalusia honey bees visit Cistus flowers mostly to collect pollen. © 1994 International Bee Research Association.","Apis mellifera; Cistaceae; Cistus; Halimium; Honey bee forage; Honey bees; Melissopalynology; Nectar; Phenology; Pollen; Pollen analysis; Pollen plants; Spain",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047695182

Box 475, Canberra, A.C.T., 2601, Australia","The biology of honeybees predisposes them to learn the colours and shapes of food-bearing flowers rapidly. Consequently, bees have been a very attractive organism in which to study the visual processes by which patterns are learned and recognized. Early research, carried out with patterns presented on a horizontal surface, suggested that bees distinguish between different patterns purely on the basis of the temporal frequency of intensity fluctuations (flicker) that the eyes experience as the bee flies over the patterns. Later work, in which patterns were presented in the vertical plane, indicated that bees are capable of distinguishing between patterns by acquiring a ""photographic"" image, or template, of the pattern at which they receive a reward. According to this hypothesis, the bee's ability to distinguish between patterns depends upon the extent to which each pattern overlaps with, or matches the stored template. Recently, evidence has been accumulating to suggest that bees are also capable of learning patterns without memorizing them in a literal fashion. For example, bees can abstract a general property of a pattern, such as its orientation, and use this property to distinguish between other patterns which they have never previoulsy encountered. It now appears that some of the mechanisms by which bees analyse visual patterns may not be very different, qualitatively, from those known to exist in the cortex of higher vertebrates. © 1994.","Honeybee; Insect; Memory; Orientation; Vision",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028162779

Mudd Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14853, New York, United States","Forager honey bees function not only as gatherers of food for their colonies, but also as sensory units shaped by natural selection to gather information regarding the location and profitability of forage sites. They transmit this information to colony members by means of waggle dances. To investigate the way bees transduce the stimulus of nectar-source profitability into the response of number of waggle runs, I performed experiments in which bees were stimulated with a sucrose solution feeder of known profitability and their dance responses were videorecorded. The results suggest that several attributes of this transduction process are adaptations to enhance a bee's effectiveness in reporting on a forage site. (1) Bees register the profitability of a nectar source not by sensing the energy gain per foraging trip or the rate of energy gain per trip, but evidently by sensing the energetic efficiency of their foraging. Perhaps this criterion of nectar-source profitability has been favored by natural selection because the foraging gains of honey bees are typically limited by energy expenditure rather than time availability. (2) There is a linear relationship between the stimulus of energetic efficiency of foraging and the response of number of waggle runs per dance. Such a simple stimulus-response function appears adequate because the range of suprathreshold stimuli (max/min ratio of about 10) is far smaller than the range of responses (max/min ratio of about 100). Although all bees show a linear stimulus-response function, there are large differences among individuals in both the response threshold and the slope of the stimulus-response function. This variation gives the colony a broader dynamic range in responding to food sources than if all bees had identical thresholds of dance response. (3) There is little or no adaptation in the dance response to a strong stimulus (tonic response). Thus each dancing bee reports on the current level of profitability of her forage site rather than the changes in its profitability. This seems appropriate since presumably it is the current profitability of a forage site, not the change in its profitability, which determines a site's attractiveness to other bees. (4) The level of forage-site quality that is the threshold for dancing is tuned by the bees in relation to forage availability. Bees operate with a lower dance threshold when forage is sparse than when it is abundant. Thus a colony utilizes input about a wide range of forage sites when food is scarce, but filters out input about low-reward sites when food is plentiful. (5) A dancing bee does not present her information in one spot within the hive but instead distributes it over much of the dance floor. Consequently, the dances for different forage sites are mixed together on the dance floor. This helps each bee following the dances to take a random sample of the dance information, which is appropriate for the foraging strategy of a honey bee colony since it is evidently designed to allocate foragers among forage sites in proportion to their profitability. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Communication; Foraging; Honey bee; Sensory biology; Waggle dance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028163437

Cord plasma had significantly lower vitamin E (P < 0.0001) compared with maternal plasma. Whole blood clotting time of cord blood was significantly (P < 0.002) shorter compared with the clotting time of maternal blood. There was a significant correlation between plasma vitamin E and whole blood clotting time (r = 0.54, P < 0.04) of cord blood. The addition of standard vitamin E to cord blood in vitro resulted in prolongation of whole blood clotting time. This suggests that a deficiency of plasma vitamin E can shorten whole blood clotting time in newborns, which may have a role in the disseminated intravascular coagulation frequently experienced by newborn infants. © 1994.","Newborn infants; Vitamin E; Whole blood clotting time",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028343178

In one model bees were induced to sting the shaved skin of anesthetized rabbits. The stings were removed from the skin at various time intervals after autotomization, and residual venom was assayed with a hemolytic method. In the other model the bees were induced to sting preweighed filter paper disks, which were weighed again after removal of the sting at various intervals. Results of both experiments were in agreement, showing that at least 90% of the venom sac contents were delivered within 20 seconds and that venom delivery was complete within 1 minute. The data suggest that a bee sting must be removed within a few seconds after autotomization to prevent anaphylaxis in an allergic person.

We now report that thioredoxin, reduced either enzymically with NADPH and NADP-thioredoxin reductase or chemically with dithiothreitol or lipoic acid, acts as a specific reductant of purified snake venom neurotoxins, a diverse group of disulfide proteins. Included were Bungarus multicinctus neurotoxins that act presynaptically (β-bungarotoxin) or postsynaptically (α-bungarotoxin) as well as a postsynaptic neurotoxin from Laticauda semifasciata (erabutoxin b). We also observed a thioredoxin-specific reduction with other disulfide proteins of venom from Bungarus multicinctus, scorpion (Androctonus australis), and bee (Apis mellifera). Other cellular sulfhydryl agents, glutathione and glutaredoxin, were uniformly inactive. Thioredoxins from bacterial, plant, and animal sources were all active in neurotoxin reduction, but differed in effectiveness. Reduction of the neurotoxins by thioredoxin was accompanied by an increased susceptibility to tryptic proteolysis and a decrease of associated toxin activity: Phospholipase A2 (β-bungarotoxin, snake, and bee venoms) or acetylcholine receptor binding (α-bungarotoxin). These findings extend the function of thioredoxin to the reduction of a broad group of low-molecular-weight proteins, all containing intramolecular disulfide bonds. The loss of activity accompanying reduction raises the possibility that venoms may be detoxified by thioredoxin either as a defense mechanism or as a clinical antidote. © 1994 Academic Press, Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028352446

Francesco di Sales 2, Gallina, Reggio Calabria, 89061, Italy","The role played by beekeeping within agrarian and natural ecosystems is analyzed, in relation to honey production and, above all, to bees as pollinators. In natural ecosystems, pollinating insects belonging to Lepidoptera, Cole-optera, Diptera and Hymenoptera carry out pollen transport in a great number of plants, belonging to several families (Liliaceae, Cruciferae, Rosaceae, Legumino-sae, Compositae, etc.)- In particular, the spread of Leguminosae, which is helped by wild Apoidea and by Apis mellifera L., creates a symbiosis between these plants and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, with a consequent increase in soil fertility. Agrarian ecosystems are extremely unfavourable to wild pollinators, due to crop specialization and the consequent biotic simplification. Pollination is ensured, both in self-sterile and self-fertile plants, by honey-bees, which may be easily bred and subsequently transported. This leads to an appreciable increase in production, which is roughly estimated in Italy to be of about 2,000 billion lire. By contrast, honey and all the other beekeeping products (wax, pollen, royal jelly, propolis), though representing the economic basis of apiarian farms, give a total profit of about 30 billion lire. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Biotic pollination; Entomogamous cultivated species; Honeybee; Melliferous flora",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1042275685

Compared with the cyt b genes from Apis mellifera, Drosophila melanogaster, and D. yakuba, the overall A + T content (A + T%) of that of T. rufoniger is lower (69.9% vs 80.7%, 74.2%, and 73.9%, respectively) than those of the other three. The codon usage in the cyt b gene of T. rufoniger is biased although not as much as in A. mellifera, D. melanogaster, and D. yakuba; T. rufoniger has eight unused codons whereas D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, and A. mellifera have 21, 20, and 23, respectively. The inferred cyt b polypeptide chain (PPC) of T. rufoniger has diverged at least as much from a common ancestor with D. yakuba as has that of A. mellifera (∼3.5 vs ∼2.9). Despite the lower A + T%, the relative frequencies of amino acids in the cyt b PPC of T. rufoniger are significantly (P < 0.05) associated with the content of adenine and thymine (A + T%) and size of codon families. The mitochondrially located cytochrome oxidase subunit 11 genes (CO-II) of endopterygote insects have significantly higher average A + T% (∼75%) than those of exopterygous (∼69%o) and paleopterous (∼69%) insects. The increase in A + T% of endopterygote insects occurred in Upper Carboniferous and coincided with a significant acceleration of PPC divergence. However, acceleration of PPC divergence is not significantly correlated with the increase of the A + T% (P > 0.1). The high A + T%, the biased codon usage, and the increased PPC divergence of Hymenoptera can in that respect most easily be explained by directional mutation pressure which began in the Upper Carboniferous and still occurs in most members of the order. Given the roughly identical A + T% of the cyt b and CO-II genes from the other insects whose DNA sequences are known (A. mellifera, D. melanogaster, and D. yakuba), it seems most likely that the A + T% of T. rufoniger declined secondarily within the last 100 Myr as a result of a reduced directional mutation pressure. © 1994, Springer-Verlag New York Inc.

In honeybees, polyspermic fertilization occurs, and many spermatozoa, including their mitochondria-rich flagellum, can completely penetrate the egg, thus allowing for a possibly high paternal leakage. In order to identify paternal mtDNA in honeybee eggs, restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of different subspecies were used. Total DNA extracts of different developmental stages of an Apis mellifera carnica x Apis mellifera capensis hybrid brood were tested with a radioactively-labelled diagnostic mtDNA probe. Densitograms of autoradiographs indicated that the male contribution represents up to 27% of the total mitochondrial DNA in the fertilized eggs 12 h after oviposition. In subsequent developmental stages the portion of paternal mtDNA slowly decreased until hatching of the larvae when only traces were found. Although rapid disintegration of paternal mtDNA does not occur, the initially high paternal mitochondrial contribution is not maintained in the adult animal. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Fertilization; Mitochondrial DNA; Paternal inheritance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027764620

We established a colony into which we placed individually marked workers from three genetically distinct groups. The colony was placed in an enclosure that contained feeding stations with pollen and sugar syrup. Foraging resources, stores of pollen and the quantity of brood within the colony were varied temporally. Individual foragers switched between resource types in response to changes in relative resource quality and colony need, demonstrating flexibility in resource choice at the individual level. However, genetic groups within the colony varied in their tendency to collect pollen versus nectar, and in lability of response to changes in foraging stimuli. Our data suggest that within-colony genotypic diversity contributes to a resilient foraging response to environmental variation. © 1993 Birkhäuser Verlag Basel.","division of labor; genotypic diversity; Honey bee; nectar foraging; pollen foraging",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027787469

Binding sites for the two amines are also present in most brain neuropils. The highest density of binding sites for [3H]serotonin and [3H]octopamine was found in the mushroom bodies. In some brain areas, especially the mushroom bodies, mismatches exist between binding sites and immunoreactivities, suggesting that the two amines also bind to neuropils which are not directly innervated by 5HT-like or OA-like immunoreactive neurons. The action of the two amines on behaviour in the bee is antagonistic. In the antennal pathway, proboscis and antennal responses to olfactory and gustatory stimuli are enhanced by OA and reduced by 5HT. In olfactory conditioning experiments, storage and retrieval of the learned signal can be enhanced by OA and reduced by 5HT. The specificity of these effects depends on the site of amine application in the neuropil. In the visual system the direction specificity of the visual antennal response is enhanced by OA and reduced by 5HT after topical application or injection into the lobula, the third optic ganglion. Correlates for the behavioural modulation can be found in higher-order visual interneurons. While OA application can mimic the stimulation of the bee with sugar water, the behavioural conditions leading to the release of 5HT are not yet known. © 1993 Birkhäuser Verlag Basel.","behaviour; honey bee; Insect; neuromodulation; octopamine; serotonin",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027772230

This paper examines how the individuals in the honey bee colony, a society exhibiting an extreme degree of co-operation, are, nonetheless, in conflict during certain of the colony's activities at the point of greatest conflict in honey bee social life: the division of the colony between queens during colony fission or swarming. Here, the decisions are made regarding which queens leave with swarms and how many swarms (queens) are produced. These choices are ultimately shaped by ecological consequences in terms of survival of the swarms produced. This analysis suggests an explanation of the initially counter-intuitive forfeit of the established nest by the mother queen, and a context for understanding the variation in worker behavior toward virgin queens. It also suggests that the 'afterswarming syndrome' of behaviors, including piping behavior of queen bees, reflects the result of manipulation of virgin queens' interests by worker bees resulting in a resolution of conflict through a forced alignment of interests. © 1993 Academic Press Limited.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027329437

Although all colonies of lineage C exhibit the same pattern (C1), each one of lineages A and M presents up to 10 different haplotypes, opening the way to studies on the genetic structure and the evolution of a large fraction of the species.

These components were tested individually or in a synthetic mixture for their ability to elicit the conditioned proboscis extension response. Three experiments were done: conditioning to the mixture at one concentration (1.0, 0.1 or 0.01 μg per component) and testing to the individual components either at the conditioning or at the other concentrations; conditioning to individual components and testing to the mixture (1.0 μg); conditioning and testing to the individual components (1.0 μg). The results from the proboscis extension assay were then compared to those obtained from free-flying bees in a flight room. From the conditioned proboscis extension assay, a conditioning threshold level was found (0.1 μg for the mixture studied) below which a reliable conditioning could not be achieved. Recognition thresholds were observed: bees responded to concentrations ten-fold higher or lower than that used for conditioning. Responses to lower concentrations were weaker, whilst responses were increased at concentrations higher than the conditioning one. A hierarchy within the compounds tested was found, with linalool, 2-phenylethanol and methyl salicylate cueing mixture recognition more effectively than the other components. The ranking order of the six components was similar in both the conditioned proboscis extension and the conditioned foraging behaviour in flight room. When conditioned and tested to the individual components, bees discriminated a learned odour from a number of others. However, the specificity level for the recognition of the learned odour varied according to the component, the most clearly discriminated being the compounds which were used by the bee in mixture recognition. © 1993 IRL Press at Oxford University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027515093

The biological significance of this behavior was unclear until Seeley (1992) demonstrated that tremble dances occur mainly when a colony's nectar influx is so high that the foragers must undertake lenghty searches in order to find food storers to unload their nectar. He suggested that tremble dancing has the effect of stimulating additional bees to function as food-storers, thereby raising the colony's capacity for processing nectar. Here I describe vibrational signals emitted by the tremble dancers. Simulation experiments with artificial tremble dance sounds revealed that these sounds inhibited dancing and reduced recruitment to feeding sites. The results suggest that the tremble dance is a negative feedback system counterbalancing the positive feedback of recruitment by waggle dances. Thus, the tremble dance seems to affect not only the colony's nectar processing rate, but also its nectar intake rate. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Communication; Dance language; Sound",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027796592

Hypotheses to explain this phenomenon have assumed that the workers that constitute the entourage for the new queen (or queens) represent investment in female reproductives. Selection for optimal colony sex allocation then leads to an increase in production of males that balances the investment in females based on their relative reproductive values. We show that the construction of comb dedicated to the production of males (drone comb) versus workers (worker comb) is a component of sex investment under the control of colony workers. Relative comb construction was highly correlated with the relative investment in male and worker brood. Colonies that invested relatively more in their total numbers of males invested less in the dry weight of individual workers. Colonies that had more adult workers produced a greater number of males and workers, but colony size did not affect the proportional investment in drone comb or brood. Genetic variability was found for the number of adult workers in colonies, the amount of drone comb produced, the amount of worker comb produced, and the dry weight of adult workers, suggesting that sex allocation is a selectable trait in honeybees. © 1993 International Society for Behavioral Ecology.","Colony fission; Sex allocation; Sex ratio; Social insects",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027878929

The different tropical propolis generally showed a single phenolic profile characterized by the occurrence of polyprenylated benzophenones as major components. Flavonoids were present in only a few samples, and in each case they were found to be lipophilic methylated 6-oxygenated flavones (eupatorin, hispidulin, 5-hydroxy-6,7,3′,4′-tetramethoxyflavone, etc.). Generally, no correlations between the composition of tropical propolis and the place of collection or the bee species were found. However, propolis from temperate areas contained flavonoids (with an unsubstituted ring B) as the main phenolic components (pinobanksin, pinobanksin 3-acetate, pinocembrin, chrysin, galangin and tectochrysin). These analyses confirmed that the source of the phenolics found in propolis produced in temperate regions was different Populus species of section Aigeiros (Salicaceae). The resins exuded by the flowers of Clusia minor and C. major (Guttiferae) contained the polyprenylated benzophenones found in the majority of the propolis studied, suggesting that this is the main source for propolis in tropical Venezuela. © 1993.","botanical origin; chemosystematics.; Clusia minor, C. major; flavonoids; Guttiferae; HPLC; phenolic compounds; polyprenylated benzophenones; Populus nigra; propolis; Salicaceae",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000071225

Towne (1985) reported that in the Asian honeybee species Apis dorsata, which builds a single comb in the open under overhanging rocks or tree branches, sound signals were not emitted by the dancers. This led to the conclusion that acoustical communication is restricted to bees that nest in the dark, like A. mellifera. Here we show that in fact A. dorsata produces dance sounds similar to those emitted by A. mellifera, and that these acoustical signals contain information about distance, direction and profitability of food sources. The acoustical transfer of information has thus evolved independently of nesting in dark cavities. The significance of nocturnal activity in Apis dorsata for the evolution of sound communication is discussed. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.","Apsis dorsata; Asian honey bees; Communication; Sound",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027797117

The brightness of the sky against which drones performed this task was measured as the radiance over a range of wavelengths covering the absorbance spectra of the principal drone rhodopsin and its metarhodopsin. This brightness varied relatively little, by just over one log unit. In laboratory experiments on the intact drone, the amplitude of photoreceptor responses to small decrements in intensity showed a marked maximum when the background intensity depolarized the cells to about -35mV. The radiance of this optimal background was only 0.2 log units greater than the sky radiance at which most drones were seen. It is argued that because of probable systematic errors the true difference may be less. It is known that in superfused retinal slices voltage-dependent sodium channels amplify small signals under these stimulus conditions. We therefore conclude that this amplification is useful for the major visual activity of the drone. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Honeybee drone; Photoreceptors; Sodium channels; Vision",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000858338

The sensilla were stimulated with one of two sets of four compounds and their binary mixtures, at two dosage levels. Aromatic compounds comprised one set, and saturated n-octane derivatives comprised the other set. Correlation, principal component, and cluster analyses indicate that responses to binary mixtures are not linear combinations of responses to the component compounds. The first principal component indicated that neuronal units had either more excitatory or more inhibitory responses to all odorants than would be expected from a model where inhibitory and excitatory responses are randomly distributed among the neuronal units. When compared to the responses to the component odorants, synergistic responses to binary odors occurred more often than would be expected by chance. Clear inhibitory responses to binary odors were less prevalent. This study agrees with an earlier study employing aromatic odorants in that most of the aromatic odorants each had groups of receptor neurons that were relatively selective for it, and each odorant had a distinctly different number of receptor neurons selective for it. Among the octane derivatives, receptor neurons were selective for the level of oxidation of the functional group or its site of attachment, rather than specific compounds. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.","Concentration; Honeybee; Inhibition; Olfaction; Synergism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000154533

On the basis of playback experiments and behavioral analysis, this study presents the following evidence for a different signal function. Stop signals (1) can be produced by tremble dancers, dance followers, and waggle dancers; (2) rarely elicit trophallaxis; and (3) evidently cause waggle dancers to leave the dance floor. Subsequent work by Kirchner (submitted) using vibrational playback experiments confirms the latter observation. When the colony's food storers are temporarily overwhelmed by a large nectar influx, returning foragers will search for prolonged periods before unloading food and consequently begin to tremble dance (Seeley 1992). In this study, tremble dancers were the major producer of stop signals on the dance floor. The stop signal may thus retard recruitment until balance is restored. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027801528

Foraging and pollination efficiencies of the two bee species were studied comparatively. During the experimental period (10 days), the stingless bee foraged well and the nest weight did not change, though the honey bee often foraged inefficiently and the nest weight decreased by 2 kg. The average nectar volume of a flower was lower in the honey bee area (0.02 μl) and nearly the same in the other two areas (0.1 μl). We make a numerical model to describe pollination and fertilization process. This model shows that one visit of the honey bee pollinated 11% of achenes and one visit of the stingless bee did 4.7% on average and that 11 visits of the honey bee or 30 visits of the stingless bee are required per flower to attain normal berry (fertilization rate, 87%). In this study, the rate of deformed berries in the stingless bee area (73%) was lower than that of the control area (90%), but higher than that of the honey bee area (51%).

The distribution of the Na,K-ATPase (sodium pump) over these domains was examined in the honeybee photoreceptor using a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the sodium pump α-subunit (∼100 kDa). We find that the sodium pump is restricted to sites of the nonreceptive photoreceptor surface closely juxtaposed to glial cells; no sodium pumps were detected on the glia-free domains of the nonreceptive surface and on the light-sensitive microvillar membranes. In order to determine the role of photoreceptor-glia contact in maintaining this polarized pump distribution, we assayed the distribution of the Na,K-ATPase after experimentally influencing photoreceptor-glia contact. Sodium pumps were present on the entire nonreceptive photoreceptor surface when photoreceptor-glia contact was removed by isolating the photoreceptors. Remodeling photoreceptor-glia contact by incubation in hyperosmotic saline caused a redistribution of sodium pumps on the photoreceptor surface corresponding to the redistribution of glial cells. We show, further, that both photoreceptor-glia contact and Na,K-ATPase distribution are independent of extracellular Ca2+. No junctional structures were observed at the borders between Na,K-ATPase-positive and Na,K-ATPase-negative membrane domains. Together, these results suggest that adhesion of glial cells to the photoreceptors plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the polarized distribution of Na,K-ATPase in the honeybee photoreceptors. The Ca2+-independent adhesion of glial cells to the photoreceptor surface may trap the pump molecules at the sites of photoreceptor-glia contact.","Cell adhesion molecule; Cell polarity; Na,K-ATPase; Neuron-glia interaction; Photoreceptor; Retina",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027312755

The open reading frame of Dth-1 is interrupted by two large introns of 8 kb and 12 kb Dth-2 also shows two introns, but these are short (42 bp and 44 bp) and the second interrupts helix III at position 44-45, as is the case with other homeobox genes from such divergent animals as Drosophila, honeybee, C. elegans, ascidians, and mouse, which suggests an ancient evolutionary relationship between these genes. The spatial distribution of transcripts in adult tissues, determined by in situ hybridization, demonstrates that Dth-1 is expressed at a high level in the gastrodermal cells, while Dth-2 is expressed in the peripheral parenchyma, at higher levels in the dorsal than the ventral regions. Their specific spatial distribution suggests a possible role for these homeobox genes in determination and/or differentiation of specific cell types. The expression pattern of both genes is more or less continuous, but in Dth-1 clustered discontinuous labelling in areas surrounding the gastrodermis may indicate a specific expression of this gene in groups of undifferentiated cells (neoblasts) already committed or determined to gastrodermal cell fates. In situ hybridization analysis during early regeneration shows expression only in the postblastema (stump) differentiated areas while no expression has been detected in the undifferentiated blastema, indicating that neither gene has a role in pattern formation mechanisms known to occur at the early stages of regeneration (0-3 days). Hence, Dth-1 and Dth-2 are planarian homeobox genes presumably involved in specific cell or tissue determination and/or differentiation.","Gene expression; Homeobox; In situ hybridization; Planarian",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027217347

We have dissected this humoral ""immune"" system into its constituent components. In addition to the previously characterized apidaecins and abaecin, we also isolated a member of the defensin family of peptide antibiotics and, now, a novel 93-amino acid long, cationic polypeptide, termed hymenoptaecin.

Like an organism, it functions as a coherent unit, carefully regulating its internal milieu. But the colony consists of thousands of loosely assembled individuals each functioning rather autonomously. How, then, does the colony acquire the necessary information to organize its work force? And how do individuals acquire information about specific colony needs, and thus know what tasks need be performed? I address these questions through experiments that analyze how honey bees acquire information about the colony's need for pollen and how they regulate its collection. The results demonstrate features of the colony's system for regulating pollen foraging: (1) Pollen foragers quickly acquire new information about the colony's need for pollen. (2) When colony pollen stores are supplemented, many pollen foragers respond by switching to nectar foraging or by remaining in the hive and ceasing to forage at all. (3) Pollen foragers do not need direct contact with pollen to sense the colony's change of state, nor do they use the odor of pollen as a cue to assess the colony's need for pollen. (4) Pollen foragers appear to obtain their information about colony pollen need indirectly from other bees in the hive. (5) The information takes the form of an inhibitory cue. The proposed mechanism for the regulation of pollen foraging involves a hierarchical system of information acquisition and a negative feedback loop. By taking advantage of the vast processing capacity of large numbers of individuals working in parallel, such a system of information acquisition and dissemination may be ideally suited to promote efficient regulation of labor within the colony. Although each individual relies on only limited, local information, the colony as a whole achieves a finely-tuned response to the changing conditions it experiences. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027870098

Radiolabel was rapidly transported from the center to the peripheral regions of the nest, and in a manner consistent with worker to worker transport. Population size and congestion had no effect on the relative rates of movement from the center to the periphery of the nest or on the mean amounts of radiolabel on individual bees. However, a significantly smaller proportion of the workers in the populous colonies received detectable amounts of radiolabel than in the uncongested colonies, and workers carrying especially large amounts of radiolabel were less numerous in the crowded colonies. It is suggested that, at the stage of colony development that the colonies were in, population size has more of an effect on intranest pheromone transmission than does crowding. Interference with pheromone transfer may occur only at higher levels of congestion than were created, and nearer to the reproductive phase of colony development.

For this reason we have studied the early differentiation of the honeybee ovariole histologically, ultrastructurally, and by staining F-actin with rhodaminyl-phalloidin. At the anterior tip of the ovariole, stem cells are lined up in a single file; they are organelle-poor but contain characteristic electrondense bodies with lysosomal properties. The presence of these bodies in cystocytes as well as prefollicle cells indicates that both cell types may be derived from the apical stem cells. During later stages of oogenesis, the follicle cells differentiate cytologically in different regions of the follicle. The organization of the intercellular bridges between cystocytes derived from a single cystoblast has been studied in detail. The polyfusomes in the intercellular bridges of cystocyte clusters stain with rhodaminyl-phalloidin and hence contain F-actin. Later, when the polyfusomes begin to desintegrate, F-actin rings form which line the rims of the intercellular bridges. Actin might be recruited from conspicuous F-actin stores which were detected in the germ-line cells. The F-actin rings are dissembled some time before the onset of vitellogenesis when the nurse chamber has grown to a length of about 200 μm. At the basal side of the follicle cells (close to the basement membrane facing the haemocdele) parallel microfilament bundles encircle the ovariole. The microfilament bundles which are oriented mostly perpendicular to the long axis of the ovariole were first observed around the zone where the cystocyte divisions occur; after this phase the micro-filament bundles become organized differently in the follicle cells associated with the nurse cells and in the follicular epithelium of the oocyte. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Fusomes; Germ-line cells; Microfilaments; Oogenesis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027401543

These results have been reported for Drosophila, monarch butterflies, honeybees, blue mussels, side-blotched lizards, killifish, salmonid fishes, guppies, Sonoran topminnows, herring, rufous-collared sparrows, house sparrows, brown hares, white-tailed deer, and humans. Because heterozygosity at a few loci can not predict heterozygosity of the entiry genome, these loci must be detecting localized zones that influence the developmental environment. Studies of malate dehydrogenase in honeybees, Apis mellifera, and lactate dehydrogenase in killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, revealed that developmental homeostasis varied with heterozygosity of individual loci. Heterozygotes differed from homozygotes in fluctuating asymmetry, morphological variance, and in correlations between morphological characters. The protein loci in these studies code for enzymes, and therefore do not directly influence morphological characters. However, some enzymatic loci substantially influence metabolism, and contribute to variation in the amount of energy available for development and growth. This argument can be made most convincingly for the LDH polymorphism in killifish. LDH genotypes differ in enzyme kinetic properties that measure differences in physiological efficiency, and these differences produce measurable and predictable differences in physiology and development. Under environmental conditions which impose a stress upon development, genotypes at these loci may have different amounts of energy available for development, and consequently exhibit different levels of developmental homeostasis. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","developmental homeostasis; enzyme heterozygosity; physiological efficiency; routine metabolic cost",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027130214

Honey bees foraging for nectar on lavender (Lavandula stoechas) chose inflorescences with more of their flowers open. The number of open flowers predicted whether an inflorescence was visited by bees, inspected but rejected, or ignored. Inflorescences chosen arbitrarily by observers had numbers of open flowers intermediate between those of visited and ignored inflorescences. Differences in morphological characters between types of inflorescence correlated with nectar volume and sugar weight per flower so that visited inflorescences had a disproportionately greater volume of nectar and weight of sugar per flower and greater variance in nectar volume. Although there were significant associations between nectar content and the morphological characters of inflorescences, discriminant function analysis revealed discrimination on the basis of morphology rather than nectar content. Visited inflorescences tended to have smaller than average flowers but bees tended to probe the largest flowers on visited inflorescences. Choice of flowers within inflorescences is explicable in terms of the relationship between flower size and nectar content. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

The ultrastructure of ejaculated sperm of the honey bee, Apis mellifera L., was studied after sperm were processed by using a high‐pressure freezing fixation and freezing substitution method. The electron micrographs of samples processed by this method clearly revealed previously unobserved or unresolved fine details, particularly those in the acrosomal complex. The present study demonstrates that the acrosomal complex of honey bee sperm consists of an anterior tubular acicular apex, an enlarged spherical region, and the elongated acrosomal proper. Internally, the structures of acrosomal complex confirm the general description of the tri‐layer model; having an extra‐acrosomal layer, an acrosome vesicle, and a central acrosomal rod located in a subacrosomal cavity. The acrosomal rod terminates anteriorly with an electron dense corpuscle in an ensheathing cap at the spherical region. The electron micrographs also show the presence of a centriolar adjunct and a structure possibly of a centriolar or basal body origin.

Examination of the morphology of avocado flowers showed that the pistillate and stami-nate flower stages have similar structures. Bees collecting nectar, or nectar and pollen, visited both pistillate and staminate flowers, and due to the flower structure they were forced to touch both pistil and anthers. Only limited sites on a bee’s body contacted the anthers, and these ‘collection sites’ also contacted the stigma, which occupied the same position as the anthers of the inner stamens. Most avocado pollen grains on bees visiting staminate flowers were clumped at the ‘collection sites’ and constituted the main pollen available for pollination. Some pollen grains randomly distributed over the entire bodies of bees visiting either pistillate or staminate flowers could have been acquired inside the hive, and did not play an important role in pollination. The observations suggest that pollination within a cultivar is accomplished during the overlapping phase of its pistillate and staminate flowering, during which bees collecting nectar and pollen move freely among neighbouring staminate and pistillate flowers. Pollination between cultivars of opposite flowering type is carried out by bees moving between them throughout the overlapping period of pistillate flowering of one cultivar and staminate flowering of the other. Bees which collect only pollen usually do not visit pistillate flowers and do not contribute to pollination. © 1993 International Bee Research Association.","Apis mellifera; Avocado; Cross pollination; Flowering; Foraging; Honey bees; In-hive pollen transfer; Persea americana; Pollen; Pollination",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027132804

The effect of semen storage time, drone age and semen contamination on honey bee semen quality was investigated using assays for motility and viability of semen in vitro. Four age groups (1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks) and five storage times (0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks) were examined. As storage time increased, sperm viability and motility significantly decreased. However, motility patterns of unstored semen samples were significantly lower than those samples that were stored up to 2 weeks. Sperm viability decreased significantly with increasing drone age, but motility patterns did not change. Those semen samples that were found to be contaminated with foreign particles or microorganisms had a significantly lower mean viability than uncontaminated samples.

Exocrine gland secretions from the Nasanov glands of workers and the tarsal glands of both female castes and drones also contained soluble proteins. Proteins of tarsal gland secretions may contribute to the milieu of surface proteins because the electrophoretic profiles of cuticular proteins and tarsal secretions were similar. In contrast, the electrophoretic profile of proteins from Nasanov gland secretions was distinct from the profile of the tarsal gland secretion.

The nectary appears as swellings on the basal part of the ovary. The nectariferous cells are smaller and denser than the neighbouring parenchyma. Stomata are present in the nectary epidermis, but do not appear on the other parts of the ovary epidermis. Seven pepper breeding lines were grown near a bee yard in Rehovot. Five to six fold differences in nectar volume were found between the extreme genotypes. Nectar volumes were higher during noon and afternoon hours, as compared with morning hours. High correlation coefficients between nectar volume and sugar concentration were found. These were significant for the four high nectar yielding genotypes, ranging between r = 0.65 to r = 0.94. Male‐fertile flowers produced more nectar and higher sugar concentration than sterile ones. Skewed distribution was observed in nectar volume of F2 populations, but relatively low heritability values were calculated. Pepper nectar contains fructose and glucose only. The former occupies 52–82 % of the total sugar content. Pepper genotypes varied in frequency of honeybee visits and significant correlation between sugar quantity and number of honeybee visits per flower was evident. Fertile pepper flowers are not very attractive to honeybees and male‐sterile flowers are even less so. The considerable variation in nectar characteristics can be exploited to increase attractiveness to honeybees, thus facilitating bee pollination in commercial production of F1hybrid seeds and improve fruit quality.

Sucrose was never detected. Brief exposure to carbon dioxide or confinement to glass vials did not effect the blood sugar titers. Outgoing forager bees had sufficient tissue reserves and crop stores to maintain constant blood sugar titers for 15-60 min, the length of time depending on the initial amount of honey in the crop. Typically, blood glucose and trehalose concentrations declined over 50% after 30 min without food. Normal glucose and trehalose titers were restored within 10 min after bees started to feed again, indicating a very rapid sugar mobilization from the gut into the blood. The pyroglutamate aminopeptidase digestion of a specific compound isolated from the corpus cardiacum of honeybees suggests that it is a peptide belonging to the adipokinetic hormone/red-pigment concentrating hormone family. Extracts of the corpus cardiacum of honeybees elevated blood sugars when injected into Periplaneta and lipids when injected into Acheta but there was no response when injected into the honeybee. Octopamine treatment also had no effect on either glucose or trehalose titers in the honeybee.

The consensus sequence is 176 nucleotides long and has an A + T content of 58%. There are clusters of both direct and inverted repeats. Internal subrepeating units ranging from 11 to 17 nucleotides are observed, suggesting that it could have evolved from a shorter sequence. DNA sequence data reveal that this repeat class is unusually homogeneous compared to the other class of invertebrate highly reiterated DNA sequences. The average pairwise sequence divergence between the repeats is 2.5%.

Various EBI fungicides were combined separately with the pyrethroid lambda‐cyhalothrin at ratios derived from their recommended application rates to represent tank‐mixing in the field. The mixture was then applied topically to the thorax of honeybees, and mortality assessed 24 h post‐treatment. All the fungicides tested increased the toxicity of lambda‐cyhalothrin to honeybees. The fungicide propiconazole was found to have the strongest synergistic effect, decreasing the LD50 of lambda‐cyalothrin from 68.0 ng bee−1 to 4.2 ng, thus having a synergistic ratio of 16.2. Hazard ratios were calculated for lambda‐cyhalothrin and fungicide mixtures using a recommended application rate of 7.5 g a.i. ha−1. The hazard ratio for lambda‐cyhalothrin alone was 110, but when mixed with fungicide synergists, the hazard ratio ranged from 366 with flutriafol to 1786 with propiconazole. A blank formulation of a fungicide (without the active ingredient prochloraz) had little effect on the toxicity of lambda‐cyhalothrin, indicating that it is primarily the fungicide active ingredient that is responsible for the synergistic effect.

Relative to their positions in the Drosophila map, 11 of the tRNA genes are in altered positions, but the other genes and regions are in the same relative positions. Comparisons of the predicted protein sequences indicate that the honeybee mitochondrial genetic code is the same as that for Drosophila; but the anticodons of two tRNAs differ between these two insects. The base composition shows extreme bias, being 84.9% AT (cf. 78.6% in Drosophila yakuba). In protein-encoding genes, the AT bias is strongest at the third codon positions (which in some cases lack guanines altogether), and least in second codon positions. Multiple stepwise regression analysis of the predicted products of the protein-encoding genes shows a significant association between the numbers of occurrences of amino acids and %T in codon family, but not with the number of codons per codon family or other parameters associated with codon family base composition. Differences in amino acid abundances are apparent between the predicted Apis and Drosophila proteins, with a relative abundance in the Apis proteins of lysine and a relative deficiency of alanine. Drosophila alanine residues are as often replaced by serine as conserved in Apis. The differences in abundances between Drosophila and Apis are associated with %AT in the codon families, and the degree of divergence in amino acid composition between proteins correlates with the divergence in %AT at the second codon positions. Overall, transversions are about twice as abundant as transitions when comparing Drosophila and Apis protein-encoding genes, but this ratio varies between codon positions. Marked excesses of transitions over chance expectation are seen for the third positions of protein-coding genes and for the gene for the small subunit of ribosomal RNA. For the third codon positions the excess of transitions is adequately explained as due to the restriction of observable substitutions to transitions for conserved amino acids with two-codon families; the excess of transitions over expectation for the small ribosomal subunit suggests that the conservation of nucleotide size is favored by selection.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027398565

Donor bees that attained the same final crop load but spent more or less time drinking at the feeder, because of differences in the flow rate, decreased the transfer delay when the flow rate of feeding increased.

African bees achieve higher rates of reproduction and colony growth partly by collecting more pollen relative to nectar1 and by allocating more nutrients to brood rearing 2. African colonies generate more swarms3,4 which travel far greater distances5. These adaptive traits have been dramatically manifested in the neotropics: African bees have formed large expanding feral populations, whereas few European bees have survived outside apiaries 6. The feral populations consist of African matrilines7-9 that have not hybridized extensively with European drones from apiaries 10. Perhaps because of their European heritage, hybrids are poorly adapted to the tropics and thus do not survive. European matrilines, however, do not become part of the feral population, even after repeated backcrossing with feral African drones7-10. Conceivably, negative heterosis could further reduce hybrid survival, where European maternal factors are particularly detrimental7. We report here physiological findings consistent with these possibilities. Mass-specific metabolic capacities were higher in African bees than in European bees and were low and nonintermediate in hybrids. Thus, higher metabolic and flight capacities may contribute to African bees' competitive advantages in the tropics. © 1993 Nature Publishing Group.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027336230

The circadian locomotor (walking) rhythms of forager honeybees (Apis mellifera ligustica L.) were entrained to eight different 24 h light‐dark cycles. The phases of activity onset, peak activity, and offset were correlated with the lights‐off transition, suggesting lights‐off as the primary zeitgeber for the rhythm. Further support for this hypothesis was provided by LD 1:23 experiments, in which entrainment occurred when the light pulse was situated at the end, but not at the beginning, of the subjective photophase. Steady‐state entrainment of the locomotor rhythm was achieved with square‐wave temperature cycles of 10oC amplitude under constant dark: most of the activity occurred within the early thermophase. Smaller amplitude temperature cycles yielded relative coordination of the rhythm. Interactions of temperature and light‐dark cycles resulted in entrainment patterns different from those elicited in response to either cycle alone or those formed by a simple combination of the two separate responses. Furthermore, temperature cycles having amplitudes insufficient for entrainment of the rhythm nevertheless modified the pattern of entrainment to light ‐ dark cycles, suggesting a synergism of light and temperature effects on the underlying circadian clock system.

The floret inspection by honeybees Apis mellifera ligustica on inflorescences of Carduus acanthoides was studied in a natural patch. First‐day stage capitula were protected with a net hood against insect visits. The next day, the net hood was removed at the time of maximal nectar accumulation, allowing a bee to visit the inflorescence. Walking trajectories on the capitula, the number of florets inspected and the duration of the visit were recorded. After the bee's departure, the inflorescence was cut off and analysed in the laboratory to determine the presence or absence of nectar in each of its florets. 2. Bees made inspection trajectories without a defined systematic pattern. 3. The number of floret inspections performed represented a high percentage of the available florets (57.37 ± 2.81%; mean ± SE; n = 8). 4.

Thermal constraints on flight acivity limit the pollinating effectiveness of bees. Each species of social bee has a microclimatic ‘window’ within which foraging flight can be sustained. To predict whether a given species of social bee is worth testing as a pollinator in a given climate, it is useful to know at least the lower limits of that microclimatic ‘window’. We consider how information from a series of bee counts through a day can be used to characterize a bee species in terms of activity/microclimate relations as a basis for predicting the diel pattern of foraging activity of a bee introduced into a new climate as a pollinator. We discuss the relative merits of bee counts at a foraging patch and counts based on hive traffic as indices of the proportion of bees active. We suggest that the activity/microclimate relations of a species be expressed in terms of the lower threshold black globe temperature for flight activity. Black globe temperature, Tg, is easily measured with inexpensive equipment, and can substitute for measurements of ambient temperature and radiation as a predictor of diel patterns of bee activity. We use examples of field data to explore the relationship between microclimate and activity for the honeybee Apis mellifera and several species of bumblebee, Bombus. Regression analysis is used to relate activity to Tg and to identify the lower temperature threshold for activity from field bee counts. In field studies analysed here, the bumblebees Bombus terrestrisllucorum, B.pascuorum and B.hortorum began foraging at lower temperatures than honey‐bees or B.lapidarius.

Colonies were headed by instrumentally inseminated queens selected on the basis of uncapping and removal behaviour expressed by their progeny. In the first experiment, colony strength was altered by transferring hygienic and non-hygienic colonies from 10-frame field hives to 2-frame observation hives. This treatment significantly reduced the hygienic response of the hygienic bees but did not affect the response of the non-hygienic bees. In the second experiment, hygienic and non-hygienic bees displayed different responses to freeze-killed and live brood which had been partially or entirely uncapped. Both lines of bees recapped both partially and entirely uncapped live brood, but non-hygienic bees also recapped partially uncapped freeze-killed brood, suggesting that non-hygienic bees either could not detect dead or diseased brood or avoided it by sealing it within a comb cell. The third experiment tested whether the degree of hygienic behaviour could be increased by adding hygienic bees to non-hygienic colonies. Adding 20–30% young hygienic bees to non-hygienic colonies did not increase the degree of hygienic behaviour, but adding young non-hygienic bees to hygienic colonies suppressed the behaviour. The results suggest that although hygienic behavior is genetically determined, its expression depends on colony strength and composition of workers within the colony. In the fourth experiment, the hygienic and non-hygienic colonies were fed with pollen patties containing A. apis spores. The weak correspondence that was observed between removal behaviour and physiological resistance to chalkbrood suggested that few colonies are both highly hygienic and physiologically resistant to chalkbrood. Selection against uncapping and removing diseased brood might occur if this behaviour also promotes the spread of disease through the colony. This possibility is discussed in relation to avoidance behaviour of other social insects toward pathogens. © 1993 International Bee Research Association.","Apis mellifera; Ascosphaera apis; Brood removal; Chalkbrood; Disease resistance; Genetic factors; Honey bees; Hygienic behaviour",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027143343

Latent learning plays an important role in spatial orientation and learning during dance communication. In associative learning, stimuli experienced immediately before the reward (usually sucrose solution) are memorized for the guidance of future behaviour. The classical conditioning of olfactory stimulii is a very effective form of learning in bees and has helped to describe the behavioural and physiological basis of memory formation. Memory needs time to be established and is processed in sequential phases. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027798994

Individual honeybees have a biased direction of movement and alter their movement patterns in response to plant spacing. Biased movement results in an increase in the expected pollen dispersal distance, and predicted dispersal distance increased with increasing interplant distance.

A forager's perception of resource profitability may be affected by her past foraging experience. To test this, the concentrations of sucrose solutions in feeders were varied and dance characteristics that serve as indicators of resource profitability were recorded. Round dances of foragers that had last visited a lesser concentration than that on which they were presently foraging had higher rates of directional reversal, circuit rates and speeds than those of foragers on the same concentration that had last visited a feeder offering a higher sucrose concentration. Dance information related to resource profitability was thus modulated by the immediate past experience of a forager, and was not based strictly on absolute resource profitability. Losses were weighted more heavily than gains.

The white, entomophilous flowers are adichogamous and last 5-14 days, but pollen transfer takes place only on days 1-3. A mild, vanillin-like odour along with nectar and pollen attracts >20 insect species, of which five are probable pollinators. These are mainly Diptera, but also include the domestic honeybee Apis mellifera. Reproduction in C. paradoxa is exclusively sexual and xenogamous, with pollen transfer depending solely on insect vectors. Although flower morphology and phenology do not prevent self-pollination, and geitonogamy can easily take place, autogamy was not detected. Hence, some self-incompatibility mechanism is operative. Only 25% of the flowers initiated fruits, and just 6.1% from the flowers fully developed capsules. Fruit initiation was apparently pollen-limited at the flower level. Higher rates of fruit initiation and fruit ripening occurred late in the flowering period. The seed/ovule ratio in fruits bearing viable seeds was 42.7%. Predispersal (maternal) reproductive success (percent ovules becoming viable seeds) was 2.6%.

Experiments with artificial swarms demonstrated similar reorientation by bees and further showed that the experience of being in a swarm triggers patterns of behaviour apparently used in reorientation. In addition, bees remembered information about the natal nest even after they moved to a new nest: Reoriented bees from artificial swarms deprived of their new hive returned to their natal hive rather than to another equidistantly located hive. These results demonstrate a high degree of plasticity in honey bee spatial memory; experienced foragers returning to their new nest apparently can adopt new responses to landmarks that were previously used to guide them to their natal nest, while still retaining the ability to locate their natal nest. © 1993 Academic Press, Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027878653

By using degenerate oligonucleotides derived from the amino-terminal sequence of this hyaluronidase reported by others, clones encoding the precursor for this enzyme could be isolated from a cDNA library prepared from venom glands of worker bees. The deduced amino acid sequence showed that bee venom hyaluronidase is a polypeptide composed of 349 amino acids containing four cysteines and three potential sites for N-glycosylation. The sequence of the precursor also indicated that the conversion of the pro-enzyme to the end product must involve cleavage of a Thr-Pro bond, a most unusual processing reaction. The mRNA encoding hyaluronidase could also be detected in testes from drones. Expression of the cloned cDNA in Escherichia coli yielded a 41- kDa polypeptide that had hyaluronidase activity.

Roughly half the honey mesquites produce no nectar. There were no significant difference between morphs in pod production per raceme and compatibilities. Fruit set is significantly higher in open, cross-pollinated inflorescences. There is a high abortion rate in both naturally and hand-pollinated inforescences, regardless of nectar presence. The total daily numbers of the more abundant insect pollinators, Apis mellifera and Melissodes tristis, were the same when trees with and without nectar were aggregated, but were much higher in nectar producers when trees were in isolation. The number of pollinator species was also higher in nectar-producing trees, but although the number of pods per raceme was apparently higher in isolated, nectar-producing trees, differences between morphs were not significant. This result could be due to high costs of nectar in the plants that produce it, resource limitation, and/or because flowers need only one or few pollinator visits to set fruit. Nectar dimorphism in the honey mequite is suggested to be a case of automimicry. -Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027800478

However, testing the toxicity of these substances is difficult in vivo. In the present study we compared the toxicity of PLA2s from three snake venoms, bee venom and human pancreas on MCF-7 cells grown in culture. Tetrazolium microculture assays were developed to test the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of PLA2 on MCF-7 cells. These tests are based on the ability of viable cells to reduce a tetrazolium-based compound MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] to a blue formazan product. Leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LD) from the cells into the culture medium was also measured. There were marked differences in the toxicity of the PLA2s tested. Cobra (Naja mosambique mosambique) venom PLA2 was toxic to the cells at a concentration of 4.5 U/ml. Light microscopic changes were seen in the injured cells after 3 hr treatment. Sixty-seven per cent of cells were dead after 24hr treatment. Treatment for 4 hr caused irreversible changes in the cells. Leakage of LD was noted from 4 hr onwards. Other snake (Crotalus adamanteus and Laticauda semifasciata) venom PLA2s, even after continuous exposure to 4.5 U/ml caused only slight decreases in values obtained in the MTT test. No morphologic changes suggesting a cytotoxic effect were seen. PLA2 from bee (Apis mellifera) venom had no toxic effect, either. Continuous exposure of cells to human pancreatic PLA2 caused a 15% decrease in the MTT-test.

Each hive received a uniform colony of 5 048 ± 125 (mean ± s.d.) honey bees (Apis mellifera) that had been established from a single, artificially mixed population; 38% of the bees were infested with tracheal mites (Acarapis woodi). During June and July, bees produced more brood and honey in white hives than in dark hives. On 5 August, dark hives contained fewer tracheal mites than white hives; mites were found in 1 dark and 10 white hives (P < 0.001). In summer, the temperature in the space between brood combs in the dark hives often exceeded 40°C; maximum temperatures in the brood areas of dark and white hives, were 45°C and 38°C respectively. Laboratory tests showed that heat can kill tracheal mites inside live bees. A single six-hour exposure of bees to 42°C, a condition comparable to the short periods of high temperature encountered in field colonies, significantly reduced mite populations. In a second test, three-day-old worker bees were kept at 34.5°C or 39°C for 48 h and evaluated four days later (both groups of bees were stored at 34.5°C during the last four days). Bees kept at 34.5°C (controls) contained 2.7 larval mites per adult mite; bees exposed to 39°C contained 0.01. Controls contained nearly twice as many eggs (2.8 vs. 1.5 eggs per adult mite). This suggests that existing eggs died or did not develop during the 48 h at 39°C and that viable eggs were not produced during that period. © 1993 International Bee Research Association.","Acarapis woodi; Apis mellifera; Heat; Hive colour; Hive temperature; Honey bees; Mortality; Tracheal mites",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027134314

The major treatments included: (I) a single queen wintered in a small nucleus colony (control); and colony banks with 24 or 48 queens, each held individually in (II) screen cages that prevented workers from entering the cage, but allowed access for queen tending, (III) queen-excluder cages (queen-excluder material has openings of about 55 mm that prevent the larger queen but not the smaller workers from passing through the material), or (IV) screen cages until January and subsequent transfer to mini-nuclei until late March. Queens held in excluder cages showed poor survival in all 3 years of testing, and this system was not viable for commercial use; survival for any 1 year, or any excluder treatment, was never greater than 25%. In contrast, a 2-year average of 60% queen survival was found for queens that were stored in individual screened wooden cages within queenless colony banks. We found no differences in survival of banked queens that were moved between colonies monthly and those that remained in the same colony for 6 months. The success of these systems required the (a) preparation of colony banks that contained large numbers of adult workers produced by maintaining colonies with two queens during the previous summer, (b) removal of laying queen(s) during the storage period, (c) feeding of colonies well, and (d) insulation of colonies in groups of four, to preserve heat and reduce worker clustering in the winter. Surviving queens from winter storage systems were virtually identical in quality and colony performance to control queens the subsequent season. The annual profit for a commercial beekeeper who does his/her own labour for storage and hires workers for queen production was calculated as $16,625 when 4800 queens are stored over the winter, and sold for $10 each in the spring.

Toxicity of the venom from Nasonia vitripennis (Hymenoptera : Pteromalidae) toward fly hosts, nontarget insects, different developmental stages, and cultured insect cells. Toxicon 31, 755-765, 1993.-A venom preparation from Nasonia vitripennis, a wasp ectoparasitoid of fly pupae, was assayed for lethality in different stages of insects representing ten different orders and in cultured insect cells. In most cases, the motor activity of the injected insects remained completely normal for 1-2 days after the injection and displayed none of the symptoms of paralysis commonly reported for venoms of the Hymenoptera. A natural host, the flesh fly Sarcophaga bullata, was highly sensitive in the pupal stage (ld50 = 5.4 and 5.5 VRE/g for nondiapausing and diapausing pupae, respectively), the stage that is normally parasitized, and larvae and adults were as susceptible to the venom as the pupae. Adults of another fly host, Phaenicia sericata, were nearly as sensitive (ld50 = 6.5 VRE/g), but nonhost adult flies were more tolerant. Among the other orders tested, pupae of several species (Plodia interpunctella, Trichoplusia ni, Tenebrio molitor) were more susceptible to envenomation than larval or adult stages. In fact, the highest sensitivity observed in this study (ld50 = 0.58 VRE/g) was with pupae of the cabbage looper, T. ni, a species that is not a natural host. In contrast, the larvae (ld50 = 7.23 VRE/g) and adults (ld50 = 7.48) of T. ni were far less sensitive. Adults of Nasonia vitripennis were not sensitive to their own venom (ld50 = &gt; 533 VRE/g), although adults of another hymenopteran, Apis mellifera, were suceptible (4.62 VRE/g). Adults of Lymantria dispar, Oncopeltus fasciatus, Aphis nerii, Euborellia annulipes, Diapheromera femorata, Blattella germanica, Periplaneta americana, and Reticulitermes flavipes demonstrated a high tolerance to Nasonia venom. When tested in vitro, the venom caused cultured Lepidoptera (TN-368) and Diptera (NIH SaPe4) cells to round up, swell, and eventually die. The lc50s were 0.0014 and 0.0010 VRE/μl for TN-368 and SaPe4 cells, respectively. Cytotoxicity was observed within 10 min after exposure to lc99 levels of venom, with 100% cell mortality at 100 min for the NIH SaPe4 cells and 24 hr for TN-368 cells. It is possible that the venom component responsible for in vivo and in vitro activities may be different, but results from the cell culture work suggest that this method offers a promising assay for quickly screening venom samples. The high susceptibility of flies and pupae of other insects to the venom, as well as its novel (nonparalytic) action suggest that it may have considerable potential for development as a biopesticide. © 1993.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027160535

Focal injections of cobalt ions into the α‐lobe neuropil of the MB reveal seven clusters of somata located in the protocerebrum and deutocerebrum of each brain hemisphere. These neurons connect the mushroom body neuropil with protocerebral areas and number approximately 400. They contact the layered organization of the α‐lobe at different locations. Some project not only into the α‐lobe, but also into the β‐lobe and pedunculus neuropils. Fifteen cell types which form intraprotocerebral circuits are morphologically described. They can be divided into three categories: (1) unilateral neurons, with projection fields restricted to the ipsilateral protocerebrum; these neurons connect the α‐lobe with areas in the protocerebral lobe and ramify with densely layered arborisations arranged perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the α‐lobe; (2) recurrent neurons, which interconnect subcompartments of the MB, forming loops at different leveles of the neuropil; their arborisations are mainly restricted to the α‐lobe, β‐lobe, pedunculus, and calyces of the ipsilateral MB; they also ramify sparsely around the neuropil of the α‐lobe; and (3) bilateral neurons, which either interconnect both α‐lobes or connect the ipsilateral α‐lobe and protocerebral lobe with the dorsolateral protocerebral lobe of the conntralateral hemisphere.

One possible reason for this is that heterologous signal peptides might be inefficiently recognized by the insect cell protein translocation machinery. This idea was supported by a recent study showing that secretion of a plant protein in the baculovirus system was enhanced when its signal peptide was replaced with an insect-derived signal peptide (Tessier, D. C., Thomas, D. Y., Khouri, H. E., Laliberte, F., and Vernet, T. (1991) Gene (Amst.) 98, 177-183). We have extended these observations by measuring the effects of different signal peptide and signal peptide-prosequence combinations on baculovirus-mediated expression and secretion of human tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). Replacement of the native prepropeptide with signal peptides from a lepidopteran insect secretory protein (cecropin B), a major baculovirus structural glycoprotein (64K), or an abundant, highly conserved lumenal protein of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (GRP78/BiP, a 78-kDa glucose- regulated protein/immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein), had no significant effect on t-PA expression or secretion. The same results were obtained with the signal peptide from honeybee prepromellitin, which was able to enhance secretion of plant propapain (Tessier et al., 1991 (above)). Similar results were obtained when heterologous signal peptides were combined with the native prosequence or when the intact cecropin B pre-prosequence was used. Translational initiation at an upstream, in-frame ATT, which could functionally inactivate any signal peptide, did not explain the low efficiency of t-PA secretion. Finally, deletion of the native signal peptide, prosequence, or both, failed to increase t-PA production. These results showed that insect-derived signal peptides and/or prosequences cannot always enhance the expression and/or secretion of foreign secretory pathway proteins in the baculovirus system. They also suggested that the inability of insect cells to recognize the processing signals in human t-PA efficiently is probably not the major factor preventing its high level production in this system.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027228194

Individual flowers remained attractive to insects for approximately 3 days. Hence approximately 150 visits per raceme are required to ensure adequate pollination.

Previous empirical studies have revealed the mechanisms of the allocation process, but tell us neither the allocation pattern that results nor its effectiveness. To investigate these topics, we develop a system of differential equations that models the allocation process in a hypothetical colony of bees whose behavior closely approximates the observed behavior of real bees. We find that our hypothetical colony tends toward a specific allocation of foragers among flow patches, one in which each forager experiences the same rate of 'value' accumulation regardless of which patch she is visiting (the equal value rate allocation). Moreover, we show that no allocation brings value to the hypothetical colony's hive more than twice as quickly as the equal value rate allocation. To test the accuracy of our model and its predictions about the allocation patterns of honey bee colonies, we use the model to generate predictions about the patterns of dancing and other variables for different flower patches that should be observed in real colonies. The results of one empirical test confirm the model's prediction that at equilibrium the foragers from the different patches will experience equal rates of value accumulation. © 1993 Academic Press.

Therefore, the behavioral activities of individual workers should be integrated with colony state. We here summarize and discuss the relationship between colony state and foraging behavior of individual workers under the provisional assumption that the colony is a unit. We argue that colony state can be described by a number of variables that should relate to fitness components in order to be meaningful. Among the possible candidates, colony population size seems to have an overriding importance in many respects, as shown by its relation to fitness components such as survival probability and reproductive performance. Other important variables include colony demography, i.e. caste or size distributions, nutritional status, or queen number. Each of these variables has been shown to affect fitness components; however, the evidence is rather scanty. We also discuss the evidence that variation in colony state variables relates to variation in individual worker behavior. Nutritional status (i.e. low or high levels of food stores) and colony size have been shown repeatedly to affect individual behavior. However, most of the evidence comes from the honey bee. Some studies suggest that behavioral responses are hierarchically structured. More work needs to be done to investigate the actual mechanisms of integration of individual behavior with colony state. Some knowledge has accumulated about the processes that govern recruitment to food sources. We conclude this review by discussing some concepts and problems for further research. These include the concept of a preferred colony state to which the colony should return after disturbance through the behavioral activities of the workers. Further theoretical elaboration and empirical investigations may help to elucidate whether this concept is useful and necessary. A largely neglected issue concerns the number versus effort problem, i.e. whether individuals should work harder or more workers should be allocated to a task that is in demand. We propose a simple scenario that suggests testable predictions. Finally, we discuss how colony state, individual work load, and the dependence of worker mortality rate on activity level may interact to generate different short-term foraging strategies that workers should adopt. © 1993, Entomological Society of Canada.

Our analysis of cDNA clones indicated that up to 12 of these short peptides (2 kDa) can be generated by processing of single precursor proteins; different isoforms are hereby linked in one promolecule. Assembly of the multipeptide precursors and the putative three-step maturation are strongly reminiscent of yeast alpha-mating factor. Bioactive apidaecins are flanked by the two 'processing' sequences, EAEPEAEP (or variants) and RR; joined together, they form a single unit that is repeated numerous times. The number of such repeats is variable and was reflected in the observed diversity of transcript lengths. Each such transcript is likely to be encoded by a different gene, forming a tight gene cluster. While transcriptional activation upon bacterial challenge is not exceptionally fast, the multigene and multipeptide precursor nature of the apidaecin genetic information allows for amplification of the response, resulting in a real overproduction of peptide antibiotic. Enhanced efficiency of the 'immune' response to bacterial infection through such a mechanism is, to our knowledge, unique among insects.","Amplification; Antibiotic; Apidaecin; Insect immunity; Multipeptide",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027413860

These authors claim that the observed behaviour can be explained without reference to this hypothesis and even without energetic considerations. Moreover, they maintain that the observations support the “information-exchange” hypothesis, an alternative preferred by the authors. In this paper the arguments used by Varjú and Núñez (1991) are shown to be erroneous in several respects. A recurrent problem results from confusing causal and functional questions. In addition, their analysis fails to distinguish between statistically inferred and normative models, misinterprets the nature of observations and misrepresents the predictions of the energy-maximizing hypothesis. Whereas the information-exchange hypothesis is a plausible alternative, the evidence cited by the authors cannot distinguish between the two competing explanations but rather suggests that energy is important.

Inflorescences were visited at least once every 24 h, and visitation frequency was approximately evenly distributed during the day and night. Examination of pollen tube growth from experimental treatments indicated that pollination success was similar from both nocturnal and diurnal visitors. However, nocturnal visitors were more effective at removing pollen from newly opened flowers. The behaviour of mammals at inflorescences was such that they would transfer much more pollen to flowers than other visitors, and probably contact receptive stigmas more often. Overall, mammals were considered to be slightly more effective pollinators than the more obvious daytime visitors, eastern spinebills. Although insects visited regularly, they were thought to be less effective at pollinating flowers than vertebrate visitors. Moths carried very little pollen, and the foraging behaviour of other insects was unlikely to promote much pollination. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

In different experimental combinations of reward rates, color marks, odors and distances of the feeders, the behavior of the test bee was monitored by a computer in real time by several devices installed in each feeder. The test bee optimizes by partially matching its choice behavior to the reward rates of the feeders. The matching behavior differs strongly between ""stay"" flights (the bee chooses the feeder just visited) and ""shift"" flights (the bee chooses one of the three alternative feeders). The probability of stay and shift flights depends on the reward sequence and on the time interval between successive visits. Since functions describing the rising probability of stay flights with rising amounts of sucrose solution just experienced differ for the four feeders, it is concluded that bees develop feeder-specific memories. The choice profiles of shift flights between the three alternative feeders depend on the mean reward rate of the feeder last visited. Good matching is found after visits to the low-reward feeders and poor matching following departure from the high-reward feeders. These results indicate that bees use two different kinds of memories to guide their choice behavior: a transient short-term working memory that is not feeder-specific, and a feeder-specific long-term reference memory. Model calculations were carried out to test this hypothesis. The model was based on a learning rule (the difference rule) developed by Rescorla and Wagner (1972), which was extended to the two forms of memories to predict this operant behavior.

In honeybees, conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex occurs after a single pairing of an odour (conditioned stimulus) with food (unconditioned stimulus)5,6 and shows several higher-order features of conditioning6-8. I report here the identification of an interneuron that mediates the unconditioned stimulus in this associative learning.

The calculation and graphical representation of colour is based on the natural colour vision system of the honeybee, which applies also to several other species of solitary and social bees and wasps. Six categories of colours are defined (U, ultra-violet; U-B, ultra-violet blue; B, blue; B-G, blue-green; G, green; U-G, ultra-violet green) and compared to human colour terms. The whole colour space is fully covered with floral colour signals. Only the U and B colours of highest purity are lacking (Table 1, Figs 1, 2). Basic questions of pollination ecology are addressed in relation to flower colours as signals for insect pollinators. A statistical analysis is used to examine the correlation between flower traits (e.g. size, tube length, nectar production), between morphometric parameters of pollinators (size, tongue length) and between flower and pollinator traits (Figs 4-12). The tube length of the corolla highly correlates with the size of the corolla and the flower nectar production. The bee size correlates with their respective tongue lengths. A very loose correlation, however, is found between the tube length of flowers and the tongue length of bees which were observed visiting the respective flowers (Fig. 5). This indicates that bees of various sizes visit flowers of a large range of size, because most bee species and only very few (in the range of 10 out of more than 1200 species) may specialize in one plant species. A general trend towards higher frequencies of U-B and B colours is found for flowers predominantly visited by hymenoptera (Fig. 7). B-G and U-G colours are more frequent in flowers which are designed such that they can be exploited by flies and beetles. The relative highest frequency of U-B and lowest frequency of B-G colours are found in flowers visited predominantly by large bees. Such flowers typically have corollas with long tubes (Fig. 14), large corollas (Fig. 13), corolla shapes with hidden or protected nectar (Fig. 12, two-lipped and funnel and nail-shaped), zygomorphic corollas (Fig. 13), vertically arranged corollas (Fig. 15) and flowers which offer predominantly or exclusively nectar (Fig. 18). The clear separation in the frequency distribution of colour categories between fly- and beetle-visited flowers on the one hand and hymenoptera-visited flowers on the other is interpreted to indicate two different syndromes of colour signals, those for pollinators which shuttle back and forth between their nest site and the food sites (hymenoptera), and those wandering around between flowers and resting on flowers (flies, beetles). These two floral colour syndromes are also characterized by the different choice strategies of their pollinators. Hymenoptera are known to use their memory of previous appetitive learning particularly effectively, whereas flies and beetles appear to refer less effectively to an individually acquired memory. The distributions of colour loci for plants growing in the desert and Mediterranean landscape show a tendency to shift their respective colour loci away from that of the dominant background (Fig. 9). This is interpreted as a contrast-enhancing phenomenon. Since the backgrounds in the two habitats do not differ very much in their spectral reflection, the shift of the floral colour loci is relatively small. The frequency of colours was also analysed with respect to the peak blooming time of the respective plant (Fig. 10), the growth height of the plant (Fig. I I) and the systematic groups of plants (Fig. 19). The main results are: Trees have higher proportions of B-G colours (human colour white). In wintertime (February) flowers are relatively more frequently B-G and less frequently U. The highest flower colour diversity appears at peak blooming time (March). With respect to systematic groups of plants, some families have colours spread all over the colour space of bees, while others have more or less restricted colour areas. Our results support the notion that a pollination market dominated by hymenopteran insects is a highly competitive one, which is characterized by two pollinator capacities: (a) the general, highly resolving trichromatic colour vision system with uv, blue and green receptors (excluding the red region of the spectrum), and (b) the strong individual learning capacity for floral features which guides the pollinators according to reward experience rather than by innate search images. Under these conditions floral colours are highly adaptive advertising signals which are selected by fast-learning pollinators for contrast optimization to the background and between each other.",,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027338645

In addition, the movement of bees within the winter cluster was examined. There was no difference in pollen content and proteolytic activity between bees from the centre or margin of the cluster, nor did the 2 groups show a preference for staying at the centre or on the margin of the winter cluster. Compared to 8-9-day-old bees in summer, the amount of pollen in the midguts was smaller by a factor of 100-1000, but the degree of pollen digestion in the midgut and the rectum was significantly greater; the proteolytic activity in the midgut was approximately a quarter. The more efficient utilization in spite of lower proteolytic activity might be due to pollen staying longer in the midgut. Foragers in summer also consume only minimal amounts of pollen but have a smaller degree of utilization than winter bees. The reduced pollen consumption rate, and efficient utilization in spite of lower proteolytic activity are useful adaptations to the reduced availability of pollen and reduced protein metabolism which bees experience during the winter. © 1993.","Apis; Nutrition; Pollen; Protein; Winter",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001334525

In contrast, honey samples from most Equatorial regions and Australia are generally devoid of propolis-derived flavonoids, showing only flavonoids from other plant sources. However, several honey samples from Central and South America and from New Zealand do contain the flavonoids characteristic of propolis.

A novel insect signal sequence, the honey‐bee (Apis mellifera) prepromelittin secretory sequence, was used to aid in the post‐translational modifications, glycosylation and secretion of recombinant human TNF‐beta. Human TNF‐beta cDNA was cloned using the insect baculovirus vector pAcC4s. Expression of the human TNF‐beta was regulated by the insect Autographa californica nuclear‐polyhedrosis‐virus polyhedrin promoter. The 5′ end of the TNF‐beta cDNA was fused to the honey‐bee prepromelittin signal sequence on the baculovirus vector. Insect [Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9)] cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus secreted high levels of recombinant human TNF‐beta into the culture medium. The amount of TNF‐beta secreted by the Sf9 cells was estimated to be 28 micrograms of TNF‐beta/ml of culture medium at 60–72 h post infection. The secreted human TNF‐beta was a 22.5 kDa polypeptide which was glycosylated. Amino acid sequencing of the N‐terminus of the recombinant human TNF‐beta purified from the infected Sf9‐cell culture confirmed that the secreted product was indeed human TNF‐beta. This demonstrates that the honey‐bee prepromelittin signal sequence was efficiently recognized and accurately cleaved in the Sf9 insect cells. The insect‐derived TNF‐beta exhibited a high cytotoxic activity similar to that of the native human TNF‐beta when assessed by cytotoxic assays using murine L929 cells. Thus the insect baculovirus expression vector can be used for the production of abundant quantities of biologically active, glycosylated human TNF‐beta protein. 1993 The Swiss Political Science Review",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027731402

Among the invertebrates, special attention is paid to the advantages as well as the shortcomings of the fly Drosophila melanogaster, the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the honey bee Apis mellifera, the sea hare Aplysia californica, the octopus Octopus vulgaris, and the squid Loligo pealei. Among vertebrates, the focus is on Homo sapiens, the mouse Mus musculus, the rat Rattus norvegicus, the cat Felis catus, the macaque monkey Macaca fascicularis, the barn owl Tyto alba, and the zebrafish Brachydanio rerio. Vertebrate nervous systems have also been compared in fossil vs. extant organism. I conclude that complex nervous systems arose in the Early Cambrian via a big bang that was underpinned by a modular method of construction involving massive pleiotropy of gene circuits. This rapidity of construction had enormous implications for the degrees of freedom that were subsequently available to evolving nervous systems. I also conclude that at the level of neuronal populations and interactions of neuropiles there is no model system between phyla except at the basic macromolecular level. Further, I argue that to achieve a significant understanding of the functions of extant nervous systems we need to concentrate on fewer organisms in greater depth and manipulate genomes via transgenic technologies to understand the behavioral outputs that are possible from an organism.

Four observation colonies were studied during the honey bee migration season (November-May), at which time the availability of blooming species was reduced. Two of the colonies (colonies 1 & 2) migrated during the study period, while the remaining two (colonies 3 & 4) did not. During the 4-6 weeks preceding the onset of migration preparations, colonies 1 & 2 exhibited increasing population sizes, high levels of brood production with low brood mortality, relatively large stores of food, and increasing mass. In contrast, the populations of colonies 3 & 4 did not increase, brood-rearing activity was erratic and lower, brood mortality was higher, food stores became depleted and colony mass declined. Both colonies 3 & 4 ceased rearing brood, and colony 3 died of starvation. Colony foraging activity was examined by monitoring waggle-dance activity 2-3 days each week. For 4-6 weeks before the onset of migration in colonies 1 & 2, daily foraging areas and mean daily foraging distances became increasingly large and variable. Colonies 3 & 4 exhibited foraging patterns similar to those observed for colonies 1 & 2 preceding migration. There was no clear association between 7 weather parameters examined and migration behavior. These data suggest that migration is influenced by an interaction of intra-colony demographics, food reserves and foraging patterns. Migration may be feasible only for those colonies that possess (1) a population of appropriate size and age structure to compensate for the natural attrition of older workers during the emigration process, and (2) sufficient food reserves for long-distance travel and the establishment of a new nest. Changing foraging patterns may reflect a deteriorating foraging environment, which may trigger the onset of migration preparations, provided that colony demographics and food reserves are conducive. Colonies that show decreased brood production, higher brood mortality and reduced food stores may be incapable of migrating, even when experiencing deteriorating foraging conditions. Rather, such colonies may have a greater chance of survival if they attempt to persist in a given area. © 1992 Birkhäuser Verlag.","absconding; Apis mellifera scutellata; foraging; Honey bee; migration; waggle dance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0342540504

Reproductive success (RS) is higher in drone cells than in worker cells. Although the mites are capable of discriminating between the cell types, the less favorable worker cells are also parasitized. A model is proposed that explains the acceptance of worker cells by density-dependent reduction of RS if more than one Varroa enters a brood cell. Calculations were based on simulated distributions of Varroa on brood combs. Assuming that mites infesting brood cells would always accept drone cells, but would only sometimes accept worker cells, the optimal rate of worker cell acceptance was determined. While at low infestation levels and high fractions of drone cells selection would favor the parasitization of drone brood cells only, mixed strategies would result if infestation is high and/or drone cells are scarce. The model calculations were applied to data on brood cell availability in European colonies during one annual season, including seasonal shifts of selection intensity and direction. On average, accepting worker cells would be advantageous when there are approximately 300 or more mites within a colony, which would be within the natural range of worker cell acceptance at densities of approximately 1000 Varroa mites per colony. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027097276

After introduction of these mites into recently sealed worker brood cells the average number of offspring of reproducing swollen mites was similar to that of naturally invaded mites, but the non-swollen mites produced a significantly lower number of offspring. This suggests that the oviposition of adult mites is stimulated by a preceding stay on adult bees. When (non-swollen) mites collected from brood cells were kept for 35 days in Eppendorf test tubes containing a larva or a pupa, their reproduction was similar to that of swollen mites. Contact of young mites, collected from brood cells, with adult bees was not essential for the initiation of oviposition. However, the number of offspring of reproducing mites, even after a third or fourth introduction into brood cells, was as a rule lower than that of mites that had been in contact with adult bees. The period of artificial introduction into sealed brood cells proved to be essential for subsequent reproduction. When introduced 48-52 h or 72-76 h after cell sealing, the mites did not produce eggs. When introduced 0-4 h after cell sealing a high percentage of the mites reproduced.

Mudd Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14853, NY, United States","The nectar foragers of a honey bee colony, upon return to the hive, sometimes perform a mysterious behavior called the tremble dance. In performing this dance, a forager shakes her body back and forth, at the same time rotating her body axis by about 50° every second or so, all the while walking slowly across the comb. During the course of a dance, which on average lasts 30 min, the bee travels about the broodnest portion of the hive. It is shown experimentally that a forager will reliably perform this dance if she visits a highly profitable nectar source but upon return to the hive experiences great difficulty finding a food-storer bee to take her nectar. This suggests that the message of the tremble dance is ""I have visited a rich nectar source worthy of greater exploitation, but already we have more nectar coming into the hive than we can handle."" It is also shown experimentally that the performance of tremble dances is followed quickly by a rise in a colony's nectar processing capacity and (see Nieh, in press and Kirchner, submitted) by a drop in a colony's recruitment of additional bees to nectar sources. These findings suggest that the tremble dance has multiple meanings. For bees working inside the hive, its meaning is apparently ""I should switch to the task of processing nectar,"" while for bees working outside the hive (gathering nectar), its meaning is apparently ""I should refrain from recruiting additional foragers to my nectar source."" Hence it appears that the tremble dance functions as a mechanism for keeping a colony's nectar processing rate matched with its nectar intake rate at times of greatly increased nectar influx. Evidently the tremble dance restores this match in part by stimulating a rise in the processing rate, and in part by inhibiting any further rise in the intake rate. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027091796

This suggests that the genomic organisation of Hymenoptera could be due to the elimination of deleterious Tn in haploid males. We have used restriction-fragment length polymorphism analysis to show that nondeleterious Tn are present in the DNA (rDNA) encoding ribosomal RNA of twelve species of Hymenoptera. Sequence analysis of the 28S rDNA type-I and type-II insertion-rich regions of 80 species showed that this region is very highly conserved (95.8%). A consensus sequence and restriction map of the rDNA region were established. These sequence data were used to develop a strategy for detecting inserted elements in the rDNA fragments containing type-I or type-II insertion sites, and this strategy was used to screen twelve hymenopteran species and four non-Hymenoptera control species. The rDNA fragments from the Hymenoptera and control species contained inserted sequences in the area where type-I and type-II elements are inserted in the 28S rDNA retrotransposon-rich region of Diptera and Lepidoptera. The hymenopteran genomes therefore appear to contain repeated elements, the mobility and nature of which remain to be determined. © 1992.","bees; male-haploid system; mobile elements; Parasitoid wasp; retrotransposon",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026492452

In the present study we synthesized three caffeic acid esters, namely methyl caffeate (MC), phenylethyl caffeate (PEC) and phenylethyl dimethylcaffeate (PEDMC) and tested them against the 3,2′-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl, (DMAB, a colon and mammary carcinogen)-induced mutagenecity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98 and TA 100. Also, the effect of these agents on the growth of human colon adenocarcinoma, HT-29 cells and activities of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) was studied. Mutagenicity was induced in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98 and TA 100 plus S9 activation using 5 and 10 μg DMAB and antimutagenic activities of 0-150 μM MC, 0-60 μM PEC and 0-80 μM PEDMC were determined. The results indicate that MC, PEC and PEDMC were not mutagenic in the Salmonella tester system. DMAB-induced mutagenicity was significantly inhibited with 150 μM MC, 40-60 μM PEC and 40-80 μM PEDMC in both tester systems. Treatment of HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells with &gt; 150 μM MC, 30 μM PEC and 20 μM PEDMC significantly inhibited the cell growth and syntheses of RNA, DNA and protein. ODC and PTK activities were also inhibited in HT-29 cells treated with different concentrations of MC, PEC and PEDMC.

The genomic DNA samples from two parental bees, a haploid drone and a diploid queen, were screened for polymorphism with 68 different tennucleotide primers of random sequence. Parents were scored for the presence or absence of individual bands. An average of 6.3 bands and 1.3 polymorphisms for presence/absence were observed per primer between the parents. Thirteen of these primers were used to determine the inheritance of RAPD marker alleles in the resulting progeny and in haploid drones from a daughter queen. Four types of polymorphisms were observed. Polymorphisms for band presence/absence as well as for band brightness were inherited as dominant markers, meeting Mendelian expectations in haploid and diploid progeny. Polymorphisms for fragment-length were also observed. These segregated in a near 1:1 ratio in drone progeny. The last type of polymorphism was manifested as a diploid-specific band. Mixing of amplification products after PCR showed that the diploid-specific band was the result of heteroduplex formation from the DNA of alternate alleles in heterozygotes. In two of the four cases of heteroduplex formation, the alternative alleles were manifested as small fragment-length polymorphisms, resulting in co-dominant markers. This is the first demonstration that a proportion of RAPD markers are not inherited in a dominant fashion. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Genetic markers; Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002485119

The manipulative option results from the non-clonal genetic structure of insect societies and necessarily introduces conflict into insect societies. This paper examines conflict over male production, queen-rearing, and sex allocation for monogynous hymenopteran societies. The structure of conflict is shown to vary according to the particular conflict, queen mating frequency, and other factors. Importantly, there are conditions under which the actual conflict (i.e. the actual manipulation of reproduction) is predicted to be markedly less than the potential conflict (i.e. all the manipulations potentially beneficial to individual workers given the kin-value asymmetries within the colony). For example, when manipulation is costly (i.e. reduces colony productivity), or relatively ineffective (i.e. because of limitations to kin recognition ability, or counter manipulations such as worker policing) it may be selectively disfavored. Furthermore, low actual conflict may be characteristic of certain sub-sets of workers (e.g. foragers) or certain phases of colony growth (e.g. the ergonomic phase). As a result, a pluralistic rather than a typological perspective on conflict in insect societies is suggested. Low actual conflict may facilitate the evolution of colony- or group-level adaptations (i.e. attributes of individuals which have evolved to enable them to function synergistically as a colony or group, such as social foraging in honey bees and army ants), despite the non-clonal genetic structure of most insect societies. However, low levels of actual conflict between individuals need not result in group-level adaptations. The term community of interest is suggested to describe groups within which there is little or no actual conflict, whether or not group-level adaptations occur. The recently revived term superorganism is problematic, because it is often used in a categorical way, to describe whole societies. This difficulty is partly overcome by the pluralistic outlook, which would favor statements such as ""foraging in the honey bee shows superorganismic properties"" (i.e. group-level adaptations), rather than typological thinking such as ""the honey bee colony is a superorganism"". © 1992 Academic Press Limited All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026616332

Bees exposed during the night harbored a significantly higher number of mites (718) when compared with the daytime bees (88 mites) (n=14 day/night cycles utilizing 33 colonies). On 4 days of an 8-day study, three test colonies were closed during the daytime to eliminate foraging flights. Thus equal numbers of bees were present in the colonies during the day and night sample periods. These 4 flightless days were compared to 4 free-flight days and mite dispersal rates were not significantly different. Additionally, the movement of bees on the combs of four glass-walled observation hives was quantified on 10 days at 08:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00, 24:00 and 04:00 h. Bee movement at 24:00 and 04:00 h was significantly lower than the other observation times. Movement of host bees may be one factor involved in the increased nighttime mite dispersals. These findings do not support the hypothesis that the absence of foraging bees during the day reduces the bee to bee contact time, thus reducing mite dispersals between host bees. Differential diurnal activity levels between host bees and mite parasites was demonstrated. The exact role of host-bee behavior and/or mite behavior in the nighttime dispersal patterns observed, remains for further investigation. © 1992 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026616692

It is assumed that summer workers choose a foraging strategy that maximizes colony population by the end of the season subject to the constraint that enough nectar has been stored to sustain the adult population overwinter. The optimal foraging strategy is derived with respect to the number of flowers visited during one foraging trip. A forager that visits many flowers collects a substantial amount of nectar but the probability that the worker returns alive from the excursion decreases accordingly. Using dynamic modelling, I explore the effects on colony growth of colony population, colony energy requirements and mortality rate while foraging. The model shows that when the expected rate of increase in nectar reserves is low, for instance in small colonies or when mortality rate rises rapidly with foraging intensity, workers collect more nectar during each foraging trip. The increase in foraging activity is realized at the expense of colony growth. The main finding is that depending on colony status the foraging strategy that maximizes worker population implies visits to almost any number of flowers. This is in sharp contrast to predictions from traditional foraging models where foraging intensity is assumed to cluster around values that maximize net rate or efficiency. The model suggests that strategies that cluster around rate and efficiency maximization should be viewed as particular solutions to a more general problem. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027086220

Determination of residues of organic and inorganic substances in bees (Apis mellifera) and in their products is one of effective possibilities of environmental pollution monitoring. Our work was aimed at the study of mercury levels in bees and their products. Mercury levels were determined in the head, abdomen and thorax of bees (Apis mellifera) from 20 bee populations coming from industrially contaminated areas with a dominant load of mercury (10 populations) and from uncontaminated areas. Mercury levels were determined simultaneously in honey coming from both contaminated and uncontaminated areas. The following mercury levels were found in bees from the contaminated area: heads 0.029-0.385 mg/kg, thorax 0.028-0.595 mg/kg and abdomen 0.083-2.255 mg/kg. Mercury levels in samples from uncontaminated areas ranged from 0.004 to 0.024 mg/kg in the heads, from 0.004 to 0.008 mg/kg in the thorax and from 0.008 to 0.020 mg/kg in the abdomen.

Colonies responded to low pollen storage conditions by increasing pollen intake rates 54% relative to high pollen storage conditions, demonstrating a direct relationship between pollen storage levels and foraging effort. Approximately 80% of the difference in pollen intake rates was accounted for by variation in individual foraging effort, via changes in foraging activity and individual pollen load size. An additional 20% resulted from changes in the proportion of the foraging population collecting pollen. Under both high and low pollen storage treatments, colonies returned pollen storage levels to pre-experimental levels within 16 days, suggesting that honey bees regulate pollen storage levels around a homeostatic set point.

Dfd protein is first stained in the prospective gnathal region of the cellular blastoderm. This circumferential band corresponds to the distribution of Dfd mRNA described earlier, and to the blastodermal Dfd expression pattern in Drosophila. Using an antibody against the engrailed (en) protein of Drosophila, we found that at the beginning of gastrulation Dfd expression in the honeybee, as in Drosophila, is restricted to the future intercalary, mandibular and maxillary segments. During gastrulation, the mesodermal nuclei loose the Dfd label gradually from anterior to posterior, and in the ectoderm the most posterior ventral cells loose Dfd while retaining en staining; thus, in contrast to what has been described for Drosophila, the posterior Dfd expression border seems to move forward ventrally to the parasegmental boundary within the maxillary segment. In the late germ band, the lateral tips of the Dfd-expressing band are connected across the dorsal side by a row of amnion cells with strongly staining large nuclei. After dorsal closure, a narrow stripe of Dfd-staining dorsal cells behind the neck region may indicate that the maxillary segment contributes to the dorsal body wall posterior to the head capsule. Thus, apart from some minor deviations, the Dfd expression pattern in the honeybee strongly resembles that in Drosophila prior to head involution. This is compatible with the assumption that head involution (which is a special adaption in higher dipterans) ensues after a rather conserved course of early head development in which Dfd appears to play a basic role. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.","Antibody staining; Deformed; Embryogenesis; Homeotic genes; Honeybee",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026645313

The annual cycle occurred in three distinct periods. The swarming season occurred from October-November, following two to three months of intense brood production, and coincided with the end of peak forage abundance. The migration season occurred from November-May and coincided with reduced and variable floral resources. During the migration season, brood production and food storage were generally low but quite variable from month to month, and swarms passing over the study area at this time traveled in an easterly direction. The migration season was followed by the establishment period (June-September), in which large numbers of new colonies traveling from the west moved into the study area. The establishment period coincided with, and slightly preceded, the period of peak forage abundance, and colonies devoted resources collected at this time almost entirely to brood rearing, which culminated in swarm production.

Performance of intranidal behavior patterns, brood cell production and the processing and storage of nectar, were studied during a control and a wax-deprived period. Experimental wax deprivation consisted of regular controlled removal of storage pots and their contents. Stored carbohydrate concentration and storage pot mass declined during the wax-deprived period. Behavior was measured by sampling for a complete ethogram at seven intranidal areas. In comparison with Apis mellifera, M. favosa appeared to be more sensitive to stress, with a distinct reallocation of effort between tasks. The significant increase under stress of brood production and brood-rearing behavior patterns observed was previously also found in Apis. Self-oriented behavior patterns declined under stressed circumstances. Involucrum construction declined in wax-deprived Melipona colonies. Relatively low rates of walking behavior in general in Melipona suggest a low mean free distance between tasks. These results are of particular interest in relation to the basically different nest structure of stingless bees, e.g. very distinct areas for brood production and the processing and storage of food. This architecture of stingless bee nests appeared to influence strongly their specific responses to wax deprivation. © 1992 Birkhäuser Verlag.","division of labor; Ergonomics; Melipona favosa; stingless bees",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0039856180

Banacha 12/16, 90-237 LódźPoland","The interaction of bee venom melittin with erythrocyte membrane ghosts has been investigated by means of fluorescence quenching of membrane tryptophan residues, fluorescence polarization and ESR spectroscopy. It has been revealed that melittin induces the disorders in lipid-protein matrix both in the hydrophobic core of bilayer and at the polar/non-polar interface of melittin complexed with erythrocyte membranes. The peptide has been found to act most efficiently at the concentration of the order of 10-10 mol/mg membrane protein. The apparent distance separating the membrane tryptophan and bound 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulphonate (ANS) molecules is decreased upon melittin binding, which results in a significant increase of the maximum energy transfer efficiency. Significant changes in the fluorescence anisotropy of both 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene and 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulphonate bound to erythrocyte ghosts, which have been observed in the presence of melittin and crude venom, indicate membrane lipid bilayer rigidization. The effect of crude honey bee venom has been found to be of similar magnitude as the effect of pure melittin at the concentration of 10-10 mol/mg membrane protein. Using two lipophilic spin labels, methyl 5-doxylpalmitate and 16-doxylstearic acid, we found that melittin at its increasing concentrations induces a well marked rigidization in the deeper regions of lipid bilayer, whereas the effect of rigidization near the membrane surface maximizes at the melittin concentration of 10-10 mol/mg (10-4 mol melittin per mole of membrane phospholipid). The decrease in the ratio hw hs of maleimide and the rise in relative rotational correlation time (τc) of iodoacetamid spin label, indicate that melittin effectively immobilizes membrane proteins in the plane of the lipid bilayer. We conclude that melittin-induced rigidization of the lipid bilayer may induce a reorganization of lipid assemblies as well as the rearrangements in membrane protein pattern and consequently the alterations in lipid-protein interactions. Thus, the interaction of melittin with erythrocyte membranes is supposed to produce local conformational changes in membranes, which are discussed in the connection with their significance during the synergistic action of melittin and phospholipase of bee venom on red blood cells. © 1992.","Erythrocyte membrane; Fluorescence polarization; Fluorescence quenching; Lipid-protein interaction; Melittin; Spin labelling",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026519429

Here, we present evidence supporting the hypothesis that an individual's pattern of task specialization is affected not only by her own genotype, but, indirectly, by the genotypes of her nestmates. Workers from two strains of honey bees, one selected for high pollen hoarding, the other for low pollen hoarding, were observed in colonies of their respective parent strains and in colonies of the other strain. Worker genotype and host-colony type affected foraging activity. Workers from the high strain fostered in low-strain colonies returned with pollen on 75.6% of total foraging trips, while workers from the high strain fostered in high-strain colonies returned with pollen on 53.5% of total trips. Workers from the low strain fostered in low-strain colonies returned with pollen on 34.8% of total foraging trips while workers from the low strain fostered in high-strain colonies returned with pollen on 2.6% of total trips. Similar results were obtained in a second experiment. We suggest that workers influence the behavior of their nestmates indirectly through their effects on the shared colony environment. The asymmetry seen in the response of workers from these strains to the two types of colony environments also suggests that these genotypes exhibit different norms of reaction. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027045546

Within the cytoplasmic bridges, the filaments are regularly spaced and tightly apposed to the ER membrane. In addition, actin filaments are deployed close to the microvillar bases to form a loose web. Actin filaments are scarce in cell areas remote from the rhabdom; these areas contain microtubule-associated ER domains.

The responses of these sensilla (i.e. rates of firing) to each of the six odorants were compared to responses to odorant-free solvent controls and were analysed in three ways. First, the summed responses across all placodes, as might occur in an electroantennogram, was significantly different from the controls only in the case of citral, geraniol and linalool. Secondly, principal component and cluster analyses of the responses of individual whole placodes revealed a few specialized placodes, but most placodes responded to more than one of the compounds and no neat categorization emerged. Thirdly, using spike height and, to some extent, spike shape to separate the responses of individual placodes into units that more closely represented the activity of single neurons revealed a greater level of specialization, although many generalist subplacode units still remained. A comparison of the distribution of interspike intervals revealed no difference between generalist and specialist units. However, a comparison of these distributions at the placode versus subplacode level suggest that receptor neurons within placodes may pace one another so as to not fire simultaneously.

The Pb concentration, expressed on a dry weight base was determined in relation to the distribution over the body, the accumulation time, the clearance and the exposure dose. Pb is concentrated in the digestive system with the midgut accounting for 67% and the rectum for 27% of the accumulated metal. The barrier function of this system is thus corroborated in honeybees. Pb accumulation happens slowly in young bees which feed mainly on pollen; once they switch from pollen to nectar there is a sharp rise in their Pb content. After the 26th day a limit of tissue accumulation seems to be reached. Pb accumulation is equally efficient when the contamination starts at a forager age. Pb clearance is slower than expected; after 12 days only one third of the initial lead burden has been cleared. The Pb concentration in the animals increases significantly with the Pb concentration in the sugar syrup which they are fed, except at the highest dose of 50 mg/l. The possible use of honeybees as biomonitors for Pb pollution seems promising from these results. © 1992.","honeybees; lead; pollution",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026615327

Experiments were completed by endoscopic observation of the insects in the visible and the near infrared range and by acoustical monitoring and subsequent frequency analysis of various locomotor activities. Direct calorimetric results of this paper are compared with data of indirect calorimetry from the literature using a respiratory quotient of 1.00 and 21.13 J consumed. Agreements between both methods are generally good. The results show that weight-specific heat production rates increase with age of worker bees by a factor of 5.6 at 30 °C, 3.7 at 25 °C and 40.0 at 20 °C. In groups of foragers the heat production decreases with growing group size to around 6% of the value for an isolated bee. The presence of a fertile queen or of brood reduces the heat output of a small worker group significantly. Adult drones exhibit a much higher metabolic rate (up to 19.7-fold at 20 °C) than juveniles with strong fluctuations in the power-time curves. Fertile queens show a less pronounced heat production rate than virgin queens (54% at 30 °C, 87% at 25 °C and 77% at 20 °C). Calorimetric unrest is much higher for young than for adult queens. Heat production is very low in both uncapped and capped brood and less than 30% of that of a newly emerged worker. In most cases temperature showed a significant influence on the metabolic level, although its sign was not homogeneous between the castes or even within them. Locomotor activities are easily recorded by the acoustic frequency spectrum (0-7.5 kHz) and in good agreement with endoscopic observations and calorimetric traces. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera carnica; Calorimetry; Energy metabolism; Honey bee castes; Honey bees",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001312810

(2) Several initial findings suggested that foragers might indeed compare dances. First, dance information is arrayed in the hive in a way that facilitates comparison-making: dances for different flower patches are performed close together in time and space. Second, food-source quality is coded in the dances, in terms of dance length (number of circuits per dance). Third, dances to natural food sources vary in length by more than 2 orders of magnitude, indicating that the quality of natural food sources varies greatly. Fourth, foragers seeking a new food source follow several dances before exiting the hive (though only one dance is followed closely). (3) Nevertheless, a critical test for comparison-making revealed that foragers evidently do not compare dances. A colony was given two feeders that were equidistant from the hive but different in profitability. If foragers do not compare dances, then the proportion of recruits arriving at the richer feeder should match the proportion of dance circuits for the richer feeder. This is the pattern that we found in all 11 trials of the experiment. (4) We suggest that the reason foragers do not compare dances is that a colony's foraging success is greater if its foragers distribute themselves among the various food sources being advertised in the hive than if they crowd themselves on the one, best source. (5) Food-source selection by honey bee colonies is a democratic decision-making process. This study reveals that this selection process is organized to function effectively even though each member of the democracy possesses incomplete information about the available choices. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027047349

Colonies newly established in the spring showed a significant, dose-dependent increase in the number of foragers gathering pollen, and individual pollen foragers returned to the nest with larger pollen loads. These two effects combined resulted in a doubling of the amount of pollen brought into colonies by foraging bees. Brood rearing also increased, but not significantly.

The distribution of coumaphos (the active component of perizin), fed to individual honeybees, in the honey stomach, haemolymph, midgut and rectum was studied over time. Concurrently, we investigated changes occurring in the haemolymph volume due to the ingestion of perizin, and we examined the influence of a Nosema apisinfection on the survival of bees that had been fed perizin. The maximum amount of coumaphos in the haemolymph was found 4h after ingestion, but it was only 2–3% of the total amount recovered. After 15 min 55% of the total amount of the coumaphos recovered was in the honey stomach and available for distribution within the colony by trophallaxis, while 45% had already passed the proventriculus. Ultimately the coumaphos accumulated in the rectum. The volume of the haemolymph significantly increased in bees which were fed perizin compared with bees which were fed syrup and with non‐fed bees. The lethal dose of coumaphos to 3‐day‐old bees was three times higher than the lethal dose for 18‐ and 1‐day‐old bees. The number of Nosema apis spores in the alimentary canal was not correlated with the survival of the bees that were fed perizin. It is concluded that coumaphos can act as a systemic agent and can be distributed to other individuals in a colony through trophallaxis, but these effects are limited to a maximum period of 12h after ingestion.

The eggs were obtained from a section of comb, containing both worker- and drone-sized cells, on which the queen was confined for 24 h. Egg length and width fluctuated significantly in both colonies throughout the experimental period. There was no statistical difference between sexes, and eggs destined to produce drones during the swarming season were not necessarily larger. Dry weights of drones were measured at 14-day intervals during spring (1990, Lake Placid, FL) and summer (1989 and 1990, Ithaca, NY), using a pool of 12–15 colonies. Weights varied significantly throughout all the sampling periods. The 1989 (NY) and 1990 (FL) data showed a tendency for drones to become lighter after swarming and heavier during swarming. The more extensive sampling in 1990 (NY) showed a mean drone dry weight varying from 56.86 mg to 30.71 mg, but there was no association with swarming and similar changes occurred also in worker weights. © 1992 International Bee Research Association.","Apis mellifera; Drone honey bees; Egg size; Seasonal variation; Swarming; Weight; Worker honey bees",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-21144467200

A metallic cylinder charged with four different intensities (chosen in the range measured on living bees) of either positive or negative sign was used as a lure. The mite's movements in the vicinity of the cylinder was videotaped and subsequently digitized. Spatial and temporal dimensions of the paths were computed by a specially designed analysis programme. The frequency and nature of the contacts with the lure were also noted. A two-way ANOVA indicated no significant differences in the characteristics of the paths between charges of different intensities. However, the charge sign was found to influence the following characteristics: immobility, velocity, turning angle standard deviation and sinuosity. In addition, the frequency with which the mite contacted and climbed on the cylinder was higher in the case of negative charge. We suggest that the mites are not merely passively attracted towards the lure by the action of electrical forces. Rather, the detection of charges triggers a change in the movements of the animal which increases the probability to contact its host. © 1992.","Apis mellifera; Electrical charges; host finding; trajectometry; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249013599

Since the fitness of Africanized drones is higher than that of European drones, European and African mitotypes are expected to be polymorphic and consequently unreliable as diagnostic tools to discriminate between the two types.

Latency of response to each target was measured during the training, and at the conclusion, preference was measured in an unrewarded choice test. Analysis of the latencies showed both a prospective effect (faster response to the 50% target than to the 20% target) and a nonassociative retrospective effect (faster response after leaving the 20% target than after leaving the 50% target) reminiscent of the frustration effect in rats. The results both for prospective latency and for choice can be understood on the simple theory that the attractiveness of a target depends on the strength of its association with sucrose and that the effect of concentration is on asymptotic strength.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026832412

The 19 mtDNA types detected are clustered in three major phylogenetic lineages. These clades correspond well to three groups of populations with distinct geographical distributions: branch A for African subspecies (intermissa, monticola, scutellata, andansonii and capensis), branch C for North Mediterranean subspecies (caucasica, carnica and ligustica) and branch M for the West European populations (mellifera subspecies). These results partially confirm previous hypotheses based on morphometrical and allozymic studies, the main difference concerning North African populations, now assigned to branch A instead of branch M. The pattern of spatial structuring suggests the Middle East as the centre of dispersion of the species, in accordance with the geographic areas of the other species of the same genus.

In sealed honey the cytoplasm had a strong tendency to crystallize and reserve materials such as starch and lipids started to show some symptoms of degradation; the apertures normally appeared closed and the cytoplasm did not protrude in any case. It is suggested that the osmotic pressure of unsealed honey leads to turgescent pressure which causes the cytoplasm to protrude through the apertures, and that the cytoplasm is preserved by pyknosis of the cytoplasmic contents.

Venom from each of these bees was studied with isoelectric focusing and functional assays for phospholipase A2 and melittin. Phospholipase concentrations in individual EU bee venoms varied between 1.8% and 27.4% (wt/wt). The melittin concentration in EU bee venom varied less and, on the average, was found to be much lower than previously reported. There was an eightfold to ninefold difference between lowest and highest venom sac DW contents, suggesting the possibility of highly variable venom delivery from bee stings. One EU bee contained &gt;300 μg of venom, three times the recommended maintenance dose for venom immunotherapy. Isoelectric focusing also demonstrated large differences between individual bees, with respect to major and minor components of their venoms. Africanized bees contained significantly less venom but more phospholipase than did EU bees. Bee venoms from different colonies differed in their DW content and in their concentrations of phospholipase and melittin. The results are relevant to the uncertainty of responses from sting challenges and field stings in allergic patients and massive stinging attacks on normal subjects. © 1992 Mosby-Year Book, Inc.

The relationship between the fluctuation in total quantity of sugar available in the nectar of Carduus acanthoides inflorescences and the foraging behaviour of honeybees Apis mellifera ligustica was studied in a patch under natural conditions. Every day, three inflorescence populations coexisted, one for each day of the inflorescence life‐span. The maximum availability of sugar occurred in second‐day capitula from 12.00 to 15.00 hours. Bee arrivals at the patch were positively correlated with the total availability of sugar as determined by sampling. Bees responded to variation in the availability of sugar by visiting the inflorescence stage that was most rewarding at that time of day. Early in the morning, when the frequency of visits was low, the bees worked the third‐day capitula, which were the best available choice at that time. Similarly, beginning at 12.00 hours, bees switched to second‐day capitula. At the end of the day, some bees switched to third‐day capitula where a slightly superior quantity of sugar could be obtained from a small number of florets although other bees continued to work the second‐day capitula. Individual bees switched to another inflorescence stage after a high proportion of their visits to a small number of capitula of one kind had provided a low reward. The number of florets visited per minute per bee varied throughout the day and was positively correlated with the availability of sugar. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

We used two experimental paradigms inspired by developmental biology to study how bees obtain information on changing colony needs that results in precocious foraging. An analog of ""cell culture,"" with bees reared outside of colonies in different sized groups, revealed that worker-worker interactions exert quantitative effects on endocrine and behavioral development.

Birds visited inflorescences in the early, mid and late flowering seasons. In contrast, honeybees visited only on days in the late flowering period when maximum temperatures exceeded 15°C. Self pollen remained on pollen presenters of flowers for up to 5 days in the early and mid periods. In the late period, when honeybees visited inflorescences, self pollen was removed within 2 days. Pollen removal was similar for caged (birds excluded) and open inflorescences in the late period, indicating that most pollen was removed by honeybees. In the early and mid periods, honeyeaters pollinated 22% and 27% of flowers on open inflorescences, respectively. In the late period, when both birds and bees visited inflorescences, 64–73% of flowers on open inflorescences were pollinated. Foraging by honeybees resulted in pollen deposition as 38% of flowers on caged inflorescences were pollinated. Throughout the flowering season a similar number of pollen grains was deposited per stigma. There were 3.0–3.7 pollen grains per stigma on open inflorescences in the late period, although only 2.0 grains per stigma on caged inflorescences. In the early and mid periods, fewer caged than open inflorescences produced fruits, indicating the importance of honeyeaters to reproductive success at these times. In contrast, in the late period when honeybees visited inflorescences, fruit‐set was similar on caged and open inflorescences.

E. plantagineum is self-compatible, so that germination and pollen tube growth of both cross- and self-pollen to the ovules at the style base occur. The technique utilized ‘virgin’ flowers, bagged as buds and which subsequently opened within the bags. After careful unbagging, the majority (93.5%) of initial visitors to these previously-unvisited flowers were honey bees (Apis mellifera). The technique demonstrated that although autogamy was possible, it was not predominant in E. plantagineum because permanently-bagged flowers had very low numbers of pollen tubes at their style bases (usually none), and emasculated and intact flowers exposed to single honey bee visits usually had the same numbers of tubes. Within treatments (intact, emasculated), honey bee visits for pollen, nectar or both, did not result in differences in pollen tube number, nor was there any connection between degree of pollination and time spent by a single honey bee per virgin flower. Although most honey bees attending virgin flowers carried pellets of E. plantagineum pollen on their hind legs, as a result of grooming actions to gather grains from their bodies, they were still as effective as pollinating agents as bees lacking corbicular pollen. Because one-third of single honey bee visits to emasculated virgin flowers (bearing receptive stigmas) introduced sufficient pollen to achieve fertilization of all four ovules, and almost two-thirds of such visits resulted in pollination, it appears that honey bees were effective cross-pollinators of E. plantagineum. Various advantages of the technique, including applications to agriculture, are discussed. © 1992 International Bee Research Association.","Aniline blue; Apis mellifera; Callose; Echium plantagineum; Fluorescence microscopy; Foraging; Honey bees; Pollen tubes; Pollination; Pollinators; Staining",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-21144475146

Diflubenzuron seldom persists for more than a few days in soil and water. Applied to foliage of terrestrial plants, it tends to remain adsorbed for several weeks with little or no absorption or translocation from plant surfaces; loss occurs mainly from wind abrasion, rain washing, or shedding of senescent leaves. Among terrestrial insects, there is great variability in sensitivity to diflubenzuron. Sensitive pestiferous species of insects die at topical applications of 0.003-0.034 μg per larave or after consuming diets containing 0.1 mg/kg. Some beneficial insects, such as honey bee Apis mellifera, are adversely affected at 1 mg/kg fresh weight (FW) of diet. Diflubenzuron application rates between 28-56 g/ha or 2.5-16 μg/L are highly effective against pestiferous aquatic dipterans, including representative chaoborids, chironomids, and culicids. These same dosages temporarily suppress nontarget populations of cladocerans, copepods, mayfly nymphs, corixids, and springtails; population recovery is usually complete within 80 days. In general, crustaceans were the most sensitive nontarget aquatic organisms tested. Adverse effects on crustacean growth, survival, reproduction, and behavior occur between 0.062-2 μg/L. Birds seem comparatively resistant to diflubenzuron: acute oral LD50 doses exceed 2000 mg/kg body weight (BW); dietary concentrations <4640 mg/kg FW are tolerated for at least 8 days; and forest birds seem unharmed by recommended diflubenzuron application procedures to control pestiferous insects.

The behaviour of queen and worker honeybees (Apis melliferaL.) was observed using small colonies in observation hives. Workers paid more attention to queens which had been mated for 2 months or more than to those which were newly mated; virgin queens received least attention. Queens received most attention when they were stationary and least when they were walking over the comb; virgin queens were most active. Queen cells had as many attendants as virgin queens and queen larvae were inspected almost continuously. The queen pheromone component 9–oxo‐trans‐2–decenoic acid stimulated ‘court’ behaviour when presented on small polyethylene blocks, but workers responded aggressively to complete extracts of queens' heads. Both the heads and abdomens of mated queens received much attention from court workers but the abdomens were palpated by more workers for longer and were licked much more. The queens' thoraces were least attended. Abdominal tergites posterior to tergite glands were licked for longer than those anterior to the glands. Only worker bees very near to the queen reacted to her and joined her ‘court’. No evidence was found of a diel periodicity in the behaviour of a queen or her ‘court’. During the winter the queen's court was smaller than in summer and she walked less and laid fewer eggs. When colonies were fed with sucrose syrup in winter, their queens laid more eggs and workers reared more brood but there was no change in the attention received by the queens. The implications of these findings for the secretion and distribution of queen pheromones are discussed. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

In each muscle there are additional subunits in the core, closely related to the subunits in the wall. Evaluation of serial sections through fleshfly filaments suggests that the relationship of the three subunits observed in the core to those in the wall varies along the length of the filaments. In waterbug filaments there are three dense and three less dense subunits for a total of six all closely related to the wall. Bee filaments have three subunits related to the wall and three subunits located eccentrically in the core of the filaments. The presence of core subunits can be related to the paramyosin content of the filaments. © 1992, The Biophysical Society. All rights reserved.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026723815

All colonies had been previously requeened with marked European queens. Heritage of new queens (European daughter replacements versus Africanized usurpers) was traced by mitochondrial DNA and morphological characteristics of worker progeny. Three usurpations (5% of colony fates, at a rate of 4.7% of colonies per year) occurred. These colonies showed congruent African-derived mitochondrial DNA and Africanized morphology. Supersedures accounted for much of the introgression of African genes into the test apiaries. Twenty-eight colonies (48%) superseded their queens once, three (5%) had two supersedures and one (2%) had three supersedures. All original and supersedure queens had European mtDNA. The worker progeny of original queens had European morphology, but the progeny of supersedure queens showed mixed morphology, with mostly intermediate and European morphology in first generation workers and intermediate and Africanized morphology in later generations. Sixteen (28%) of the European queens died without being successfully replaced by their colonies, and only seven (12%) survived the 15-month test. Hives left unoccupied after colony failure would have been available for colonization by Africanized swarms. Usurpations, supersedures and colony failures thus accounted for an annual Africanization rate (i.e. a decrease in the percentage of colonies with both European mitochondrial DNA and European morphology) of 53%. © 1992 International Bee Research Association.","Africanized honey bees; Apis mellifera; Colony failure; European honey bees; Genetic change; Honey bee colonies; Mitochondrial DNA; Morphology; Neotropical region; Supersedure; Usurpation; Venezuela",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-21144459681

We studied the role of trophallactic interactions in the distribution of coumaphos, the active ingredient, among the colony members and whether coumaphos can reach all mites by systemic activity. Colonies were divided into three compartments by a screen, one receiving a Perizin treatment by sprinkling, the others receiving no Perizin. In this way it was possible to trace the amount of coumaphos transferred between bees through the screen from the treated part to the untreated one by trophallaxis. After different periods of time the number of fallen mites was counted and the amount of coumaphos in bees was determined for all hive compartments. We found that trophallactic interactions are of minor importance in the distribution of Perizin between the two compartments. The recommended method of sprinkling Perizin over the bees was shown to be very inefficient; only 24% of the applied amount reaches the alimentary canal of the bees; the rest must therefore remain at other places: on the outside of the bees, in the combs and on the hive‐parts. 1992 The Netherlands Entomological Society","Apis mellifera; Perizin; trophallaxis; Varroa jacobsoni",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027041252

The communities of pollinating insects in reclaimed field margins were compared with those of a margin with a naturally diverse flora and an adjacent pasture. A beehive was placed in the area and the collection of pollen by the honey-bees was followed over the season in order to compare the bees' preferences with the supply of flowering plants available in the different experimental field margins. The sown leguminous plants were very attractive to most insect groups, especially bees and bumble-bees, and their pollen constituted an important part of the bees' total catch.

Honey bees, visiting artificial flower patches, were used as a model system to study the effects of sugar type (sucrose, glucose, fructose, and mixed monosaccharide), caloric reward, and floral colour on nectarivore foraging behaviour. Observed behaviour was compared to the predictions of various (sometimes contradictory) foraging models. Bees drank indiscriminately from flowers in patches with a blue‐white flower dimorphism when caloric values of rewards were equal (e.g. 1M sucrose in both colours; 1 M sucrose versus 2 M monosaccharide of either type), but when nectar caloric rewards were unequal, they switched to the flower colour with the calorically greater reward. In yellow‐blue dimorphic flower patches, on the other hand, bees did not maximize caloric reward. Rather, bees were individually constant, some to blue, others to yellow, regardless of the sugar types or energy content of the rewards provided in the two flower morphs. The results suggest that optimal foraging theory (maximization of net caloric gain per unit time) is a robust predictor of behaviour with regard to the sugar types common to nectars; such optimal foraging is, however, limited by a superstructure of individual constancy.

When compared with A. cerana, a native bee to Asia, Apis mellifera has a much lower capacity to remove V. jacobsoni. Phoresy and continuous parasitism on adult bees allow dispersal of V. jacobsoni worldwide on A. mellifera. The observed frequent cleaning of the wing base, petiole, and dorsum of abdomen indicates that grooming behavior is partly responsible for the high numbers of mites found in debris collections of honeybee colonies.

Since the various optical specializations in the drone eye have now been recognized, they can be traced in the eyes of other species: thus, the drone eye serves as a model to give a better understanding of the relationship between structure and function of compound eyes in particular, but also of visual systems in general. © 1992.",,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026538324

Measurements of JH titers support the hypothesis that plasticity in honey bee behavioral development is a consequence of modulation of JH by extrinsic factors. Observations of individually marked bees in a colony composed of two phenotypically distinguishable subfamilies revealed that the likelihood of undergoing behavioral reversion was influenced by worker age but not by worker genotype. The effect of worker age on reversion is consistent with a previously formulated model for the regulation of age polyethism in honey bees that predicts that workers of different ages have different response thresholds for task‐associated stimuli.

Examination by electron microscopy of the sting apparatuses of several vespid species and that of Apis mellifera L., the honey bee, revealed previously unreported structural variations between apid and vespid aculei which likely contribute to differences in sting autotomy rates observed between the honey bee and the social wasps.

Rev. A 43, 1039 (1991)] concludes that weak extremely-low-frequency (ELF) electromagnetic fields cannot affect biology on the cell level. However, Adair's assertion that few cells of higher organisms contain magnetite (Fe3O4) and his blanket denial of reproducible ELF effects on animals are both wrong. Large numbers of single-domain magnetite particles are present in a variety of animal tissues, including up to a hundred million per gram in human brain tissues, organized in clusters of tens to hundreds of thousand per gram. This is far more than a ''few cells.'' Similarly, a series of reproducible behavioral experiments on honeybees, Apis mellifera, have shown that they are capable of responding to weak ELF magnetic fields that are well within the bounds of Adair's criteria. A biologically plausible model of the interaction of single-domain magnetosomes with a mechanically activated transmembrane ion channel shows that ELF fields on the order of 0.1 to 1 mT are capable of perturbing the open-closed state by an energy of kT. As up to several hundred thousand such structures could fit within a eukaryotic cell, and the noise should go as the square root of the number of independent channels, much smaller ELF sensitivities at the cellular level are possible. Hence, the credibility of weak ELF magnetic effects on living systems must stand or fall mainly on the merits and reproducibility of the biological or epidemiological experiments that suggest them, rather than on dogma about physical implausibility. © 1992 The American Physical Society.",,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-35949006011

This major biotin‐containing protein was shown to be present in several tissues of 10 different species of insects by doing a western blot and staining it with streptavidin‐linked peroxidase. The amount of this protein in the thorax of the mosquito, Aedes aegypti, increased during development. The non‐flying grasshopper, Barytettix psolus, had reduced amounts of this protein in their thoraces compared to a flying grass‐hopper, Schistocerca americana. The major biotin‐containing protein was purified from the thoraces of honeybee, Apis mellifera, using an avidin Sepharose affinity column. The purified biotin‐containing protein was shown to be pyruvate carboxylase, an enzyme that catalyzes the specific transfer of a carboxyl group to pyruvate, yielding oxaloacetate. The purified honeybee pyruvate carboxylase was characterized enzymatically and structurally. This protein had a single subunit of Mr 128 k and formed a native molecule of about Mr 500 k consisting of four of these subunits. The amino acid composition of the protein was also obtained. The enzymatic activity of this protein required acetyl‐CoA, ATP, and Mg2+. The Kms of the enzyme for bicarbonate and pyruvate were similar to pyruvate carboxylase from other oganisms. The biotin‐containing protein was also partially purified from mosquito thoraces using the same methods and was shown to be pyruvate carboxylase. The comparison between insect pyruvate carboxylase and that of other organisms is provided and the possible physiological role of the pyruvate carboxylase in the thoracic muscles of insects is discussed.

Melittin converts from a monomeric random coil to an α‐helical tetramer as the pH is raised from 4.0 to 9.5, as ionic strength is increased, as temperature is raised or lowered from about 37 °C, or as phosphate is added. The thermodynamics of this tetramerization (termed “folding”) are explored using circular dichroism. The melittin tetramer has two pKa values of 7.5 and 8.5 corresponding to protonation of the N‐terminus and Lys 23, respectively. pKa values calculated with the program DelPhi (Gilson, M.K., Sharp, K.A., &amp; Honig, B.H., 1987, J. Comp. Chem. 9, 327–335; Gilson, M.K. &amp; Honig, B.H., 1988a, Proteins3, 32–52; Gilson, M.K. &amp; Honig, B.H., 1988b, Proteins 4, 7–18) agree with experimental titration data. Greater electrostatic repulsion of these protonated groups destabilizes the tetramer by 3.6 kcal/mol at pH 4.0 compared to pH 9.5. Increasing the concentration of NaCl in the solution from 0 to 0.5 M stabilizes the tetramer by 5–6 kcal/mol at pH 4.0. The effect of NaCl is modeled with a ligand‐binding approach. The melittin tetramer is found to have a temperature of maximum stability ranging from 35.5 to 43 °C depending on the pH, unfolding above and below that temperature. ΔCp 0 for folding ranges from –0.085 to –0.102 cal g−1 K−1 comparable to that of other small globular proteins (Privalov, P.L., 1979, Adv. Protein Chem. 33, 167–241). ΔH0 and ΔS0 are found to decrease with temperature, presumably due to the hydrophobic effect (Kauzmann, W., 1959, Adv. Protein Chem. 14, 1–63). Phosphate is found to perturb the equilibrium substantially with a maximal effect at 150 mM, stabilizing the tetramer at pH 7.4 and 25 °C by 4.6 kcal/mol. The enthalpy change due to addition of phosphate (–7.5 kcal/mol at 25 °C) can be accounted for by simple dielectric screening. Both circular dichroism and crystallographic results suggest that phosphate may bind Lys 23 at the ends of the elongated tetramer. These detailed measurements give insight into the relative importance of various forces for the stability of melittin in the folded form and may provide an experimental standard for future tests of computational energetics on this simple protein system.

In this tissue [3H]2-deoxyglucose ([3H]2DG) in the dark and during repetitive light stimulation is phosphorylated to [3H]2-deoxyglucose-6P ([3H]2DG-6P) almost exclusively in the glial cells. Hence, stimulus-induced changes in the rate of formation of [3H]2DG-6P occurs predominantly in the glial cells. Repetitive stimulation of the photoreceptors with light flashes induced about a 47% rise in the rate of formation of [3H]2DG-6P in the glial cells and this effect is probably due to the activation of hexokinase. The potent inhibitor of glycolysis iodoacetic acid (IAA), inhibited this phosphorylation by about 75%. Probably this was largely due to an about 70% decrease of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Exposure of the retina to IAA suppressed the transient rise in oxygen consumption (ΔQO2) in the photoreceptors and subsequently the light-induced receptor potential. This indicates that the supply of a glycolytic substrate by glial cells to the photoreceptors is greatly reduced by IAA. Anoxia, by rapidly suppressing QO2, abolished the receptor potential of the photoreceptors and caused a rapid drop of about 50% in the ATP content of the retina. At the same time formation of [3H]2DG-6P was inhibited by about 30%. This indicates that respiring photoreceptors send a metabolic signal to glial cells which is suppressed by anoxia. © 1991.","Adenosine triphosphate; Anoxia; Drone retina; Glial cell; Glycolysis; Iodoacetic acid; Photoreceptor; Photostimulation; [3H]2-Deoxyglucose",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025791920

The process of differentiation into laying and non-laying workers is accompanied by a great deal of aggression within the colony. In this study, I tried to establish the relationship between the potential to become egg-layers and behavioural differences at the individual level. To eight observation hives, I introduced 200 individually marked workers of similar age and observed their behavioural differentiation during a queenless period. Shortly after the first egg-laying worker appeared, the marked workers were dissected in order to determine their level of ovarian activation. The future laying-workers seemed to be slightly more involved in the rearing of new queens than other workers. As reported by other authors, aggression was mostly directed towards workers with activated ovaries. Only a very small number of aggressive workers were aggressive; on an average, slightly fewer of these marked workers had activated ovaries. Aggression resulted in physical damage in only a small number of cases. The possible disadvantage of aggression for the bees under attack is discussed, as well as the possible benefit for the aggressors. Evidence is presented that the most detrimental effect of aggression for bees under attack is the fact that they lose considerable quantities of food through trophallaxis to other workers. Workers with activated ovaries withdrew inside empty cells significantly more often than other workers, possibly to avoid attacks. Aggressive workers were (almost) never seen to receive food from the bees they attacked. It is suggested that by preventing other workers from becoming egg-layers, aggressors increase their own chances of future reproduction. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026365598

In this study we quantitatively elucidated the production, secretion, and transmission of 9-keto2(E)-decenoic acid (9-ODA), one of the components of the mandibular gland pheromone of the honey bee queen Apis mellifera; this is the only identified primer pheromone complex in the eusocial insects. Mated queens produce 12-400 μg of 9-ODA/day, or between 10% and 170% the average amount found in the glands at any one time. Approximately 0.5 μg of 9-ODA is maintained on the body surface of queens by an equilibrium between exudation, internalization, tracking on the comb, and removal by workers. Retinue bees, attending the queen, remove the greatest amount, although the role of the wax as both a sink and a medium for pheromone transfer has been previously underestimated. Only about 1 in 10 retinue workers pick up substantial quantities of pheromone while attending the queen and, within seconds, most of the acquired 9-ODA is found externally on the abdomen, or in the gut. These attendants, also called messenger bees, transfer 9-ODA to other workers, mostly through direct contacts, but also via the wax. A model evaluating the pathways and relative quantities of 9-ODA transferred throughout the nest is presented. As well as being important for a basic understanding of the system, the results have implications for the proper design and use of pheromones in bee management. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002775705

Heartbeat patterns from these latter two groups were compared with the baseline data from the former three groups. Results showed that normal modulatory patterns occurring during feeding and locomotion persisted when the neurohormonal pathway was disrupted, but the same modulation was absent when the neural pathway was disrupted.

In addition, the length of this sequence varies between and within subspecies. Four length categories (200, 250, 450 and 650 bp) have been found in 63 sampled colonies. Analysis of the sequence of the largest type reveals the existence of two units: P (54 bp, 100% A + T) and Q (196 bp, 93.4% A + T). The lengths encountered in the sample are explained by the following combinations: Q, PQ, PQQ and PQQQ. According to similarities in primary and secondary structures, the sequence Q has been divided into three parts: Q1 (similar to the 3' end of the COI gene), Q2 (similar to the neighboring tRNA(leu) gene) and Q3 (highly similar to the P sequence). These relationships led us to hypothesize that these sequences, which do not have any counterpart in Drosophila yakuba mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), arose by tandem duplication. The usual location of length variation in mtDNA control regions prompted us to examine the hypothesis that this COI-COII intergenic region might contain an origin of replication.

Two colony siz.es were used: small, congested colonies and large, uncongested colonies. Both groups of colonies were treated with various dosages of the five-component, synthetic queen mandibular pheromone in the spring, and the extent and timing of swarming were followed. Most treatment groups received pheromone or a solvent blank (control) on a stationary slide; one group of the congested colonies received a pheromone treatment via an aerosol spray. The pheromone was not effective at delaying swarming in the congested colonies at any dosage applied on slides, but the aerosol spray-treated colonies swarmed significantly later in the season than the control colonies. The uncongested, pheromone-treated colonies exhibited a dose-dependent delay in swarming, with the highest dosage colonies swarming almost four weeks later than the control colonies. These results indicate an interaction between congestion and pheromone in the control of honey bee reproduction. While congestion may in itself be a factor stimulating swarming, these results are consistent with the interpretation that colony congestion reduces the transmission of queen pheromone within the nest, thereby removing the queen 's pheromone-based inhibition of queen rearing and subsequent swarming by workers. © 1991 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","honey bee; pheromone; queen; swarming",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000715798

The epithelia in both species differ considerably in shape and in the organization of the cytoskeleton. During previtellogenic stages, the epithelium consists of columnar-shaped cells with small (Dysdercus) or no (Apis) lateral intercellular spaces. During vitellogenesis, the follicle cells round up; the intercellular spaces increase in size in Dysdercus follicles, whereas in Apis follicles they remain small. Along the basal surface of the follicle cells, there are conspicuous parallel bundles of microfilaments perpendicular to the anteroposterior axis of the follicles. In the honeybee, these microfilament bundles are present in long filopodia, most of which are embedded in thickenings of the basement membrane and extend over the surfaces of neighbouring cells. In the cotton bug, the basal surface of the follicle cells is thrown into parallel folds. The microfilament bundles are located just underneath the cell membrane where the folds contact the basement membrane. In the polar regions of the Dysdercus follicle, the epithelial cells become flat and adhere to each other without forming intercellular spaces.

Discriminant functions exist that allow determination of subspecies similarity on the basis of these measurements. Here we compute the heritabilities of the standard character set for ten eco-types (Table 1) of bees. Heritability is extremely high for body size characters and there is greater genetic variance among ecotypes than within. Heritability is lower, but still very high, for the vein angle characters and hamuli number (Table 3). Heritability was also computed for the same character set for a group of 20 colonies in Venezuela (Table 4). Heritabilities declined by an average of 41% when specimens were reared in nonmaternal environments, but were still extremely high for the body size characters. These results support the continued use of morphological characters as a tool for identifying Africanized bees.

Analysis of these differences using parthenogenetic offspring groups permitted the estimation of genotypic values and revealed a high degree of genetic variability that is evident among related as well as unrelated bees. The results obtained from related groups are of particular importance, since they demonstrated the existence of strong genetic variability among individuals of the same colony. Quantitative analysis yielded high estimates of additive genetic effects and low estimates of dominance effects. Selection of individual workers resulted in an explicit increase in genetic variance of the next generation (G1). However, selection of bees from the parthenogenetic G1 generation, which was done to obtain parthenogenetic G2 offspring, did not lead to further improvement in selection. This observation suggests that recombination of linked genes underlying proboscis extension reflex was neglible during selection in parthenogenetic groups. Taken together with further behavioral analysis (Brandes and Menzel, 1990; Brandes et al., 1988), results from these quantitative genetic experiments suggest that additive genetic factors contribute significantly to variability among individuals for associative learning. © 1991 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","Apis mellifera; genetics; honeybees; learning; selection",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025893027

To do this, we cross-fostered honey bees between colonies with high-defensive responses and colonies with low-defensive responses in alarm pheromone tests. Individuals from high-defensive colonies were more likely to guard in their own colonies (controls) than cross-fostered bees from low-defensive colonies. Cross-fostered high-defensive bees also were more likely to guard in low-defense colonies.

It will selectively exploit the most profitable source in an array and will rapidly shift its foraging efforts following changes in the array. How does this colony-level ability emerge from the behavior of individual bees? The answer lies in understanding how bees modulate their colony's rates of recruitment and abandonment for nectar sources in accordance with the profitability of each source. A forager modulates its behavior in relation to nectar source profitability: as profitability increases, the tempo of foraging increases, the intensity of dancing increases, and the probability of abandoning the source decreases. How does a forager assess the profitability of its nectar source? Bees accomplish this without making comparisons among nectar sources. Neither do the foragers compare different nectar sources to determine the relative profitability of any one source, nor do the food storers compare different nectar loads and indicate the relative profitability of each load to the foragers. Instead, each forager knows only about its particular nectar source and independently calculates the absolute profitability of its source. Even though each of a colony's foragers operates with extremely limited information about the colony's food sources, together they will generate a coherent colonylevel response to different food sources in which better ones are heavily exploited and poorer ones are abandoned. This is shown by a computer simulation of nectar-source selection by a colony in which foragers behave as described above. Nectar-source selection by honey bee colonies is a process of natural selection among alternative nectar sources as foragers from more profitable sources ""survive"" (continue visiting their source) longer and ""reproduce"" (recruit other foragers) better than do foragers from less profitable sources. Hence this colonial decision-making is based on decentralized control. We suggest that honey bee colonies possess decentralized decision-making because it combines effectiveness with simplicity of communication and computation within a colony. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025953263

Relationships between these parameters and effects of thoracic temperature on power input and temperature elevation were studied. Oxygen consumption increased above basal levels only when flight muscles became active. Increasing muscle potential frequencies correlated with elevated oxygen consumption and raised thoracic temperature. The difference between thoracic and ambient temperature and oxygen consumption were linearly related. Oxygen consumption per muscle potential (μl O2 · g-1thorax· MP-1) was two-fold higher in drones than in workers. However, oxygen consumption for heating the thorax (μl O2 · g-1thorax· (Tth-Ta) · °C-1) was nearly the same in workers and drones. Thoracic temperature affected the amount of oxygen consumed per muscle potential (R10=1.5). Achieved temperature elevation per 100 MP was more temperature sensitive in drones (R10=6-10) than in workers (R10=3.6). Q10 values for oxygen consumption were 3 in workers and 4.5-6 in drones. Muscle potential frequency decreased with a Q10=1.8 in workers and 2.7 in drones. Heating behaviour of workers and drones was different. Drones generated heat less continuously than workers, and showed greater interindividual variability in predilection to heat.

When presented with a choice of cuticular extracts from 5-day-old and <1-day-old adult bees, mites showed a significant preference for the young-bee extract in three of four bee colony sources. This discrimination was due apparently to a greater positive response elicited by the young-bee extract rather than a deterrent effect of old-bee extract, as the extract of old bees evoked a significantly higher response than a hexane control. A bioassay of silica-gel fractions of young-bee extract indicated that cuticular hydrocarbons alone were responsible for tracheal mite response. Further fractionation of a hydrocarbon fraction by argentation chromatography demonstrated that both saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons were involved in the mite response, but when presented in opposition, mites showed a stronger response to the saturated than to the unsaturated components. Mites placed in zones treated with cuticular extract of young bees exhibited higher angular velocities than those placed on hexane, causing them to remain in the extract-treated zones for extended periods. These results point to a possible control strategy whereby migration of tracheal mites to young-bee hosts could be disrupted by artificially altering the chemical profile of the honeybee cuticle. © 1991 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","Acarapis woodi; Apidae; Apis mellifera; cuticular lipids; honeybee; host selection; hydrocarbons; Hymenoptera; kairomones; Tarsonemidae; tracheal mite",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001584282

The terminal arborizations of the lobula neurons are in juxtaposition with the dendritic branches of the DNs (Figs. 2, 3b, 5). Both of the DNs descend into the ipsilateral side of the thoracic ganglia via the dorsal intermediate tract (Fig. 6) and send out many blebbed terminal branches into the surrounding motor neuropil (Figs. 3c, 7). 2. Both the lobula and descending neurons respond in a directionally selective manner to the motion of widefield, periodic square-wave gratings. 3. The neurons have broad directional tuning curves (Figs. 10, 11). HR1 is maximally sensitive to regressive (back-to-front) motion and HP1 is maximally sensitive to progressive (front-to-back) motion over the ipsilateral eye (Fig. 11). DNVII1 is maximally sensitive when there is simultaneous regressive motion over the ipsilateral eye and progressive motion over the contralateral eye (Fig. 12a). Conversely, DNIV1 is optimally stimulated when there is simultaneous progressive motion over the ipsilateral eye and regressive motion over the contralateral eye (Fig. 12b). 4. The response of DNIV1 is shown to depend on the contrast frequency (CF) rather than the angular velocity of the periodic gratings used as stimuli. The peak responses of both regressive and progressive sensitive DNs are shown to occur at CFs of 8-10 Hz (Figs. 13, 14). © 1991 Springer-Verlag.","Contrast frequency; Descending neurons; Directional selectivity; Insect vision; Lobula neurons; Motion sensitivity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026015922

The extent of drone drifting was measured by counting marked drones in each colony. Most drones began drifting when 6–7 days old. The proportion of drones that drifted increased with age to a level of 50% at 15 days old. The proportion of drones older than 15 days that had drifted from the parent colony remained fairly constant (50–60%). Twenty one percent of the drones drifted more than once. Drones continued drifting after they had left their parent colonies, with the level of drift being fairly constant in all age groups of drones. At distances greater than 50 m, drone drift decreased with increased spacing between colonies. No drones drifted between colonies that were spaced more than 150 m apart unless other colonies were present at intermediate distances. Drone drift between hives with coloured entrances, offset entrances or laid out in horseshoe formations did not differ significantly from colonies arranged in straight rows. Drift between hives in a pair was significantly lower than that within rows of five hives, when drones were 7–10 and 14–16 days old. Drift from colonies at the ends of rows was not significantly different from drift from colonies in the middle of rows. There was no apparent tendency for drifting drones to collect in the colonies at both ends of a row.

(1) Each mandibular gland of the worker honeybee, Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae), consists of an axial cavity lined with a thin cuticular intima elaborated by a flat epithelium, and of numerous glandular units (type 3), each with a duct cell and a large polyploid glandular cell. Mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum are preponderant organelles. The Golgi apparatus is reduced; its activity is lysosomal. With increasing age, the size of the gland and the amount of 2-heptanone per headspace sample progressively increased. The increasing quantity of 2-heptanone from 0.1 μl at emergence to 7 μl in foraging bees, is strictly correlated with hypertrophy of the mitochondria, which are engaged in the production of heterogeneous bodies. 2. (2) Similar age-dependent changes of 2-heptanone levels were found in mandibular glands of workers from docile and aggressive colonies and the amount of 2-heptanone in foraging bees of the two groups was alike. Neither crushed glands nor 2-heptanone showed any direct effect as an alarm pheromone on guardian bees at hive entrances. 2-heptanone had either an attractive or a repulsive effect on guards, according to the season; it showed a repulsive effect when added to sucrose solution which was visited by foragers. 2-heptanone had a temporary, repulsive effect on the visitation of flowers by foraging bees, hence it seems to act as a ""forage-marking"" pheromone. 2-heptanone does not inhibit the germination of pollen grains. © 1991.","2-heptanone; alarm pheromone; Apis mellifera; GLC; honeybee workers; mandibular glands; ontogeny; TEM and SEM",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001431439

Foragers were able to detect differences in concentration of as little as 5%. Twenty percent molasses was found to repel inexperienced foragers strongly; however, they could be trained to accept higher concentrations.

Worker behavior is characterized by two elements: the proportion of time spent performing specific tasks (task specialization) and the temporal pattern of task performance (temporal division of labor).

In contrast, ecdysteroid titres were undetectably low in both nurses and foragers, higher in laying workers, and higher still in laying queens. Measurements of juvenile hormone titres are consistent with previous findings demonstrating that this hormone regulates worker age polyethism but does not play a typical role in reproduction.

Bees trained to the aluminium signal showed a preference for violet followed by blue and finally by yellow. These results are interpreted using a model which allows a determination of the bee's perceptual distances between the stimuli used. The rank order obtained in colour-choice experiments can be related to generalization processes in which bees trained to the aluminium signal preferred the colour signal which is perceptually closest to the pretrained signal, even if innate colour preferences could not be discarded. Since bees generalize effectively from one visual cue to the other, it is to be expected that any pretraining would have a strong impact on the colour choice even if no obvious colour marks or ""neutral"" marks (aluminium discs) are used. © 1991.","colour preferences; Colour vision; generalization process; honeybee",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0006974123

The different modalities evoke specific antennal responses in this insect. Three different fluorescent dyes were applied successively in the same preparation in order to visualise the various fiber projections from the antennae and the lobula in the brain of the honeybee. Three neuropile areas where sensory fibers of the antennae overlap with visual projection neurons from the lobula were found. Within the posterior‐median protocerebrum the antennal tract T6‐1 comes in close vicinity to the lobula tract Lo T‐9 and to some other lobula fibers that cannot be assigned to a special tract. Antennal T6‐3 fibers overlap with lobula LoT‐7 neurons within the posterior protocerebrum more laterally. Antennal T5 fibers arborise in the dorsal lobe and show common projection sites with lobula LoT‐3 neurons.

Subjects were conditioned to discriminate between two odors, one associated with sucrose feeding and the other associated with a 10 V AC shock if they responded to the sucrose unconditioned stimulus (US) in the context of that odor. Most Ss readily learned to respond to the odor followed by sucrose feeding and not to the odor associated with sucrose stimulation plus shock. Furthermore, in the context of the odor associated with shock, significantly more subjects withheld or delayed proboscis extension on stimulation with the sucrose US than they did in the context of the odor associated with feeding. Thus, restrained honeybees can readily learn to avoid shock according to an odor context by withholding proboscis extension to a normally powerful releaser.

Workers in the 2 species intermediate in body size, A. cerana and A. mellifera, appear to be high-powered relative to those of the largest species (A. dorsata) and the smallest species (A. florea). Among the Asian species, A. cerana's colonies also show a disproportionately high mass-specific metabolic rate, and their foragers make many more trips per day in the same habitat than do foragers of the other species. These various traits seem to be functionally related, and to represent evolved differences among species in worker ""tempo', ie in the rate of performance of colony tasks. The low-tempo species (Apis florea, A. dorsata) nest in the open, protecting the comb and its contents with a thick curtain of young worker bees. The high-tempo species build their nests in enclosed cavities, which allows the workers to protect and provision a relatively larger area of comb. Worker life-span is longer in the open-nesting species; this allows colonies to maintain the work force needed for the curtain, even though the rate of worker production (per capita) is lower than that of cavity nesters because of the relatively small number of brood cells available. A benefit of higher tempo (enhanced ability to provision brood) is better realized owing to the greater brood-rearing capacity of their nests. A cost of higher tempo (shorter life-span, resulting in fewer workers available for nest protection) is less important for the cavity nesters because the cavity walls reduce the need for protection by workers. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026080249

A Y-choice situation was used to determine the frequency range and amplitude thresholds of hearing in bees. In addition, spontaneous reactions of bees to airborne sound were observed and used to determine thresholds of hearing. Both methods revealed that bees are able to detect sound frequencies up to about 500 Hz. The hearing threshold is 100-300 mm/s peak-to-peak velocity and is roughly constant over the range of detectable frequencies. The amplitude of the signals emitted in the dance language is 5 to 10 times higher, so we can conclude that bees can easily detect the dance sounds. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Auditory sense; Dance language; Learning; Near field sound",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026011332

Visits of small native bees significantly increased paternal success while those of honey bees Apis mellifera reduced male fitness. Only visits by large native bees had discernible effects on recipient fecundity and, overall, fecundity was not limited by visitation. Maternal plants bearing large-petalled flowers produced fewer flowers during the experiment, reducing their total seed production.

The high cost of maintaining the population throughout winter is balanced by the benefits of organized colonial existence, the benefits increasing with decreasing ambient temperature. Cost and benefit curves intersect at 15°C: below this air temperature it is metabolically cheaper for bees to exist in tight thermoregulating superorganismal groups.

Signaling may evolve when both queens and males benefit from avoiding matched matings, such as in the fire ant Solenopsis invicta. Intercolonial recognition is the most plausible means by which recognition itself can generate genetic odor-cue diversity, but in species such as the honey bee Apis mellifera in which intercolonial recognition appears primarily environmental, the effect may be small. This leads to the possibility that the weak full-sister versus half-sister discrimination shown by honey bees is partly due to a low diversity of odor cues.

However, the physiological basis of juvenile hormone titre regulation was unknown. Using a radiochemical assay for juvenile hormone biosynthesis in vitro, we demonstrate that differences in juvenile hormone titres among bees performing different age-dependent tasks are a consequence of changes in rates of hormone synthesis by the corpora allata. Rates of juvenile hormone biosynthesis were low in newly emerged bees, 7-9-day-old nurse bees, and 14-15-day-old bees collected from the nest periphery, and high in foragers. Rates of biosynthesis were highly correlated with haemolymph titres of juvenile hormone measured in the same individuals. Corpora allata contained mostly methyl farnesoate, the immediate precursor of juvenile hormone, and released principally juvenile hormone III into the incubation medium, indicating no appreciable hormone storage. We also report similarities and differences in parameters of juvenile hormone biosynthesis between nurse bees and foragers that were found during the course of a detailed characterization of the radiochemical assay for adult worker honey bees. These results, coupled with the fact that it is possible to measure rates of juvenile hormone biosynthesis from individual bees, indicate that the radiochemical assay will be useful in further studies of hormonal regulation of bee behaviour. © 1991.","Apis mellifera; corpora allata; division of labour; honey bee; juvenile hormone; social insects",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026395420

During the first two passages, multiplication of the organisms was observed at very high titres in suckling mouse brain (107 to 1011 CCU/ml) generally without the appearance of antibody, thus mimicking the so-called ""immunological tolerance"" phenomenon. Intracerebral multiplication of A56 decreased during the third passage (102 to 104 CCU/ml) and ceased during the fourth passage. Spiroplasma multiplication in brain was apparently well tolerated, since brain lesions were minimal and clinical symptoms were limited to a clear, but only rarely significant, delay in growth curves of inoculated versus non-inoculated mice. Progressive spongiform encephalopathy was never observed. Strain A56 S. melliferum appears as the second spiroplasma, after the tick-derived Spiroplasma mirum capable of multiplying in both invertebrate and vertebrate hosts. © 1991.","Animal model, Tolerance, Mouse; Spiroplasma melliferum, Spiroplasma mirum, Encephalopathy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025923482

Queens were allowed to mate before and after experimental manipulations of the local drone population. After the first series of queen matings, aerial drone traps were used to capture and eliminate 6 398 drones. Then, approximately 6 400 drones of known colour (yellow) from managed European colonies were introduced into the area via drone source colonies, and a second series of queen matings was done. The drones caught in aerial traps were colour sorted. Essentially, 80% of the drones during the first mating period were black (MDH allelic frequencies typical of feral Africanized bees). During the second mating period, the percentage of black drones was much lower, averaging 53%. The drone population manipulations resulted in a significant increase (from 47.4% before to 93.6% after) in the proportion of worker progeny having more than one-and-a-half yellow abdominal bands. Thus, drone elimination followed by drone flooding can greatly increase the rate of desirable matings in an AHB-dominated area. © 1991 International Bee Research Association.","Africanized honey bees; Allozymes; Apis mellifera; Colour sorting; Drone honey bees; Malate dehydrogenase; Mating; Queen honey bees; Release techniques; Trapping",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0040632961

Most of the species visited by bees were perennials. In the seasonal survey (a total of 1 221 bee visits), most visits were made by the long-tongued bumble bee, Bombus pascuorum (447) and by honey bees, Apis mellifera (321). Another long-tongued bumble bee, B. hortorum, was also abundant. The main forage plants important for both long-tongued bumble bee species comprised a seasonal succession of labiates: Lamium album, Stachys sylvatica and Ballota nigra. Plants visited by shorter-tongued bumble bees (6. terrestris/B. lucorum, B. pratorum and B. lapidarius), and honey bees, included Rubus fruticosus agg., Cirsium vulgare, Epilobium hirsutum, Heracleum sphondylium and Brassica napus, and probably other plants outside the survey area. Dawn-to-dusk studies showed that long-tongued bumble bee species were largely responsible for pollinating visits to field bean, Vicia faba, and that B. pascuorum began foraging earlier and finished later in the day than A. mellifera. Bee visits were unevenly distributed among the 18 sections of the farm walk in the seasonal survey. The sections that received most bumble bee (and honey bee) visits supported a seasonal succession of forage plants with abundant Ballota nigra and R. fruticosus agg., E. hirsutum and Brassica napus, and L. album, which was important in early summer. Sections on gravel rather than clay soils and with a hedge and ditch received numerous bumble bee visits. The best sections were areas undisturbed by cultivation or grazing, in which perennials other than Urtica dioica could establish. Bumble bee forage could be improved by managing and extending field margins and other uncultivated areas on the farm. © 1991 International Bee Research Association.","Apis mellifera; Bombus; Bumble bees; Field crops; Field margins; Flowers; Foraging; Honey bees; Plant succession; Pollination; Vegetation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002284282

We recently elucidated the sequence of Pa5, the most abundant and most active variant, towards emulsfied phosphatidylcholines. Here we present the primary structures of Pa2, Pa3 (subvariants a and b) and Pa4, based on Edman degradation of tryptic, endoproteinase Arg‐C and chymotryptic fragments of the reduced and S‐carboxymethylated proteins. Pa1– Pa5, considered collectively, belong to an original class of secretory phospholipases A2 with 141 – 143 residues, a short hydrophobic N‐terminus, 10 half‐cystine residues and an extended C‐terminus. The only known phospholipase A2 with characteristics close enough to be a member of the same class is that present in the venom from the insect Apis mellifera. More specifically, the sequences of Pa3 and Pa5 are almost identical, and those of Pa2 and Pa4 are also quite similar. Both groups diverge enough to indicate the translation of two mRNA species in the venom gland. The primary structure of Pa3 reveals the existence of subvariants a and b, the sequence of which is identical to that previously defined for Pa5, except that the C‐terminal tripeptide GEG in Pa5 is replaced by the dipeptide GE in Pa3a and the tetrapeptide GEGR in Pa3b. Pa4, when compared to Pa5, shows 21 substitutions with a cluster of five modified amino acids in positions 40 – 44, immediately after the catalytic segment amino acids 30 – 39, and added changes scattered before the C‐terminus. Pa2 differs from Pa4 only by the absence of the Gly142 C‐terminal residue. The 15% difference in primary structure observed between the Pa3– Pa5 and Pa2– Pa4 subgroups might be largely responsible for their distinct biological properties. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell.

Video recordings and macrophotography were used to view an area of the dance field. Two distinct behaviours were recognized: that of followers and that of attendants. The attendants stood around the dance field with their antennae stretched towards the dancer, and only occasionally moved with the dancer. Followers continuously ran with the dancer, keeping their heads within the border of the dancer’s figure-eight path at all times. The angle between the body of the follower and that of the dancer was 90° during most of the dance, except at the exit of the waggle run. At that time the follower had to cross over to the opposite side of the dancer. The distance between the head of the follower and the dancer’s body was nearly always smaller (1 758 cases out of a total of 1 882) than the length of an extended antenna. During the return run the follower touched the dancer with antennae most of the time, whereas during the waggle run the followers intermittently touched the dancer. Either one bee (81 % of cases) or two bees (18%) followed the dance simultaneously. The second follower and all other bees were usually pushed out of the follower’s position because of a lack of space at the inner side of the dancer. These observations are discussed in relation to current hypotheses on how bees perceive the dance. © 1991 International Bee Research Association.","Apis mellifera; Attendants; Behaviour; Dance communication; Followers; Honey bees; Recruitment; Video recordings",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001064372

Two classes of colonies were studied: founders, and established colonies. Nests and contents were collected from an experimental site and three control sites following several months of exposure at the experimental site to the apiary honey bee population. Nest contents were analysed for differences among sites in colony population parameters which could have been caused by resource competition with introduced honey bees. Colony founding and overall colony survival were also considered. During the first season, the average number of large larvae plus prepupae per colony was significantly higher in the experimental site than in the control site. This difference could, however, have been the result of a two‐week gap in sampling all the sites. All nest parameters showed high variability and there were no other significant differences between the two kinds of site. In the experimental site during the second season there were, relative to the control sites, significantly fewer total numbers of adult males and females in established nests and in all nests combined, significantly more immatures of all stages in founder nests and significantly lower adult male:female ratio. Although preliminary in nature, the data suggest that, in the experimental plots, E. asimillima showed: (i) increased adult emigration, (ii) increased brood rearing success, and/or (iii) relatively later colony founding, compared to the three controls.

Additional DNA testing is needed to confirm these findings, to understand the processes responsible, and to follow African bee spread into the temperate United States. To facilitate surveys, the polymerase chain reaction was utilized. African and European honeybee mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was identified through amplified segments that carry informative restriction site and length polymorphisms. The ability to discriminate among honeybee subspecies was established by testing a total of 129 colonies from Africa and Europe. Matriline identities could thus be determined for imported New World bees. Among 41 managed and feral colonies in the United States and north Mexico, two European lineages (west and east) were distinguished. From neotropical regions, 72 feral colonies had African mtDNA and 4 had European mtDNA. The results support earlier conclusions that neotropical African bees have spread as unbroken African maternal lineages. Old and New World African honeybee populations exhibit different frequencies of a mtDNA length polymorphism. Through standard analyses, a north African mtDNA type that may have been imported previously from Spain or Portugal was not detected among neotropical African bees.","maternal gene flow; polymerase chain reaction; restriction fragment length polymorphism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025808634

That the pattern is consistent and well-organized suggests its adaptive value for the colony, yet the mechanism of pattern formation has not been elucidated. Two hypotheses are presented. The blueprint (or template) hypothesis suggests that there are particular locations specified for the deposition of eggs, pollen and honey, i.e., the pattern develops as a consequence of the bees filling in the comb according to the orderly arrangement latent in the blueprint. An alternative is the ""self-organization"" hypothesis: pattern emerges spontaneously from dynamic interactions among the processes of depositing and removing brood, pollen and honey, without a plan specifying spatial relationships. Computer simulation of the self-organization hypothesis demonstrates how the colony-level pattern can emerge and how, using only local cues and simple behavioral rules, the bees can create an overall, global pattern of which they have no concept. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026054278

Bees of one subfamily never danced after foraging on a 2 mol/litre sucrose solution, while bees of the other subfamily often did so. Bees of both subfamilies responded to lowered sucrose concentration by reducing the number of foraging trips per hour, although one subfamily altered its rate of foraging more dramatically. When offered a 1 mol/litre sucrose solution at one feeding station and a 3 mol/litre solution at another after training with a 2 mol/litre solution, most bees did not switch to the more profitable feeding station. Rather, they remained faithful to their initial station, but reduced rates of foraging when sucrose concentration was reduced. The mean duration of dances was longer for one subfamily than the other, which increased the number of bees that followed dances performed by bees of that subfamily. Under one set of experimental conditions, dances indicating a 3 mol/litre solution attracted more followers than dances for a 2 mol/litre solution. We speculate that faithfulness to a particular foraging location is adaptive, since the time needed to learn a new location has a cost. We further speculate that genetic variance for rates, duration and attractiveness of dances may be adaptive, since these differences have the effect of spreading subfamilies among locales. Thus honey bee polyandry increases fitness by increasing eclectic foraging. © 1991 International Bee Research Association.","Apis mellifera; Dance communication; Foraging; Genetic variance; Honey bees; Recruitment; Subfamilies; Subfamily differences; Task specialization",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001494479

Evaluation of the nature of hybridization in the Neotropics is, however, confounded by possible population size advantages for the African-derived group5-7. As an alternative approach, genetic interactions can be studied in transition areas between zones ecologically and climatically adaptive for both racial groups. We describe here results of a survey transecting regions populated by African- and European-derived honey bees in Argentina.

The experiments showed honeyeater birds (tui, bellbirds, and silvereyes) had little effect on the honeydew, but that cropping by German wasps (Vespula germanica), and particularly by common wasps (V. vulgaris), in the summer and autumn months markedly reduced the number, size, and sugar concentration of the honeydew drops. The energy in drops per unit area of tree trunk was reduced by at least 99.1%, 98.4%, and 91.3% in January, March, and May, respectively. Wasps reduced the standing crop (number, size, and sugar concentration) of the honeydew drops by cropping them before they could be fully recharged and before evaporation could concentrate the sugars. Cropping by feral honey bees (Apis mellifera) may have reduced the standing crop of honeydew slightly.

In the first habitat, an abandoned grassland (megaphorbe meadow), honey bees comprised 1 % (by numbers) of the 7480 prey items collected from orb‐webs between May and September. Approximately 99 % of the 72 observed cases of prédation on honey bees took place in the second half of summer (August‐September), when the three large orb‐weaver species Argiope bruennichi (Scopoli), Araneus quadratus Clerck and Araneus diadematus Clerck reached full size (matured) and built large, strong (ca. 25 cm diameter) webs. Prédation by these spider species on honey bees in the first half of summer was apparently insignificant (only 1 % of observed prédation events), probably due to their relatively small web and body size. Based on sampling counts of the number of webs per m2 and the number of bees intercepted per web, we estimated that the spiders' prey kill per m2 in the grassland averaged 1 honey bee every 4th day in August, and 1 every 5th day in September during rain free periods. About 95 % of observed orb‐weaver prédation was attributable to A. bruennichi and A. quadratus, while 5 % was due to A. diadematus. The second estimate was made in another abandoned grassland habitat, heavily infested with the thistle Cirsium arvense (L.), in the same geographic area. Honey bees comprised 15 % (by numbers) of 215 prey items collected from webs of the dominant orb‐weaver species (A. bruennichi) during August‐September. We estimated that the A. bruennichi population may have killed approximately 1 honey bee per m2 every 5th day in August during rain free periods. The economic status of orb‐weaving spiders as predators is discussed, and we conclude that despite their activities in killing beneficial arthropods, these spiders should not be addressed as pests. Should bee keepers feel their hives are threatened, relatively innocuous cultural methods can be used in place of hazardous chemicals in the neighborhood of the hive that destroy the orb‐weavers' web‐sites in the grassland (mowing).

Im ersten Habitat, einem Hochstaudenried, machten Honigbienen (zahlenmäßig) 1 % der 7480 Beutetiere aus, die zwischen Mai und September aus Radnetzen gesammelt wurden. Annähernd 99 % der 72 Beobachtungen von Bienenmortalität (verursacht durch Radnetzspinnen) entfielen auf die zweite Sommerhälfte (August‐September), wenn die drei großen Radnetzspinnenarten Argiope bruennichi (Scopoli), Araneus quadratus Clerck und Araneus diadematus Clerck reif waren und große, starke Netze bauten. Basierend auf Netzzählungen und Beutefangbeobachtungen wurde die durch Radnetzspinnen verursachte Bienenvertilgungsrate geschätzt. Gemäß diesen Schätzungen würden Radnetzspinnen im August durchschnittlich ca. 1 Honigbiene pro vier Tage töten, während sie im September ca. 1 Honigbiene pro fünf Tage erbeuten (grobe Schätzungen gültig für regenfreie Tage). Eine zweite Untersuchung über Radnetzspinnen als Bienenfeinde wurde in einem anderen Brachlandhabitat (stark verunkrautet durch Cirsium arvense [L.]) durchgeführt. Gemäß dieser zweiten Schätzung würden Radnetzspinnen (A. bruennichi‐Population) im August ca. 1 Honigbiene pro fünf Tage töten (grobe Schätzung gültig für regenfreie Tage). Wir kamen zum Gesamturteil, daß Radnetzspinnen trotz ihrer Aktivität als Prädatoren von Nützlingen nicht als Schädlinge eingestuft werden sollten.

This protein had physiochemical properties very similar to vertebrate skeletal muscle connectin (titin), although its apparent molecular mass (∼ 1200 kDa) was considerably lower than that of connectin (∼ 3000 kDa). Polyclonal as well as monoclonal antibodies against chicken skeletal muscle connectin reacted with the 1200 kDa protein from crayfish claw muscle. Conversely, polyclonal antibodies against crayfish 1200 kDa protein crossreacted with chicken connectin. Circular dichroic spectra indicated the abundance of β-sheet structure (∼ 60 %). Low-angle shadowed images showed filamentous structures (0.2 ∼ 0.5 μm) by electron microscopy. Proteolysis of the 1200 kDa protein by α-chymotrypsin or V8 protease rapidly resulted in formation of 1000 kDa or 1100 and 800 kDa peptides. The amino acid composition was very similar to those of vertebrate connectins and of honeybee flight muscle projectin. Based on the molecular weight and amino acid composition, the 1200 kDa protein is regarded to be crayfish projectin. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that crayfish projectin was localized in the A/I junction area and A-band except for its centre region in crayfish claw muscles. Polyclonal antibodies against crayfish claw muscle projectin reacted with 1200 kDa projectin of honeybee and beetle flight muscle. A monoclonal antibody against chicken skeletal muscle connectin also reacted with honeybee and beetle projectin. Immunoelectron microscopic observations revealed that anti-crayfish projectin antibodies bound the connecting filaments linking the Z-line and the thick filaments up to the M-line of honeybee muscle sarcomere. Anti-crayfish projectin antibodies bound the I-band region near the Z-line of beetle flight muscle. It is concluded that the 1200 kDa projectin from crayfish claw muscle is an invertebrate connectin (titin). Recent work with locust flight muscle mini-titin (Nave & Weber, 1990) is in good agreement with the present study, except that the isolated minititin estimated as 600 kDa appears to be a proteolytic product (∼ 1100 kDa) of the parent molecule (∼ 1200 kDa). © 1990 Chapman and Hall Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025636028

Substantial reduction in the diameter of the targets, which was designed to facilitate location of the drops, impaired discrimination of the colors, perhaps because their salience was reduced in the process (Experiment 3). White dots used to mark the location of the drops on larger targets also impaired discrimination of the colors, which presumably were overshadowed by the dots (Experiments 1, 2, and 4). That the dots did not serve merely to equate delay but were themselves discriminated was demonstrated in Experiment 5, which produced as well the first indication of an effect of amount of reward uncontaminated by the possibility of differential delay: Animals trained with a 5-μl drop on a dotted target of one color and a drop of the same size on an undotted target of a second color preferred the dotted target, but animals trained with a 5-μl drop on a dotted target of one color and a 20-μl drop on an undotted target of a second color preferred the undotted target. In Experiment 6, with odors substituted for the colors on the assumption that they were less likely to be overshadowed by the dots, what could be interpreted as a pure amount effect was found again. Aside from their relevance to questions about the role of amount of reward, the results have some interesting implications for the theory of discriminative learning in honeybees. © 1990 Psychonomic Society, Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025002117

The model assumes as the essential elements in building activities the bee-wax and bee-bee interactions coupled by means of a feedback mechanism. The construction is represented by a set of dynamical non-linear partial differential equations for the density of bees and the quantity of wax distributed in the hive. Using linear stability analysis the conditions for growth of the coherent spatially ordered inhomogeneous structure are derived. Numerical simulations depicting growth process in the nonlinear regime have been performed, illuminating the role of the competition between bees and the bee-wax interaction.

Honey bees (Apis mellifera, worker) were trained to discriminate between two random gratings oriented perpendicularly to each other. This task was quickly learned with vertical, horizontal, and oblique gratings. After being trained on perpendicularly-oriented random gratings, bees could discriminate between other perpendicularly-oriented patterns (black bars, white bars, thin lines, edges, spatial sinusoids, broken bars) as well. 2. Several tests indicate that the stimuli were not discriminated on the basis of a literal image (eidetic template), but, rather, on the basis of orientation as a single parameter. An attempt to train bees to discriminate between two different random gratings oriented in the same direction was not successful, also indicating that the bees were not able to form a template of random gratings. 3. Preliminary experiments with oriented 'Kanizsa rectangles' (analogue of Kanizsa triangle) suggest that edge detection in the bee may involve mechanisms similar to those that lead to the percept of illusory contours in humans. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.","Honey bees; Kanizsa rectangle; Orientation discrimination; Template model; Visual pattern recognition",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025244204

Combined behavioral and chemical analyses were conducted under natural and controlled conditions. First the distribution of forager bees' visits on two pairs of sunflower genotypes producing a different level of hybrid seed yield was recorded under pollen-proof tunnels. Mirasol parental lines producing high seed yields were visited at random, whereas forager bees visited preferentially the female parental line of Marianne, resulting in low seed yield. Nectar samples collected on the genotypes were analyzed by gas chromatography. Fructose, glucose, and sucrose were identified. Parental lines of Mirasol showed similar sugar profiles, whereas the female line of Marianne contained higher amounts of sucrose than the male line. We assume that the bees' preferences between genotypes might rely on differences in the sugar composition of floral nectars, especially in the amount of sucrose. Aromas from headspace collection were compared between pairs and periodically during the flowering period. Of the 144 components indexed for Marianne lines and 136 components for Mirasol lines, 17 of the components for Marianne lines and 18 for Mirasol lines differed significantly according to flowering stage. Significant differences appeared in eight of the 134 components of Marianne lines and in 20 of the 250 components for Mirasol lines. Such differences, even restricted to a few components, might account for honeybees' discrimination between genotypes or flowering stage. Experiments then were conducted in a flight room using an artificial flower device. A total volatile extract was used as a conditioning scent previous to the test where the total extract was successively compared to several of its subfractions. Fractions significantly less visited than the total extract were discarded, whereas fractions confused with the total extract were kept. From step to step, a restricted fraction of 28 polar components, among which 15 were identified, was shown to be as active as the initial conditioning extract. These data emphasized honeybees' abilities to generalize from simplified to more complex chemical information. Finally, this work considers the possible use of such plant chemicals, from nectars or aromas, either as targets for genetic modification of crop plants or as direct attractants when sprayed on the crop, for the improvement of entomophilous cross pollination. © 1990 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","Apidae; Apis mellifera; aroma; conditioning; foraging behavior; Helianthus annuus; honeybee; Hymenoptera; nectar; olfactory discrimination; plant chemicals; pollination; Sunflower",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001035220

Previous studies in our laboratory led to the determination of the base sequence of the SpV4 DNA . Nine open reading frames and three promoterlike sequences (P1, P2, and P3) were identified. An inverted repeat leading to the formation of a hairpin structure on the transcription product was also found and predicted to be a transcription terminator (T). We have now studied the in vivo transcription of the SpV4 genome by Northern (RNA) blot analysis of the total RNAs extracted from SpV4-infected spiroplasma cells. Transcripts of 7.8, 4.4, 3.4, and 2.7 kilobases (kb) were detected. The 3.4-kb RNA was the major transcript. The 5' and 3' ends of this transcript were determined by S1 mapping and primer extension. Characterization of the 3' end by S1 mapping showed that the 3.4-kb transcript terminates within the stretch of uridine residues following the hairpin structure of terminator T. Characterization of the 5' end by S1 mapping indicated that transcription proceeds from a newly recognized promoter, PO, located 36 nucleotides upstream of P1. Primer extension resulted in two cDNA signals. The short cDNA was probably a primer extension artifact due to the presence of a hairpin structure on the transcript. When reverse transcriptase stopped at this hairpin or read through, the short or the long cDNA, respectively, was obtained. The size of the long cDNA identified PO as the transcription promoter. Promoter PO was also shown to be functional in Escherichia coli. Indeed, when inserted upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene of a promoter selected vector, it promoted transcription of this gene. As in the case of S. melliferum, two cDNAs were obtained by primer extension, the longer cDNA identifying PO as the promoter.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024991122

Midgut epithelia were composed of regenerative cells, endocrine cells, and pleomorphic columnar cells. Regions of the midgut were encountered in which the cytogeny of the columnar cells, the content of discharged vesicles, and the structure of the peritrophic membrane varied. In 5-day-old bees, regional variation in the ultrastructure of the cells indicated that absorption occurred primarily in the middle of the gut and that regulated enzyme secretion appeared to be confined to the posterior midgut. In 30-day-old bees, reduced pollen consumption was accompanied by diminished cell activity in the posterior midgut. Our ultrastructural data suggest that the honey bee, like other insects, may rely on countercurrent flow to distribute enzymes and nutrients efficiently throughout the ectoperitrophic and endoperitrophic compartments.

When experienced foragers of Apis mellifera arrived at a gravity feeder from the hive, thoracic temperature (TTH) was independent of sucrose concentration (X = 36.3 °C). While imbibing 40% and 60% (g solute per g of solution) solutions bees maintained TTH at approximately the same high level as upon arrival, but those imbibing 10%, 20%, and 30% solutions regulated TTH lower (X = 33.5 °C). All bees departed the feeder for the hive at the same TTH (X = 36.1 °C). Bees that imbibed 40% and 60% solutions sometimes immediately took flight after imbibition and averaged less than 15 s to takeoff. Time to takeoff was 2-3 times longer for bees that had imbibed 10% and 20% solutions because warmup preceded takeoff. The rate of energy expenditure at TTH=36.3°C (at 40% and 60% solutions) was 20% greater than that at 33.3°C (at 10%, 20%, and 30% solution). Bees that fed on the highly concentrated solutions regulated TTH so that rate of net energy gain was enhanced, but bees that fed on less concentrated solutions could have increased rate of net gain by maintaining a higher TTH which would have reduced time required for takeoff.

Due to a paucity of genetic markers, genetic interactions between European and African bees are not well understood. Three restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), detected with random, nuclear DNA probes, are described. The polymorphisms are specific to bees of European descent, possibly specific to certain European races. Each European marker was found present at a high frequency in U.S. colonies but absent in South African bees. Previous mitochondrial DNA studies of neotropical bees have revealed negligible maternal gene flow from managed European apiaries into feral African populations. The findings reported here with nuclear DNA show paternal gene flow between the two but suggest asymmetries in levels of introgressive hybridization. Managed colonies in southern Mexico, derived from European maternal lines, showed diminished levels of the European nuclear markers, reflecting significant hybridization with African drones. The European alleles were present only at low frequencies in feral swarms from the same area. The swarms were of African maternal descent. In Venezuelan colonies, also derived from African maternal lines, the European markers were almost totally absent. The results point to limited paternal introgression from European colonies into the African honeybee populations. These findings dispute other views regarding modes of Africanization.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025367883

Visual marks were offered on the inner surface of a cylinder placed in front of the disc (Fig. 2), thus projecting onto peripheral (nonfrontal) regions of the bees' eye. The trained bees were tested by recording their choices among the holes. 2. Bees use the memorized position of peripheral marks to localize the frontally positioned goal (Figs. 6-9). The effectiveness of a mark depends on its retinal position, the most effective marks being lateral ones (Figs. 8, 9). 3. Altering the dimensions of the mark does not influence the distribution of the bees' choice (Figs. 11-13). Thus, image motion rather than image size is used for distance estimation in the present task. 4.

Rate of net energy gain was used as a measure of profitability. Individual bees repeatedly chose between a yellow and a blue tubular artificial flower which had different associated profitabilities. Handling costs were manipulated by using flowers of different depth;energy gains were manipulated by using different volumes of a 20% (w/w) sucrose solution. Bees' discrimination between the two flowers increased as the absolute difference in profitabilities increased and discrimination decreased as profitabilities of both flowers increased. Therefore, discrimination depended on the relative difference in profitability between flowers, and therefore, perception was a nonlinear function of actual rates of net energy gain. The results also suggested that motivation to choose between flowers depended on the level of profitability. We suggest that nonlinear perceptual scales and motivation should be incorporated into models of food choice as constraints and should be considered in the design of experiments used to test predictions of models and in the interpretation of experimental results. © 1990 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","choice behavior; foraging; honey bees; perceptual scales; profitability",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001083846

The antibody was found to label rows of nuclei in the transverse grooves that form the earliest external sign of metameric germ band organization. These grooves demarcate metameric units about seven cell rows wide, of which about three rows with reduced apical cell surfaces account for the grooves. The en stripes appear in the grooves as soon as these form and grow from one to about four cells in width and thus completely overlap the groove. During the rudimentary germ band retraction, the grooves shift slightly backwards relative to both the en stripes and the trachdeal pits. The spatio-temporal pattern by which the series of grooves and stripes arises is quite striking. Both become visible first in the gnathal and thoracic regions, then in the pregnathal parts of the head and in the abdomen. The stripes arise essentially in an antero-posterior sequence. In addition, the earliest stripes to form display a pattern of alternating intensities whereas the later stripes, those in the abdomen, arise with approximately equal strength. The latter trait was earlier observed in the grasshopper, while the former is known from Drosophila where, however, the strong stripes correspond to the weak stripes in the honeybee. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.","Engrailed; Gastrulation; Honeybee; Segmentation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025360064

Furthermore, no Z(175) antigens have been detected in the non-fibrillar tissue by either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies localize the a and Z(400) antigens at the Z-line in leg muscle fibrils. Surprisingly, however, mAb P binds within the A-bands of synchronous fibres, not between the A- and Z-bands as in asynchronous fibrillar muscle. © 1990 Chapman and Hall Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025327740

Upon antigenic stimulation with the denatured phospholipase A2 and autologous monocytes or by cross-linking of CD3 by anti-CD3 antibody, the activated T cells, which had propagated by IL-2 alone, formed N-glycosylated IgE-binding factors and glycosylation enhancing factor (GEF), while those propagated in the presence of lipocortin formed unglycosylated IgE-binding factors and glycosylation inhibiting factor (GIF). The GEF and GIF formed by the antigen- or anti-CD3-stimulated T cells had affinity for bee venom phospholipase A2 and could be purified by using anti-lipomodulin Sepharose. In the mouse lymphocyte system, the major cell source of GIF is antigen-specific suppressor T cells, and the antigen-binding GIF from the cells suppressed the in vivo antibody response in an antigen (carrier)-specific manner. In view of the findings in the mouse system, the present results may provide an immunological maneuver to generate allergen-specific suppressor T cells, and to obtain allergen-specific suppressor factor from T cell populations in the peripheral blood of allergic patients. © 1990.","Bee venom phospholipase A2; IgE-binding factor; Lipocortin; Suppressor T cell factor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025176465

However, the factors influencing absconding during this period were unclear, and there were no distinct differences in nest characteristics of the absconding and nonabsconding colonies.

However, in two of the three colonies examined recruitment activity indicated the general direction of colony travel. The distances indicated by these dancers ranged between 6 and 16 km.

The glands are paired and each lateral half consists of two parts, a smaller external and a larger internal lobe. The lobes are composed of densely packed secretory tubes and ducts, the tubes of which often show ramifications. A reservoir is packed within the anterior medial part of the gland. The secretory tubes are composed of two types of cells, secretory cells, which are most frequent, and parietal cells. Secretory cells are characterized by a basal labyrinth, abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum, dark secretory vesicles, light vesicles of different sizes, and apical microvilli. Parietal cells are smaller and have a characteristically lobed nucleus and no secretory vesicles. Between the cells there are intercellular canaliculi. In the center of each tube there is an extracellular space with a central cuticular channel. The abundance of rough endoplasmic reticulum and the rare occurrence of smooth endoplasmic reticulum implies a saliva with proteins but rarely with pheromones. Between the secretory tubes there are frequently neuronal profiles which are partly in contact with the secretory cells. Thus a nervous control of this gland is, in contrast to previous investigations, clearly demonstrated. The axonal endings contain dark neurosecretory vesicles as well as light synaptic vesicles. Large parts of the glands are surrounded by a thin tissue sheath which has a smooth surface towards the secretory tubes and shows irregular protrusions towards the outer side. This sheath is considered to be a tracheal air sac, and due to its large extension is probably of importance for the hemolymph flow in the thorax. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0040845438

Nectars of butterfly-pollinated flower tend to have higher concentrations of amino acids than do flowers pollinated by bees and many other animals, suggesting that amino acids are important attractants of butterflies to flowers. In order to determine whether amino acids are important in attracting butterflies and bees, we tested the preference of cabbage white butterflies (Pieris rapae) and honey bees (Apis mellifera) by allowing them to feed from artificial flowers containing sugar-only or sugar-amino acid mimics of Lantana camara nectar. Honey bees and female cabbage white butterflies consumed more sugar-amino acid nectar than sugar-only nectar. In addition, female cabbage white butterflies visited artificial flowers containing sugar-amino acid nectars more frequently than flowers containing sugar-only nectars; honey bees spent more time consuming the sugar-amino acid nectar. Male cabbage white butterflies did not discriminate between the two nectars.

The first is designed to evaluate how easily bees can be conditioned to discriminate between two odors and how willing they are to generalize between closely related odors. In particular, we demonstrate that individual worker bees have no trouble learning to discriminate between alkyl ketones or alcohols that differ by only one carbon atom (e.g. heptanone versus octanone) or between a ketone and alcohol functional group attached to the same alkyl radical; but they generalize between compounds with the same functional group much more readily than those with the same alkyl radical. The second experiment is designed to explore the relationship between the perception of a mixture of odorants and the perception of the individual odorants themselves. Our results suggest that there appears to be a stronger relationship between a two-odorant mixture and its constituents than would be suggested by the mixture being an odor intermediate between the two constituent odorants. We also include a comprehensive discussion on the problem of extracting quality and concentration information from an odor stimulus and we explore ideas relating to the perception of the constituent odorant components of complex odors. © 1990 Oxford University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025034702

We mimicked this process by injecting bees with live bacteria and isolated five induced antibacterial substances by comparative liquid chromatographic mapping of the hemolymph. Three of these antibiotics belong to a unique family of small (18 amino acids) peptides: the apidaecins [Casteels et al. (1989) EMBO J. 8, 2387–2391]. We have now characterized a fourth bee immune response peptide. The complete sequence was established by Edman degradation of the peptide and fragments thereof. It is 34 amino acids long and contains 10 proline residues. The amino‐terminal half is related to the apidaecins; similar proline motifs are also present in the aminoterminal quarter of the much longer fly diptericins. The newly identified peptide's broad spectrum, lower specific activities against Gram‐negative plant pathogens and its inability to inhibit bacterial growth at medium ionic strength are different from the apidaecins. Moreover, the highest observed specific activity was against an apidaecin‐resistant Xanthomonas strain. In contrast to the immediate action of apidaecins, bactericidal activity is delayed. We propose the name ‘abaecin’ for this new antibacterial response peptide. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025058306

Bees were trained to coloured cardboards either at the hive entrance or at the feeding station. Positive correlations were detected between olfactory/mechanosensory conditioning and visual learning. Good and poor learners from strains selected for olfactory conditioning differed significantly in their visual learning values. These strain differences reflect genetic differences in a common learning system rather than task specific differences in sensory, motor or motivational components. Parameters that were influenced by activity of the colony (duration of stay at the feeding place, time between visits) also differed among selected strains. These effects were not due to selection. Instead, they reflect a specific genetic background produced in each strain independently of selection. The results indicate that associative learning has a genetic basis which is independent of the sensory stimuli associated with reward, the learning procedure (classical conditioning or instrumental learning) or the motor patterns used to execute the learned behavior (proboscis extension, control for flight behavior, open field orientation). © 1990, Springer-Verlag.

Immuno-reactivity is found in about 120 perikarya of the brain and in about 30 of the suboesophageal ganglion. These cells are distributed in 13 paired clusters representing neurons of different types including neurosecretory neurons projecting to neurohemal organs. Immunoreactivity of different intensity is found in the non-glomerular neuropil around the mushroom bodies, in the lateral protocerebrum, the central body, the optic tubercles, the lobula and medulla of optic lobe, the ocellar neuropil, in multiglomerular elements of the antennal lobes and in the dorsal deuterocerebrum. In the mushroom bodies, immuno-reactivity is located in layers of the lobes and stalks, corresponding to intrinsic fibre bundles of some Kenyon cell types. The somata of these intrinsic cells did not show FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity. Electron microscopy of immunostained somata and nerve fibres was performed employing a pre-embedding peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique. Fibres of optic lobes and the non-glomerular neuropil contain immunoreactive dense core vesicles (diameter 50-165 nm) accumulated in boutons besides small synaptic vesicles and synaptic membrane specializations. Immunoreactive layers of the mushroom body neuropil were analysed at the ultrastructural level. Axon profiles with dense-core vesicles of a small type (diameter 35-75 nm) show only faint immunoreactive products. Immunoreactivity of intrinsic mushroom body neurons does not appear to be specifically correlated with synapses and synaptic organelles.

The degree of integration, measured by the eigenvalue variance of the correlation matrix or by Cheverud's index of integration, varies considerably between races but covaries neither with overall body size nor with the variance of the respective sample. Hence, the degree of morphological integration does not depend on body size or the level of variability The patterns of morphometric correlation are significantly similar among all races, but some minor differences in the patterns could be detected: The similarity between the correlation matrices is independent of the degree of phylogenetic relatedness between the respective races. In all races characters belonin to the same functional and/or developmental unit (leg, wing, abdominal characters) have Eiter correlations than the average. Most of the variation in the pattern of correlation can be expfained as a side effect of variation in the degree of integration. Races with high levels of integration tend to have hiher correlations between the main groups of characters, and races with low levels of integration tave smaller correlations between the main grous of characters, while the basic pattern remains undisturbed. In summary, the comparative analysis of morphometric correlation matrices reveals a picture of stability with respect to the pattern of integration and of variation in the degree of integration, which is random with respect to body size, degree of variability, and phylogeny.

An ability of bees to detect infected brood, as a function of the number of parasites associated with the host, correlates significantly with observed data. Such a prophylactic strategy could regulate parasite density, because parasite mortality would increase more rapidly than brood host mortality.

We suggest that this paradox results from a reduction in the mortality threshold at high mite densities, concealing mortality from our truncation procedures.

Progeny of these bees have now largely colonized the American tropics. Their imminent arrival in the United States poses a serious threat to the beekeeping industry and to agriculture dependent on honeybee pollination. African and European bees are morphologically very similar. DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms are proving successful in distinguishing between the two. Several DNA markers specific to European honeybees have been described previously. Reported here are three cloned honeybee DNA probes that reveal polymorphisms that appear to be either African or European specific. Of fourteen alleles or haplotypes identified, five were present only in African and neotropical (Venezuelan and Mexican) African bees but absent in European‐derived bees, two were present only in European‐derived bees but absent in samples from South Africa. Another allele showed apparent frequency differences among populations. Such markers are useful in studying the genetics of neotropical African bee populations. Venezuelan and Mexican honeybee colonies show a preponderance of the African alleles with low levels of the European alleles. These observations of nuclear DNA, revealing limited paternal European introgression, together with previous mitochondrial DNA findings showing negligible European maternal gene flow into feral African populations, indicate that neotropical African bees are primarily African.

Although only 30% of the regional flora are post-fire seed regenerators, these species were preferentially used by both the honey bee and native bee foragers. Fire, especially close-interval recurrent fire, can have a deleterious effect on the major melliferous species. Perennial reseeding species had a higher projective foliage cover than perennial sprouting species, but had lower cover at sites with shorter intervals between fires. A short interval between fires which decreases the local abundance of reseeding species may reduce the ability of a population to attract pollinators and, combined with the effect of a short interval between fires, may lead to the decline and eventual extinction of the population. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025243138

Mean initial fruit set was 5.0 per panicle, representing a percentage fruit set of 15.5%.

Wind and night flying insects played no role in pollination. Although 98% of flowers were pollinated, initial fruit set averaged only 15.5%.

Subtle differences in the inflorescences have been detected, for example, there are more flowers per inflorescence on male plants than on female plants and petal expansion from the day of opening to the next day is greater in females than in males; in addition, pollen from female plants appears somewhat collapsed and does not germinate. Pollinators (Apis mellifera, other bees (Apidae), Eristalis tenax and other Syrphidae: Diptera) visit the blossoms mostly in the morning to collect pollen (there is no nectar) and in choice experiments do not discriminate between male flowers and female flowers on landing, but do spend significantly more time on the former. They do discriminate between freshly opened flowers and day‐old flowers, and show marked preference for bouquets of five flowers vs. single flowers. The female plants, with smaller inflorescences and lesser interest to pollen foraging insects, seem to encourage them to forage at more flowers than do their male counterparts.

In this situation queens should be selected to reduce the variance in the production of diploid male offspring by multiple mating. It has been suggested that this concave relationship occurs in species such as the honey bee, Apis mellifera, in which reproduction occurs near the peak of colony population. This paper suggests that the timing of diploid male removal may influence mating frequency, with early removal of diploid males favoring multiple mating and late removal of diploid males favoring single mating. This idea is explored in two ways. A mathematical model shows that cell use in the brood area of species that rear young in cells will be more efficient with multiple mating. This would favor multiple mating in species, such as the honey bee, in which brood rearing is constrained by the usable area of the brood chamber. Secondly, comparison of polyandrous honey bees (early removal of diploid males as young larvae) with monandrous fire ants, Solenopsis invicta, and Melipona bees (non-removal of immature diploid males) suggests that in the species without diploid male removal, variance reduction may reduce queen fitness.

In particular, we tested the prediction that bees from small, fast growing colonies should adopt higher workloads than those from large, mature colonies. Queenright “small” colonies were set up by assembling 10 000 worker bees with approximately 4100 brood cells. Queenright “large” colonies contained 35 000 bees and some 14 500 brood cells. Thus, treatments differed in colony size but not in worker/brood ratios. Differences in workload were tested in the context of single foraging cycles. Individuals could forage on a patch of artificial flowers offering given quantities and qualities of nectar rewards. Workers of small colonies took significantly less nectar in an average foraging excursion (small: 40.1 ± 1.1 SE flowers; large: 44.8 ± 1.1), but spent significantly more time handling a flower (small: 7.3 ± 0.4 s ; large: 5.8 ± 0.4 s). When the energy budgets for an average foraging trip were calculated, individuals from all colonies showed a behavior close to maximization of net energetic efficiency (i.e., the ratio of net energetic gains to energetic costs). However, bees from small colonies, while incurring only marginally smaller costs, gained less net energy per foraging trip than those from large colonies, primarily as a result of prolonged handling times. The differences between treatments were largest during the initial phases of the experimental period when also colony development was maximally different. Our results are at variance with simple models that assume natural selection to have shaped behavior in a single foraging trip only so as to maximize colony growth. © 1990, Springer-Verlag.

Indeed, it appears that a parasite of social insects has in essence to adapt to two hosts: first, the individual worker within a colony, the numbers of which grow linearly and second, to the colony itself, the actual reproductive 'organism'. Transmission also has vertical and horizontal components. Analysis of tracheal mite populations in particular suggests that intracolony parasite levels are regulated by the swarming behavior of their hosts1. Ironically, current and highly productive methods of honey bee management with movable hives curb swarming and may contribute to increasing the spread and the impact of some parasites. This insight may result in changing management practices to reduce the detrimental effects of bee parasites. © 1990.",,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025085608

In subsequent tests the reward was removed and the behaviour of the bees was observed and recorded on video-tape while they landed on the experimental arrangement in search of the reward. The spatial distribution of the landings was analysed to measure the detectability of the discs and attractiveness of their boundaries, as compared to the interior regions. The results reveal that, while landing on figures, bees pay special attention to the edges. Even though the reward is placed at a randomly chosen location within the figure during training, the bees show a distinct preference for landing near the boundary of the figure. The bees' preference for edges is restricted to figures with boundaries that provide contrast to the green-sensitive receptors. When the boundaries contain no green contrast, the edge preference disappears. In this situation, landings continue to occur mainly within the figure, but they tend to be distributed randomly over its entire surface. Thus, whereas colour information can mediate the detection of objects uper se, the detection of edges, at least in the context of landing on a figure, is a colour-blind performance that is driven primarily by signals from the bee's green-sensitive photoreceptors. This finding has interesting parallels in primate vision, where edge detection is also colour-blind. On the basis of these findings, we propose that edges provide cues that play an important role in guiding landing manouevres towards objects of interest, such as flowers.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025124571

The flower phenology was studied and amounts of nectar secreted and nectar sugar concentrations determined. During the 4 days of its bloom, a single flower secretes 4 ml of nectar, which contain nearly half a gram of sugar. There was a high correlation between the foraging behaviour of the honey bees and the stages of nectar secretion and pollen release.

For flowers receiving a single honey bee visit, corolla size was positively correlated with pollen removal, but not with pollen deposition on stigmas or seed production. Flowers receiving an average of 3.7 honey bee visits (in 1987) also showed a correlation between corolla size and pollen removal. When flowers were visited an average c5.7 times by honey bees (1988) there was no significant relationship between corolla size and either pollen removal or estimates of female reproductive success (pollen deposition on stigmas and seed production). Honey bees demonstrated a preference for large flowers, either by significantly overvisiting large flowers or by visiting the large flowers before visiting smaller flowers. Most radish flowers receive numerous visits, but even with frequent visitation, at least 20% of the pollen a flower produced was not removed. Flowers with greater pollen production had a larger proportion of pollen removed. Pollen removal was a positive decelerating function of honey bee visitation frequency. Number of pollen grains removed per visit declined with increasing honey bee visits. The male fitness function (pollen removal plotted against pollen production) was positive and decelerating in 2 experiments; positive and linear in one study.

In Experiment 1, allozyme analyses of workers and worker-derived drone larvae revealed that in half the colonies, there were genotypic differences in worker egg-laying behavior (presumed to involve actual oviposition), but biases in drone production were not always consistent with biases in egg-laying behavior. In Experiment 2, allozyme analyses again revealed intracolonial differences in egg-laying behavior and in behavior patterns thought to involve oophagy and larval care. Data support the hypothesis of a genetic influence on this intracolonial behavioral variation. Differences in the genotypic distributions of worker-derived drones relative to workers engaged in oviposition behavior in queenless colonies may be a consequence of genetic variability for egg production or for treatment of eggs and larvae (possibly coupled with kin recognition), or both. © 1990, Springer-Verlag.

These defenders have an open-ended age distribution similar to that of foragers, but defensive behavior is initiated at a younger age than foraging is. Behavioral and genetic evidence shows that defenders and foragers are distinct groups of older workers. Behaviorally, defenders have less worn wings than foragers, suggesting less flight activity. Genetically, defenders differ in allozyme frequencies, demonstrating different subfamily composition from foragers in the same colony. They also differ in allozyme frequencies from guards in the same colony, providing further evidence for division of labor associated with colony defense.

'LD50 distances' are determined for both ground and aerial spraying of ground crops in Britain using published data on spray deposition under various weather conditions. For ground spraying at low wind speeds (≤ 3 m s-1), this zone of risk is up to 5 m for the great majority of compounds. Aerial spraying in unstable atmospheric conditions appears to produce drift deposits of about the same order of magnitude as from ground spraying at wind speeds of about 4 m s-1, with maximum LD50 distances of ≤40 m for chlorpyrifos, fenitrothion and triazophos.

The morphology and function of the basal stalk suggest that the claw-like structure are the ungues; the median plate is the unguifer, and the median ridge is the tendon of the retractor/depressor muscles of the pretarsus. The significance of the pretarsal suckers to the control of the mite is also discussed. © 1990 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025176503

Box 475, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Free flying bees were trained to collect a reward of sugar-water from a structured figure, placed at a randomly varying location on a sheet of transparent Perspex, positioned 5 cm above a structured background. During subsequent tests, done in the absence of a reward, the bees' landings on the boundaries of the figure, as well as within the figure and outside it, were recorded. The same bees were also tested with the figure placed directly on the background, thus eliminating the difference in height between the figure and the background. The results of both types of tests were then compared to identify and investigate the cues that bees use to detect a structured figure, when presented over a structured background. The structure of both the figure and the background were varied in a series of experiments, training a fresh group of bees in each experiment. A randomly structured figure presented against a randomly structured background cannot be detected by the bees unless it is raised above the background. A height difference of 2 cm is sufficient to elicit a rate of landings on the figure that is significantly higher than the chance level. The detectability of the figure does not depend upon the shape of the figure or on differences in density between the structures of the figure and the background. Thus, in detecting the raised figure, the only cue used by the bees appears to be the apparent motion of the figure relative to the background. The majority of landings on a raised figure occur at its boundaries. This shows that the visual stimulus that is crucial in detecting the figure is the local discontinuity in apparent motion that occurs at the boundary. We refer to this as 'boundary parallax'. In a series of experiments that used a striped background and a variety of structured figures, three different types of boundary parallax were offered to the bees. These were: (i) 'covering parallax', at a boundary in which stripes on either side of the boundary are parallel to the boundary; (ii) 'shearing parallax' in which stripes on either side are perpendicular to the boundary and (iii) 'orthological parallax', in which the stripes on one side are perpendicular to those on the other side. The bees performed very well at detecting raised boundaries that offered covering or shearing parallax, despite the fact that such boundaries are not readily discernible on the basis of their static geometry. On the other hand, bees performed poorly in detecting raised boundaries that offered orthogonal parallax, despite the fact that such boundaries are geometrically quite vidid to the human eye. We propose two neural models for the detection of boundary parallax that account for the sensitivity of bees to covering and shearing parallax and their insensitivity to orthogonal parallax.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025096736

Unusual kinetic features were observed in the cleacage reactions of sucrose, maltose, p-nitropheny α-glucoside, phenyl α-gluscoside, turanose, and maltodextrin (DP= 13). At relatively high substrate concentrations, the velocities of liberation of fructose from sucrose, glucose from maltose, p-nitrophenol from p-nitrophenyl a-glucoside, and phenol from phenyl a-glucoside were accelerate, and so the Linewear-Burk plots were conver, indicating negative kinetic cooperativity: the Hill coefficients were calculated to be 0.50, 0.64, and 0.67 for sucrose, maltose, p-nitrophenylαglucoside, and phenyl α-glucoside, respectively. For the degradation of turanose and maltodextrin, the enzyme showed a sigmoidal curve in v versus s plots and thus catalyzed the reaction with positive kinetic cooperativity.

Purification allows for the first characterization of a vitellogenin from the large order Hymenoptera. Hymenopteran vitellogenins are unusual among insect vitellogenins in that they contain only one type of apoprotein. The honey bee vitellogenin was isolated from hemolymph of honey bee queens by a combination of density gradient ultracentrifugation, ion‐exchange chromatography, and affinity chromatography. The native vitellogenin particle is a very high density glycolipoprotein containing approximately 91% protein, 7% lipid, and 2% carbohydrate. Phospholipid and diacylglycerol are the major lipid components. The equilibrium density (1.28 g/ml) is the same as that for Manduca sexta vitellogenin, which contains a much higher proportion of lipid. The covalently bound carbohydrate moiety of the particle is high in mannose. The amino acid composition of vitellogenin is similar to those of vitellogenins from other insect species. The N‐terminal amino acid sequence of the apoprotein was determined, the first such sequence for any insect vitellogenin. When analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)‐gel electrophoresis A. mellifera vitellogenin resolved into a single band with an apparent Mr of 180,000. Gel filtration under reducing and native conditions yielded estimated Mr values of about 300,000.

The objective was to determine if each queen received equal proportions of marked sperm. In two experiments having semen mixtures with about 50% marked sperm, the 95% confidence interval for percent marked progeny was ±9·7% among the 22 queens in group 1 (semen was diluted 1:1 and stirred for 3–5 min) and ±9·0% among the 16 queens in group 6 (semen diluted 1:40 and centrifuged).

Nonrandom changes in progeny frequencies were related to insemination volume, time, and sperm handling procedures. Since nonmixing would cause random changes in progeny frequencies, much of the variability may have been caused by sperm competition rather than nonmixing. © 1990 International Bee Research Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000714166

Regression analysis at freezing temperature showed that the two races attain similar costs of energy balance with the same mass when Africanized colonies contain about 20,000 bees and European colonies contain 16,000 bees (Fig. 1). 3. 3. Africanized honey bees tested in groups at temperatures of 2°C and -15°C, showed metabolic rates that were 13-109% higher than those of the temperate region honey bees, but at 22.5°C, the cost of energy maintenance was 54% lower. We predict that physiological and behavioral characteristics combined with climatic conditions in North America will limit the northern distribution of nesting Africanized honey bees to a 120 consecutive day isoline of temperatures not exceeding 10°C during Winter (Fig. 2). In some southern regions of the USA, the Africanized race will have competitive advantage over the European honey bees now extant. © 1990.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025050906

Areas containing empty drone cells were significantly warmer than those containing empty worker cells, while worker larvae and pupae had significantly higher temperatures than those of drones. Worker brood was maintained at a significantly higher temperature than drone brood in the central broodnest (frames 4–6) while not significantly different in the outer broodnest regions. Drone brood temperatures were significantly lower than those of workers in the upper, lower and peripheral comb octads, while not significantly different in the central octads. In colonies used for temperature readings, the distribution of worker and drone brood was related to broodnest temperature when broodnest position was not considered. A similar relationship, however, was not found for most frame and comb octad positions. Drone pupae distribution patterns found in other colonies could not be related to these broodnest temperature differentials. Since adult bees are responsible for colony thermoregulation, their distribution in the broodnest, in conjunction with brood metabolism, may cause the observed temperature differences associated with developmental brood stage and broodnest position. © 1990 International Bee Research Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0039313773

Association with the treated workers retarded ovary development of the untreated cagemates when compared to sister bees in identical cages that contained no bees given CO2.

Experimental studies in the Cape honey bee (Apis mellifera capensis) reveal a huge genetic variation for individual fitness of workers. The present study with a one locus, two allele model for reproductive dominance of workers shows that a balanced system between colony level and individual within colony selection plausibly explains the phenomenon of a high genetic variance of worker fitness. In particular, a frequent occurrence of queenless colonies in the population leads to stable polymorphic equilibria. Also the multiple mating system of the honey bee queen supports the propagation of alleles causing reproductive dominance of workers. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000949072

The spectral sensitivities of the photoreceptors in the compound eye of the stingless bee, Melipona quadrifasciata (Hymenoptera, Apoidea), was determined by the spectral scanning method. Three spectral receptor types were found with λmax at 356 nm, 424 nm, and 532 nm (Fig. 1). Intracellular markings confirmed one morphological type of green receptor (svf 1) and one type of UV receptor (1vf 1) whose axon morphology resembles that of the corresponding spectral receptor types in the honeybee, Apis mellifera (Fig. 2). 2. Training experiments with a large number of color signals were performed at the hive entrance and the feeding place under natural daylight conditions (Figs. 4-6). The tests were either dual (2 alternative color signals) choice tests or multiple (12 simultaneously presented alternative color signals) choice tests. Melipona discriminates colors very well in both behavioral contexts, but discrimination is generally better at the feeding place (Fig. 7). A comparison with Apis shows that Melipona discriminates colors in the bluish green better than Apis, and that Apis discriminates all other colors better. 3. The spectral properties of the receptor types were used to construct a color space in which all the color signals tested in the behavioral experiments are represented at particular loci (Fig. 3). A receptor model of color vision as proposed by Backhaus and Menzel (1987) for the honeybee is used to calculate the perceptual distance between the colors corresponding to the loci of the color stimuli. This model interprets the perceptual distance between two color stimuli as the number of just noticeable difference steps in the corresponding receptor voltage signals. The predicted distances are highly correlated with the discrimination values of the behavioral tests (Fig. 12). © 1989 Springer-Verlag.","Color vision; Melipona quadrifasciata; Photoreceptors; Spectral sensitivities; Stingless bee",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024786660

This result requires explanation both of why workers produce any males, and, since they do, why they produce so few. Workers may maximize their inclusive fitness by forgoing reproduction, or their sterility may be due to to enforcement of the interests of the queen or those of other workers. The presence of laying workers might then result from developmental noise in the workers, from a failure of communication of the queen's presence, or a failure of enforcement mechanisms. Selection for worker reproduction in colonies following queen loss may also play a role in shaping worker reproduction in colonies with a queen.

Long, dim steps of light (5 min) produced either a decrease or an increase in [Ca2+]o depending strongly on the previous illumination.

During the summer season the temperature in the brood nest averages 35.5°C with brief excursions up to 37.0°C and down to 33.8°C. Increasing environmental temperatures resulted in linear increases in the temperature of the hive entrance, its periphery and its centre. The temperature in the centre of an overwintering cluster is maintained at an average value of 21.3°C (min 12.0°C, max 33.5°C). With rising ambient temperatures the central temperature of a winter cluster drops whereas the peripheral temperature increases slightly. With decreasing external temperatures the peripheral temperature is lowered by a small amount while the cluster's centre temperature is raised. Linear relationships are observed between the central and the ambient temperature and between the central temperature and the temperature difference of the peripheral and the ambient temperatures. The slopes point to two minimum threshold values for the central (15°C) and the peripheral temperature (5°C) which should not be transgressed in an overwintering cluster. Microcalorimetric determinations of the heat production were performed on the three castes of the honey bee: workers, drones and queens of different ages. Among these groups single adult workers showed the highest heat production rates (209 mW·g-1) with only neglectible fluctuations in the heat production rate. Juvenile workers exhibited a mean heat production rate of 142 mW·g-1. The rate of heat production of adult workers is strongly dependent upon the number of bees together in a group. With more than 10 individuals weight-specific heat dissipation remains constant with increasing group sizes at a level approximately 1/17 that of an isolated bee. Differences are seen between the rates of virgin (117 mW·g-1) and laying (102 mW·g-1) queens. Laying queens showed less thermal fluctuations than virgin queens. High fluctuations in heat production rates are observed for drones. In both groups (fertile, juvenile) phases of high and extremely low activity succeed one another. The heat production of juvenile drones was 68 mW·g-1, that of fertile drones 184 mW·g-1 due to stronger locomotory activities. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.","Bees; Calorimetry; Heat production; Temperature; Thermoregulation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024845784

A non parametric approach is used to provide a general classification of the responses recorded in this study and to compare the response patterns of deutocerebral neurones belonging to different morphological categories. A more detailed analysis is used to investigate trends within and between populations of deutocerebral neurones grouped according to their morphological characteristics, or according to the type of stimulation applied to the animal. 2. None of the cells recorded in this study responded to simple visual stimulation (a light flash). However, many cells responded to one or more of the three forms of antennal stimulation used (a puff of rose scent, a puff of air and a puff of the alarm pheromone isoamylacetate) and certain neurones responded differently to each of these three forms of antennal stimulation. The most common response to all antennal stimuli was an increase in the frequency of action potentials recorded at the onset of the stimulus. Some variation in the response patterns of neurones innervating different regions of the antennal lobe was revealed. However, it was not possible to predict the morphology of deutocerebral neurones based upon their background frequency of action potentials, their response characteristics, or the latency of their responses. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001437903

The number of anal tubes and drops was high in winter and spring and declined to a trough in late summer and autumn. Drop quality (size and sugar concentration) also reached a low in the late summer and autumn. It is suggested that consumption of drops by wasps (mainly common wasps, Vespula vulgaris, but also German wasps, V. germanica) caused the paucity of honeydew in late summer and autumn. Wasps probably also prevented feral honey bees (Apis mellifera) from gathering honeydew then.Wasps were by far the most abundant insect feeding on honeydew, peaking at an average of 58 wasps per m2 of trunk of honeydew-infested tree in March.

Bees land, move about the inflorescences in search of nectar, and come to a last-faced position from which takeoff occurs. Last-faced directions are generated by a forward-moving tendency while probing artificial inflorescences or real florets. This tendency is modulated by restricted bee locomotion, caused by the size and shape of the visited inflorescence and the spatial distribution of florets within such inflorescences. The result is that bees tend to circle inflorescences. The process is terminated with an undefined stopping rule, whereupon bees usually depart in the direction they last face. The last-faced direction is a by-product of intrafloral search and becomes less associated with arrival directions as intrafloral search continues. Pollinator flight directionality is usually represented as a frequency distribution of angular changes in direction which typically has a mean near 0° and a variance that increases with increases in energy gain. We show that these characteristics are artifacts of pooling mirror-image movement data sets;a mean of 0° is the result of canceling the means of the left- and right-hand turns. The putative increased variance associated with energy gain is the result of adding the variances associated with left- and right-handed turns. These computational artifacts may be avoided by changing the sign of the left-handed turns prior to pooling with the right-handed turns (or vice versa). Pooling bee visits based only on the number of florets probed can destroy information relevant to studies examining behavioral mechanisms of flight directionality. Analytical problems encountered when turns exceed 360° are also addressed. © 1989 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","Apis Mellifera; artificial flower; Bombus Pennsylvanicus; directionality; flight; foraging; pollination; red clover; search",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0006442650

In a bioassay we tested trophallactic behavior of workers and selected dominant (receiving) and subordinate worker bees (offering) of Apis mellifera capensis to establish genetic lines of both kinds. Queenright test colonies were experimentally composed of 100% subordinate workers, 100% dominant workers, 50% dominant plus 50% subordinate workers, and 100% hybrid workers from the two genetic lines. The chosen test parameters were brood-rearing, comb building and hoarding behavior. In all cases, the colonies of pure subordinate bees showed the best colony performance, whereas the colonies composed of only dominant bees were nearly unproductive. The mixed colonies (50% dominant + 50% subordinate) ranked in the middle and did not differ significantly from the hybrid colonies.

This blend, which consists of three acids: 9-keto-2 (E)-decenoic acid (9ODA), and R-(-)- and S-(+)-9-hydroxy-2 (E)-decenoic acid (9HDA), and two aromatics: methyl p-hydroxybenzoate (HOB) and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylethanol (HVA), has recently been shown to be significantly more active than any of its individual components, alone or in combinations of less than five components, in retinue formation around the queen (Slessoret al., 1988). In the current research, treatments included live queens, mandibular gland extracts, the three decenoic acids together, and the decenoic acids plus the aromatics HOB and HVA. While mandibular gland pheromones attracted workers during swarming and inhibited queen rearing, the queen always showed the strongest activity. However, the five-component blend was always equal to or better than the mandibular extract, suggesting that additional, non-mandibular pheromones may also be involved in these functions. The combination of the two aromatics, HOB and HVA, with the three decenoic acids, 9ODA, R-(-)-9HDA, and S-(+)-9HDA, showed stronger activity than the decenoic acids alone. The enhanced activity of the full, five-component blend exhibited a range of effects from a slight, qualitative enhancement of cluster formation to a moderate, quantitative enhancement of queen rearing inhibition, to a strong, highly significant enhancement of retinue formation. © 1989 Masson.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000077394

One manifestation of this in the context of foraging is a colony's ability to adjust its selectivity among nectar sources in relation to its nutritional status. When a colony's food situation is good, it exploits only highly profitable patches of flowers, but when its situation is poor, a colony's foragers will exploit both highly profitable and less profitable flower patches. The nectar foragers in a colony acquire information about their colony's nutritional status by noting the difficulty of finding food storer bees to receive their nectar, rather than by evaluating directly the variables determining their colony's food situation: rate of nectar intake and amount of empty storage comb. (The food storer bees in a colony are the bees that collect nectar from returning foragers and store it in the honey combs. They are the age group (generally 12-18 day old bees) that is older than the nurse bees but younger than the foragers. Food storers make up approximately 20% of a colony members.) The mathematical theory for the behavior of queues indicates that the waiting time experienced by nectar foragers before unloading to food storers (queue length) is a reliable and sensitive indicator of a colony's nutritional status. Queue length is automatically determined by the ratio of two rates which are directly related to a colony's nutritional condition: the rate of arrival of loaded nectar foragers at the hive (arrival rate) and the rate of arrival of empty food storers at the nectar delivery area (service rate). These two rates are a function of the colony's nectar intake rate and its empty comb area, respectively. Although waiting time conveys crucial information about the colony's nutritional status, it has not been molded by natural selection to serve this purpose. Unlike ""signals"", which are evolved specifically to convey information, this ""cue"" conveys information as an automatic by-product. Such cues may prove more important than signals in colony integration. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024903844

When its value equals 1, this means that the 'apparent' inhibitions and synergies can be expressed only through the power law exponents of the components. This, of course, holds true when a substance is added to itself. Values less than or greater than 1 are interpreted as 'true' inhibition and synergy respectively. In a slightly modified definition, this index [called Γ (Gamma)] has been applied to two sets of data, (i) By using an appropriate computer program, theoretical iso-intensity curves for binary mixtures were generated by given values of this index, the variables being the concentrations. The diversity of curves is comparable to that observed in certain psychophysical studies (Köster, 1969).

Racial admixture was calculated from information obtained for Mdh in Africa and Europe. The percentages of racial admixture differed slightly but significantly among Brazilian regions. The greater proportions of Apis mellifera adansonii alleles in the admixture may be explained by selection during the initial stage of migration of Africanized bees and by preferential mating between individuals of the same race. Differences in the proportions of A. m. adansonii alleles between regions indicate incipient populational differentiation of Africanized bees.

Electromyogram quantification allows for more accurate description of the graded nature of the response and demonstrates the usefulness of electromyogram recordings in the quantification of behaviour. Results show that, after an equivalent amount of conditioning, bees respond more strongly to some conditioned odourants than to others. Although responses occur to novel odourants, they depend on the combination of conditioned odourant and the novel odourant presented. Furthermore, generalization to novel odourants within the same chemical class as the conditioned odourants is usually, but not always, stronger than generalization to odourants of different classes. © 1989.","Apis mellifera; Electromyograms; honey bees; odourant generalization; proboscis extension conditioning",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249023331

The electrophoretic method allows octapeptides to be resolved and species as small as decapeptides can be detected at high sensitivity using the Coomassie blue staining method without prior fixation. This has been achieved by replacing acetic acid by propionic acid in acid/urea polyacrylamide gels and by controlling the amount of TEMED catalyst for the polymerisation of high concentration gels in order to obtain a low effective pore size. We demonstrated the value of ethanol precipitation as a rapid and efficient desalting the fractionation technique and propose that it could be used in combination with gel filtration to purify many of the peptides to homogeneity. © 1989.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024354054

As reproduction rates of Varroa are quite low, a reduction of the more sensitive immature stages will suffice as a treatment method. A possible pathway of systemic application within cells by feeding pollen was demonstrated. Honey bees transfer acaricides taken up with the pollen to larva by feeding glandular brood food secretions. This pathway was demonstrated using methylene blue. Clofentezin (Apollo, Schering AG) was applied to cells before sealing and was shown to prevent the reproduction of Varroa if more than 2.5 μg clofentezin were applied per cell. Apparently, this effect was due to interfering with the nymphal development of Varroa. Higher dosages caused death of adult Varroa also. With amounts higher than 5 μg, increasing proportions of the bee pupae showed deformations from incomplete moulding. Clofentezin mixed with pollen was fed to nucleus colonies with similar effects as above on Varroa and bees. As the interval between toxic effects on Varroa offspring and bee pupae is quite narrow, this substance itself is not appropriate for practical application. However, using this pathway with improved substances might open up a new application method of Varroa control. Blockierung der Reproduktion von Varroa jacobsoni Oud. durch Fütterung von Clofentezin in Pollen an den Wirt Apis mellifera L. Der Bienenparasit Varroa jacobsoni vermehrt sich innerhalb verdeckelter Brutzellen von A. mellifera und ist darin gegenüber den meisten Akariziden geschützt. Da die Reproduktionsrate von Varroa niedrig ist, könnte eine Reduzierung der empfindlicheren immaturen Stadien als Bekämpfungsmaßnahme ausreichen. Ein möglicher systematischer Applikationsweg in die Zellen hinein über die Verfütterung von Pollen wurde aufgezeigt. Honigbienen übertragen Akarizide aus dem aufgenommenen Pollen auf die Larven über den Futterdrüsensaft. Der Übertragungsweg wurde mit Methylenblau‐Anfärbung nachgewiesen. Clofentezin (Apollo, Schering AG) wurde kurz vor Verdeckelung in die Zellen eingebracht und verhinderte die Reproduktion der Milben in Dosierungen über 2,5 mg pro Zelle. Offensichtlich beruhte dies auf einer Beeinträchtigung der Nymphalentwicklung. In höheren Dosierungen wurden auch adulte Varroa abgetötet. Bei mehr als 5 mg Clofentezin pro Zelle zeigten steigende Anteile der Bienenpuppen auf Entwicklungsstörungen zurückzuführende Deformationen. Clofentezin, in Pollen gemischt und an Kleinvölker (Kirchhainer Begattungskästen) verfüttert, erzielte vergleichbare Wirkungen. Da der Spielraum zwischen Milbentoxizität und Bienentoxizität verhältnismäßig schmal ist, ist die Substanz selbst für eine praktische Anwendung nicht geeignet. Die Ausnutzung des hier beschriebenen Applikationsweges mit verbesserten Substanzen könnte aber eine neuartige Methodik der Varroabekämpfung darstellen. 1989 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1542656136

Each foraging group within the honeybee colony shows a high degree of fidelity to one species of flower. Across the day, the temporal accuracy of foraging visits to experimental feeding times varies considerably, being nearly exact for morning-trained foraging groups but becoming less so for foraging groups trained later in the day. The evidence gained in this study suggests that the diel change in accuracy exhibited by foraging groups, which persists after the removal of many potential environmental time cues, is an endogenously driven behavior pattern. Fur thermore, it appears that individual bees are continuously and accurately aware of the time of day, but are programmed to forage with greater anticipation to late-day food sources. Therefore, two separate processes contributing to the honeybee time sense are implicated. The first varies with time of day and determines the amount of anticipatory activity directed toward the food source. The second process is invariant across the day and is involved with the individual forager's continuous, accurate awareness of time. © 1989, Sage Publications.

This chordotonal organ may function as a proprioceptor for the movement of the galea. Another chordotonal organ exists in the prementum of the labium. It contains, on the average, 12 sensory cells and presumably responds to the bending of the labial palp. A nerve‐net of bipolar cells arises from the sensory branches of the maxillary nerve. Free nerve endings derived from the periphery of this nerve‐net expand broadly on the intersegmental membranes connected to the stipes.

Treatment with 1 g OTC, at the time of inoculation delayed the development of AFB disease signs in four hives for periods between 2 months and 1 year. One colony so treated did not contract the disease. Colonies with a light AFB infection treated with 1 g of OTC recovered from the disease in 3-4 weeks, but AFB disease signs reappeared in three of five colonies the following season. Colonies with a well-established infection showed complete recovery from AFB disease signs after various OTC treatments. However, nearly all of these colonies developed AFB disease signs in the following season.B. larvae was cultured from adult bee samples from colonies that were AFB disease-free at the time of sampling but subsequently developed disease signs, and from colonies that were AFB disease-free at the time of sampling but did not subsequently develop disease signs. The results show that recommended treatments for European foulbrood (EFB) effectively mask AFB disease, making it likely that beekeepers treating EFB also suppress signs of AFB disease if it is present. As it is common practice in Australia to treat EFB prophylactically with OTC, an escalation of AFB in Australian hives is anticipated. © 1989 CSIRO.

This honeybee subsequently escaped from captivity, hybridized with existing honeybee populations and has diffused over much of South America. This paper examines the impact of this diffusion in one South American country, Peru, comparing beekeeping practice and management techniques in the region infested with the aggressive hybrid and in the region free of the hybrid. The study reveals consistent differences between the two regions in almost all criteria examined. Beekeepers in the African region are characterized by the use of more modern equipment, better management techniques, and more successful and commercially orientated beekeeping operations. While the presence of the African honeybee has been bothersome to those Peruvian beekeepers with it in their apiaries, the bee has proved to be neither as damaging nor as disruptive as is frequently suggested. Indeed, Peruvian beekeepers have adapted to the bee's presence with comparative ease and with no organized assistance from public or private agencies. The results of this study suggest that the impact of the African bee's arrival in central and northern Mexico and in the southern United States will not be nearly as disruptive and severe as many people believe. © 1989.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024901982

The author focuses on the proximate mechanism by which colonies function as integrated wholes by examining the architecture of information flow. The key to this is studies of worker activities, viz the large amount of time spent in patrolling, in turn related to the gathering of information through cues (information carried only incidentally), signals (stimuli conveying information on food sources, etc) and the shared environment.

At a population of P. cordata at Pothole Lake, Ontario, the majority of flowers are visited by bumble bees which remove on average 45% of the pollen during single visits to previously unvisited flowers. The amount and proportion of pollen removed are significantly different among floral morphs and stamen levels. Deposition of the three pollen types on the bodies of Bombus spp., Apis mellifera and Melissodes apicata is non‐random: large‐ and medium‐size pollen tends to remain in greatest concentrations where it is initially deposited, whereas small‐size pollen is displaced from the proboscis to more posterior body parts, probably as a result of grooming activities. Stigmatic pollen loads of individual flowers following single bumble bee visits indicate that the mid‐styled morph captures the largest total pollen load, and the short‐styled morph the smallest. The largest proportion of compatible pollen grains is deposited on stigmas of the long‐styled morph.

Gap junctions and septate junctions are found between differentiating photoreceptor cells only as long as the rhabdoms are beginning to form. Their disappearance after differentiation indicates that they could play a part in cell determination. Desmosomes connect photoreceptor cells into the early imaginai stage and then disappear. Other junctions, once they have formed, remain for the life of the animal, but can change considerably in structure, distribution and frequency. The cells of the perineurium surrounding the ocellus are connected by septate and gap junctions, which may be the basis of the blood-eye barrier.

Worker-derived males are frequent in some species, but in others occur only in queenless colonies2,3. Workers are more related to their own sons (coefficient of 0.5) than to the queen's sons (their brothers; 0.25); they are also more related to nephews (0.375) than brothers if queens mate with one male, but if queens mate with more than two unrelated males a worker's mean rela tedness to nephews is less than to brothers3-5. In this case workers could benefit by 'worker policing'3,5: prevent-ing each other from producing males, perhaps by destroying worker-laid eggs or by aggression toward reproductive workers. Worker reproduction is rare in queenright colonies of species with multiply mated queens (such as honeybees6 and some yellowjacket wasps7), but is common in some monandrous species (bumblebees and stingless bees3). Here we describe experiments showing strong discrimination by honeybee (Apis mellifera) workers against worker-laid male eggs, supporting the worker-policing hypothesis. The honeybee was studied because queens mate with 10-20 males8, making worker policing seem likely as a cause for the rarity of worker-derived males (about one in a thousand males is worker-derived6). © 1989 Nature Publishing Group.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024929450

Variation in body size of workers may result in the communication of misinformation because some information acquired by the scout and signaled to recruits is affected by body size. I tested two predictions of this hypothesis. (1) Recruitment communication takes place between bees of similar size despite the withincolony size distribution. (2) There is an inverse relationship between the size variation of foraging honey bees (Apis mellifera)and the rate at which nectar is returned to the colony. A positive relationship was found between the size of a dancer and that of its dance followers, which together comprise a dance group. There was less variation in size within dance groups than among groups. These two factors effectively lower the difference in size between signal sender and signal receiver and may enhance the flow of accurate size-dependent information. Also, an inverse relationship between size variation and rate of nectar intake was detected in each of six colonies using partial correlation analysis. This may be due to communication of misinformation when size variance is higher. The relationship was statistically significant in two colonies and the combined results were significant. The results of the first study suggest the generally weak relationships found in this second study. © 1989 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","Apis mellifera; body-size variance; colony food intake; dance groups; foraging behavior; honey bee; recruitment",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002456348

The binding of the antiserum in paraffin serial sections was studied with the peroxidase‐antiperoxidase method. Dopamine‐like immunoreactive neurons are present in most parts of the brain and in the suboesophageal ganglion. Only the optic lobes are devoid of label. There are ca. 330 dopamine immunoreactive somata in each brain hemisphere plus respective suboesophageal hemiganglion, which is less than 0.1% of the entire neuronal population. Most of the labelled somata are situated within three clusters: one below the lateral calyx and two in the anterior‐ventral protocerebrum. Other labelled somata lie dispersed or in small groups around the protocerebral bridge, below the optic tubercles, proximal to the ventral rim of the lobula, and in the lateral and ventral somatal rind of the suboesophageal ganglion. Similar to neurons that react with an antiserum against serotonin, the fine processes of dopamine immunoreactive fibers have a varicose appearance which is typical for aminergic neurons. In addition to the neuronal staining, dopamine‐like immunoreactivity is also present in the sheath surrounding the brain and in the retina, where it is not restricted to any particular cell type. A detailed account is given for those neurons and groups of neurons that could be traced and reconstructed in some detail. A common feature of all dopamine immunoreactive fibers is that each fiber invades large volumes of neuropil, suggesting that dopamine is more important in mediating distant rather than local neural interactions.

The anti-projectin antibodies also stain synchronous muscle, but, surprisingly, the epitopes here are within the A-bands, not between the A- and Z-bands, as in flight muscle. Monoclonal antibodies Z(210):1-4 recognize a 210-kD protein that has not been previously shown to be a Z-band structural component. A fourth antigen, resolved as a doublet (~400/600 kD) on immunoblots of Drosophila fibrillar proteins, is detected by a cross reacting antibody, Z(400):2, raised against a protein in isolated honeybee Z-disks.

The AChE staining marked layers in the optic lobes, fibers connecting the two brain hemispheres, and fiber tracts as well as soma clusters within the protocerebrum. The calycal input regions of the mushroom bodies were labelled, whereas the intrinsic Kenyon cells showed no staining. Although the antennal afferents projecting into the dorsal lobe showed strong AChE activity, projections into the antennal lobe showed rather weak staining. Application of the antiserum against the AChR showed immunoreactivity in neuropiles, tracts, somata, and the antennal nerve. The immunoreactivity of the optic lobes coincided with the banding pattern of the AChE staining. A particularly striking overlap of AChR immunoreactivity and AChE staining was found in the lip neuropile of the mushroom bodies, which would suggest a cholinergic input into this neuropile via fibers of the median antennoglomerular tract. Because the antiserum against locust AChR binds in neuropiles displaying AChE activity, we conclude that this antiserum also cross‐reacts with the bee's receptor. This interpretation is supported by experiments showing α‐bungarotoxin (α‐BTX) binding sites in some areas of strong immunoreactivity. Copyright © 1989 Alan R.

They also show altered behavior if exposed while in contact with a conductive substrate. Measurements indicate that approximately 240 nA is coupled to a bee standing on a conductive substrate in a 100‐kV/m E field. In lab experiments, bee disturbance and sting result from exposure to E field >200 kV/m (bee current >480 nA) and reduced voluntary movements at >300 kV/m (>720 nA bee current) only if the bee is on a conductive substrate. It is hypothesized that in the latter situation coupled bee current drains through the lower thorax and legs to the conductive substrate, and that the resulting enhanced current density in these regions is the cause of observed responses. The observation that bees exposed to intense E fields on an insulator show vibration of body parts but no behavioral response suggests that vibration contributes little to the disturbance of bees in intense E fields. Lab measurements of bee impedance from front‐to‐rear leg pairs were made on wet and dry conductors. Measurements validate the selection of 1 MΩ as a middle value for bee impedance used in the design of devices used to generate step‐potential‐induced currents in bees.

It rests on periodic processes which have the characteristics of self-sustaining oscillations, and which, in constant conditions, free-run with periods slightly deviating from 24 h. When entrained to 24 h, these circadian rhythms can be used by the organism as a clock for temporal orientation, e.g. in the occupation of one of the temporal niches provided by the environment or in the coordination of activities among individuals and species. The circadian clock also provides the basis for using the sun as a compass in spatial orientation, and for the recognition of the time of day as exemplified by the time sense in honey bees. Within the human organism, almost every function is modulated in a circadian fashion. Usually, all rhythms keep a distinct phase-relationship t to each other, providing a high degree of temporal order within the organism. When living in an isolation unit without time cues, most subjects develop free-running rhythms with periods close to 25 h in all functions. Sometimes, however, the sleep-wake cycle is lengthened to 30 h and more, or shortened to less than 22 h. In those instances, other rhythms such as that of body temperature become uncoupled from the sleep-wake cycle and continue to free-run with a period of about 25 h. During such states of 'internal desynchronization', subjects can be awake continuously for about 32 h, and sleep without interruption for 16 h. Nevertheless, they experience their 'days' as equal to 24 h. This is due to a profound change in time estimation: the intervals of 1-h estimates made by the subject are positively correlated with the duration of wakefulness. In contrast, short-time estimates (in the range of seconds) remain unaffected by desynchronization, indicating that short- and long-time estimates are based on different mechanisms. © 1989.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024874488

Statistical characterization of behavior must involve observation of the behavior under different stimulus conditions, which includes how stimuli associated with behavioral releasers come to trigger behavior during learning. For example, the feeding motor program (FMP) of the honey bee Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) during proboscis extension can be divided into three response phases (Rehder 1987). We conditioned honey bees in an olfactory conditioning paradigm with one or several rewarded trials during which an odorant was paired with the sugar‐water unconditioned stimulus (US); the latter elicits proboscis extension and feeding in properly motivated bees. By recording electromyogram activity from one of the muscles that move the proboscis during feeding, we quantified the bees' responses during an unrewarded test with either the conditioned odorant, a different (novel) odorant, or the sugar‐water US. Various parameters of the response phases of the FMP varied in a consistent manner across these experimental treatments, with certain stimuli eliciting stronger, more consistent responses. The different response phases followed one another in time with some variability and statistical uncertainty. For example, the length of an individual licking movement with the glossa was relatively invariant, and may indicate that this parameter can be used to differentiate the FMP into more basic, independent units. Our work shows how learned information may release action patterns in ways slightly different from traditional sign‐stimuli releasers. 1989 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990813057

Sensory neurons from the mandibles and labium were examined and their projection areas were related to those of the motoneurons. Motoneurons are located in the ventral part of the suboesophageal ganglion, have their somata in the hemiganglion ipsilateral to the filled nerve, and send prominent branches through identified ventral commissures into the contralateral hemiganglion. Motoneurons to the same muscle have parallel‐running projections into the contralateral hemiganglion, often parallel‐running neurites, and show vast areas of dendritic overlap. Arborizations of motoneurons are not restricted to their neuromere of origin but invade adjacent neuromeres, resulting in regions of dendritic overlap of motoneurons to different muscles. Sensory fibers from the mouthparts terminate in medio‐ and mediolateral parts of the suboesophageal ganglion, where their arborizations overlap with projections from motoneurons. A few sensory fibers descend in ventral parts of the cervical connective. Although sensory neurons from the mandible are restricted to the ipsilateral hemiganglion, those of the labium also show contralateral branches.

Large ocellar interneurons which terminate within the brain (LB neurons) were recorded from intracellularly and were identified visually after dye injection. Absolute sensitivity of LB neurons to light flashes ranges from 4 × 109 quanta/cm2s (Q) for MOC1,7 neurons to 1 × 1012 Q for MOC3,4. The slope of the response‐intensity (R/I) functions, which were calculated for intensities between 2 × 109 and 4 × 1013 Q, varies in different types of LB neurons. The strongest response is given by one group of median ocellar neurons. With constant light around 1013 Q, most LB neurons exhibit oscillatory hyperpolarizations which, upon increasing the stimulus to even higher intensities (1014–1015 Q), gradually evolve to a hyperpolarized plateau. The frequency of these oscillatory voltage fluctuations increases with the rate of modulation of the stimulating light and reaches maximum values at 5–15 Hz modulation frequency.

Quantitative predictions implied by this explanation are derived by incorporating it into a mathematical model of drone production in nonswarming honeybee colonies in temperate zones. The predictions are shown to be in close agreement with observational data from colonies in western Europe and North America, which have radically different drone-production patterns.

Proton spin-lattice relaxation times in the laboratory and rotating frames, as well as the proton spin-spin relaxation time, have been measured as a function of temperature (333 K&gt;T&gt;110 K). The liquid content of the wax has also been determined as a function of temperature by employing a simple pulse technique. The motional parameters associated with the reorientations of the methyl groups and the chains have been isolated and compared with these parameters for similar motions in Fischer-Tropsch waxes. The T1 ρ results revealed a minimum which is associated with the dangling motion of chain ends in the amorphous zone of the wax. The relaxation results strongly suggest that beeswax is branched to a much higher degree than Fischer-Tropsch waxes, including oxidised waxes. The high-resolution 13C spectrum of beeswax in the solid state shows that it resembles oxidised Fischer-Tropsch hard wax closely. The major difference is that a higher percentage of carbon atoms are involved in ester groups in beeswax. Oxidised hard wax contains a higher fraction of carbon atoms with double carbon-carbon bonds.

Staphylinids removed substantial amounts of pollen but did not deposit any onto stigmata. Abundance of beetles on inflorescences was related to the mean number of florets opening per day. Honey bees collecting pollen were more likely to effect pollination than those collecting nectar which only contacted stigmata when arriving or leaving an inflorescence. Nectar-foraging birds probed between florets 10.2±0.8 (±SE) times, contacting 8-16 stigmata during each probe. Bees visited inflorescences ten times more frequently than birds although they deposited only 25% of the pollen that birds did on stigmata. Fruit set was ten times greater on inflorescences visited by birds than on inflorescences visited by bees. Bees were capable of removing as much pollen as birds but, because of direct pollen transfer to birds when florets opened during foraging, actual removal was probably much less.

Venom protein release and alarm pheromone production by African worker honey-bees (Apis mellifera scutellata) were documented with respect to adult age. Behavioural assays were used to explore relationships among venom protein release, the alarm pheromone bouquets and the recruitability of bees to colony defence as a function of age. 2. The concentration of venom protein released by young worker honeybees is low (10-30 μg/bee), gradually increasing with age, reaching a plateau of 60 μg/bee at 17 days and remaining at this value in older bees. 3. Nine alarm pheromones from the sting were identified and analysed gas chromatographically. Of these, only isopentyl acetate, isopentyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol and n-hexyl acetate showed concentration profiles that clearly differed with age. The mandibular gland alarm pheromone 2-heptanone, had a reasonably well-defined concentration profile as related to age. 4. Behavioural assays showed: (1) more bees of all ages responded to an isolated sting (sting alarm pheromones) than to (2) an isolated pair of mandibular glands (2-heptanone). A response equivalent to (1) occurred when both a sting and a pair of mandibular glands were presented together. Older bees (15-25 days old) responded more readily to the donor stings, mandibular glands and stings and mandibular glands together of 15-25 day old bees than did younger bees. The responses of older bees (25 days old) were more rapid and of longer duration than of younger bees. 5. Our combined data on the production of venom protein, alarm signals and their efficacy in recruitment; and the latency and duration of worker responses can be correlated with age.

By means of real-time tele-thermography, contactless body surface temperature measurements of undisturbed animals were made. The foraging bees showed highly developed individual thermoregulatory abilities. Complex behavioral patterns such as food uptake, active body temperature regulation, and preparation for flight were performed simultaneously. However, body temperature was more variable than expected. When bees drank 0.5 M sucrose solution, they generally had a higher thoracic surface temperature (TThs) and showed smaller temperature fluctuations (e.g., cooling down after landing) than with 0.25 M solution. Given 0.5 M sucrose they stayed for shorter periods at the feeding place. The highest (maximum)TThs during the stop was positively (linearly) correlated with the ambient temperature (Ta=18-30°C) for both 0.25 M and 0.5 M sucrose feeding. At a Ta of 19°C the mean (interpolated) maximum values for TThs were 37.2°C (0.25 M) and 38.5°C (0.5 M); at a Ta of 27°C they were 39.2°C (0.25 M) and 40.9°C (0.5 M). The minimum TThs was correlated with Ta only with 0.5 M feeding, whereas with 0.25 M feeding a great variability was observed. Similarly as the maximum TThs, TThs upon landing and taking off were positively (linearly) correlated with Ta and were higher during 0.5 M feeding. The quality (concentration) of the food offered to the bees obviously influenced their thermal behavior at the feeding place. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001038606

Good hygienic behavior, defined as uncapping and removal of freeze-killed sealed brood by worker bees, was correlated with resistance to the disease in most of the test colonies. Resistant colonies had fewer hive substrates contaminated with the pathogen than susceptible colonies. Most bee bread (stored pollen) samples from susceptible colonies contained the pathogen, but few from resistant colonies did. Bee bread and guts of nurse bees were the major sources of the pathogen in susceptible colonies. A higher percentage of bee bread samples from resistant colonies contained yeasts and molds other than A. apis. Tests of bees, brood, bee bread, and honey for antimycotic substances active against A. apis revealed that microorganisms, primarily molds, produced inhibitory substances. Most of these organisms were isolated from bee bread. The largest zones of inhibition were produced by Rhizopus sp. and unidentified Mucorales.

Immunohistochemical demonstration of 5-HT-like immunoreactivity within the venom reservoir supports this finding. Measurements were made on bees of known age at various times during the summer season. The amount of 5-HT in the venom system varies with the age of the bee and with the time of year at which the bees reached a specific age. 5-HT is shown to be a component of pure venom, rather than simply present in venom gland and reservoir tissues, by its presence in venom collected by electrical 'milking' of worker bees. © 1988.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023884667

Buffers containing the non-ionic detergent Lubrol-PX were more efficient for solubilizing the enzyme and exhibited little inactivation effect when compared with Triton X-100-containing buffers. The acetylthiocholine-splitting activity was shown to be that of true AChE on the basis of inhibitor sensitivity and substrate inhibition. The enzyme from Lubrol-containing and detergent-free extracts had an optimum pH for activity of 9 and 8.7, respectively. The optimum temperature for activity was 45°C. The Arrhenius plot showed that the enzyme has an activation energy of 26 ± 0.8 kJ mol-1. Bee head AChE was susceptible to the presence of divalent cations but monovalent cations such as Na+ and K+ did not induce any inhibitory effect at concentrations up to 1 M. By contrast, they exhibited an activation effect with a maximum at 0.2 M. Histochemical localization for AChE on frozen sections of honeybees confirmed its specificity as true AChE by the use of specific inhibitors such as iso-OMPA, BW284C51 and eserine. The main AChE activity was located in the neuropil appearing as diffused or clumped dots. An AChE activity coating nuclei of neurones and glial cells in the vicinity of the neuropile was detected with Koelle's reaction. Such a distribution suggests different sites for synthesis, storage, transit and secretion for AChE in the brain. © 1988.","acetylcholinesterase; bee; insect; solubilization",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344694443

In colonies with low mite populations the viruses present and their incidence during the year were similar to the results obtained from British colonies. However, in marked contrast with findings in Britain, acute paralysis virus (APV) was the primary cause of adult bee mortality in German honey bee colonies severely infested with V. jacobsoni. Dead brood from unsealed and sealed infested cells from German colonies with high mite populations also contained much APV. The evidence suggests that V. jacobsoni activates APV replication in adult bees by its feeding behaviour and transmits virus from adult honey bees to pupae. In addition, adult bees, in which APV is multiplying, transmit the virus to unsealed brood in the larval food. Copyright © 1988, Wiley Blackwell.

The 5 S/6 S form aggregated upon removal of the detergent when sedimented on detergent-free gradients and was recovered in the detergent phase after Triton X-114 phase separation. Thus the 5 S/6 S enzyme corresponds to an amphiphilic acetylcholinesterase form.

Sedimentation analyses on detergent-containing gradients showed only a 5 S peak in high-salt detergent-free extracts and a 6 S peak, with a shoulder at about 7 S, in low-salt detergent-free extracts. Electrophoretic analysis in the presence of detergent demonstrated that the 14 S and 11 S peaks corresponded to aggregates of the 5 S/6 S form, whereas the 7 S peak corresponded to a hydrophilic acetylcholinesterase form which was recovered in the aqueous phase following Triton X-114 phase separation.

Though extracts of the tergal glands showed the same phenomenon, head extracts of closely related queens had no significantly reduced variabilities compared to extracts of unrelated queens. Workers, tested in a metabolic bioassay, could not discriminate among head extracts of related and unrelated queens. Therefore the classical queen substance and the semiochemicals of the mandibular glands are unlikely to be used as kin recognition labels by the workers. Workers could, however, discriminate among the odours of tergite extracts and the volatile signals of queens, indicating that the signal of the tergal gland secretions is a possible source for kin recognition labels which the mandibular gland secretions are not.

Based on the definitions for individual genetic relationship, several new measurements of group relatedness are derived and their genetical meaning is discussed. In a metabolic bioassay for the documentation of kin discrimination, carbon dioxide production was used to quantify reactions of groups of honey bees to volatile odours of other groups. Worker test groups, which had not experienced their hive environment, were able to discriminate between related and unrelated groups of workers within and between colonies. Test groups responded in a similar way to odours of genotypically mixed groups with related and unrelated workers and to the odours of pure groups of the less related subgroup. Thus, the reaction to group odours that function as discrimination labeles is not a linear response as predicted by an additive gestalt odour model. Since experienced bees collected from the colony could not discriminate between the various patrilines, the observed phenomenon resembles nest mate recognition rather than within-colony kin recognition. © 1988.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0342376208

Proposed mechanisms fell into two categories: direct bee perception of enhanced in‐hive E fields and perception of shock from induced currents. The adverse biological effects could be reproduced in simulations where only the worker bees were exposed to shock or to E field in elongated hive entranceways (=tunnels). We now report the results of full‐scale experiments using the tunnel exposure scheme, which assesses the contribution of shock and intense E field to colony disturbance. Exposure of worker bees (1,400 h) to 60‐Hz E fields including 100 kV/m under moisture‐free conditions within a nonconductive tunnel causes no deleterious affect on colony behavior. Exposure of bees in conductive (e.g., wet) tunnels produces bee disturbance, increased mortality, abnormal propolization, and possible impairment of colony growth. We propose that this substrate dependence of bee disturbance is the result of perception of shock from coupled body currents and enhanced current densities postulated to exist in the legs and thorax of bees on conductors. Similarly, disturbance occurs when bees are exposed to step‐potential‐induced currents. At 275–350 nA single bees are disturbed; at 600 nA bees begin abnormal propolization behavior; and stinging occurs at 900 nA. We conclude that biological effects seen in bee colonies under a transmission line are primarily the result of electric shock from induced hive currents. This evaluation is based on the limited effects of E‐field exposure in tunnels, the observed disturbance thresholds caused by shocks in tunnels, and the ability of hives exposed under a transmission line to source currents 100–1,000 times the shock thresholds.

Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.","When queens of eusocial Hymenoptera mate ≤2 times (assuming equal sperm contributions from males and random sperm use), the workers are more closely related to the queen's sons than to the sons of a randomly chosen worker. This suggests that workers should try to prevent other workers from reproducing, and hence producing sons, in species with queens that mate ≤2 times. It also provides a possible reason for the absence of reproductive workers in many hymenopteran societies. Reproductive harmony may therefore result from lowered relatedness among workers. The necessary behaviors and discriminatory ability to favor queen-produced over worker-produced males are referred to as ""worker policing'. Population-genetics simulations of the fate of a ""police allele', which confers any marginal increase in policing behavior to the workers carrying it, indicate that such an allele will invade and spread to fixation provided that queens mate two or more times. This conclusion is supported empirically by what is known about queen mating frequency and worker reproduction in the highly eusocial bees and wasps. Societies typically headed by monandrous queens, eg those of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris and stingless bees (Meliponinae), have reproductive workers in queenright colonies; those with polyandrous queens, as in honey bees Apis and some yellowjacket wasps Vespula, do not. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024252125

A possible genetic component to division of labour, however, has received little study9. Yet, the degree of genetic heterogeneity among workers within Hymenopteran colonies is often extremely high10, a consequence of multiple mating by the queen (polyandry11,12) and/or the presence of multiple laying t (J B ) queens (polygyny13).

Darwin's model for the evolution of these worker traits required: (1) heritable variation among workers within colonies; (2) variation in reproductive success among colonies due to different distributions of worker traits; and (3) changes in the distribution of worker traits within colonies due to colony-level selection. The role of genetics in this evolutionary process, unknown to Darwin, has still received little attention2,3. Calderone and Page4 recently demonstrated differences in the pollen-collecting behaviour of honey bees from two artificially selected strains5 co-fostered in wild-type colonies to be a consequence of genotypic differences between workers. These differences were caused by an artificial selection process analogous to that proposed by Darwin. Their study established a foundation for understanding genetic mechanisms underlying the evolution of division of labour but did not demonstrate a genetic basis for division of labour between related members of colonies, the essential element of the darwinian model.

For each step - dorsal strip invasion, gastrulation, formation of serosa, amnion and midgut - scanning electron microscopy reveals a highly specific syndrome of cell shapes and cell movements at the advancing epithelial edge. Epithelial translocation appears to result from various combinations of ameboid movement, cell flattening, cell rearrangement (intercalation) and cell contraction along the free epithelial edge. The direction of epithelial movements could result essentially from the initial shape and orientation of the edge combined with the cells' tendency to close vacant spaces by extension and migration.

Six species of bees were identified as pollinators, with alfalfa leafcutter bees comprising 56% of the observations, honey bees 40%, and bumble bees 4%. The density of flowers over the season can be described as curvilinear. The mean number of flowers per raceme decreased significantly over the season. The rate of foraging by pollinator species from flower to flower varied and is described by multiple regression models. Julian date, hour of day, and flower density are the independent variables. More than 90% of the bees visited three or fewer flowers per raceme when 60% of the racemes had three or more flowers available for pollination. The bees foraged on sainfoin for about 12 h per day and average bee density increased significantly with the corresponding flower density. A theoretical approach used to predict the bee populations required to pollinate varying flower densities shows that the required population of bumble bees is about two-thirds that of honey bees or alfalfa leafcutter bees. The observed populations of pollinators did not correspond well with the derived values, probably because multiple visits per flower are required for fertilization. © 1988, Entomological Society of Canada.

Taurine‐like immunoreactivity appeared within neuronal perikarya, neurites, and terminals, whereas glial cells were unlabelled. All photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes and the ocelli were stained. So were the fibers of the anterior superior optic tract, which connects the optic lobes to the mushroom bodies in the median protocerebrum. In the mushroom bodies the majority of intrinsic Kenyon cells showed high levels of taurine‐like immunoreactivity. The lateral antennoglomerular tract, which interconnects the mushroom bodies with the antennal lobes, was also intensely stained. In. the antennal lobes, strong labelling was observed within, a few fibers that invade a set of posterior glomeruli from the posterior margin. Sensory projections from the antennal nerve into the antennal lobes showed only intermediate levels of staining. Sensory projections into the dorsal lobe were devoid of taurine‐like immunoreactivity. Labral, mandibular, maxillary, and labial nerves, which innervate the various parts of the feeding apparatus, contain a set of five to eight heavily stained fibers. A comparison of taurine‐like immunoreactivity with glutamate‐ and GABA‐like immunoreactivities in the brain of the honeybee indicates that the three amino acids are enriched in distinct neuronal populations.

In the presence of resting tension, bridges were either perpendicular to the filament axis or tilted towards the M-line. In shortened, slack muscle, bridges remained perpendicular or were tilted towards the Z-line. Thus, the rigor bridge angle appears to depend on the state of the thick filament. With the thick filament under stress, the angle may be quite different than when it is slack. On the other hand, external force applied directly to the rigor bridges did not change their configuration. Bridge angle remained unchanged, irrespective of the amount of tension applied to the bridge.

A. Rich (Cucurbitaceae) were compared. The female flowers of E. elaterium resemble male flowers visually but are nectarless, and their number is relatively smaller. Apis mellifera was found to discriminate between the two genders and to pay relatively fewer visits to female flowers (mean of 30% relative to male flowers) from the beginning of their activity in the morning. The time spent by honeybees in female flowers is very short compared to that spent in male flowers. It is surmised that the bees remember the differences between the flowers where they foraged on the previous days. In contrast, the two species of solitary bees Lasioglossum politum (Morawitz) (Halictidae) and Ceratina mandibularis Fiese (Anthophoridae) visit the female flowers with nearly equal frequencies at the beginning of each foraging day and stay longer in these flowers. Over the day there is a decline in the relative frequency of visits to female flowers and also in the mean time spent in them. The study shows that bees can collect rewards at high efficiency from the flowers of Ecballium elaterium because of their partial discrimination ability and the scarcity of the mimic flowers. It is suggested that the memory pattern of some solitary bees may be different from that of Apis mellifera. It seems that the limited memory and discrimination ability of bees can lead to a high frequency of visits to the mimic flowers during a long flowering season. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.","Ecballium elaterium; Foraging behavior; Mimicrysolitary bees; Pollination",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023527565

Although nectar production is not different in the three floral morphs, differences in the production and size of pollen grains produced by the three anther levels results in the morphs offering variable amounts of resources to pollen-collecting insects. Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) and the solitary bee Melissodes apicata used P. cordata primarily as a nectar source and therefore did not seem to exhibit any morph preference. In contrast, honeybees visited flowers mainly for pollen and preferred to forage on long-level anthers of the short-and mid-styled morphs. An analysis of the composition of corbicular pollen loads indicated that, relative to the frequency of production in the population: 1) honeybees collected an excess of pollen from long-level anthers; 2) bumblebees collected the three types of pollen without any apparent preference; and 3) M. apicata preferentially collected pollen from the short-level anthers - presumably because their proboscides are modified by the presence of tiny hairs. The results suggest that P. cordata in Ontario is serviced by a diverse, unspecialized pollinator fauna which is not co-adapted to the tristylous floral polymorphism. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.","Behavior; Bombus; Pollination; Pontederia cordata; Tristyly",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023527227

The degree of phenotypic variation suggests that selection of honey bees for tracheal mite resistance is feasible. © 1987 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000789972

These experiments were performed on overcast days, and consisted of removing a hive from one site in which bees had been trained to find food by flying along a prominent landmark, and displacing it to a similar site in which the landmark was aligned in a different compass direction. On overcast days, bees which flew along the landmark in the new site oriented their waggle dances in the hive as if they had actually flown in the training site. Thus, they confused the two sets of landmarks and set their dance angles according to a memory of the sun's position relative to the original landmarks. Furthermore, the dances changed in correspondence with the sun's azimuthal shift over several hours, even reflecting (approximately) the regular temporal variations in the rate of shift; such features of the sun's course must therefore be stored in memory. The primary mechanism underlying the learning of this pattern is probably similar to that proposed by New and New (1962): bees store in memory several time-linked solar azimuthal positions relative to features of the landscape, and refer to this stored array when they need to determine an unknown azimuth intermediate between two known positions. During the cloudy-day displacement experiments, celestial cues often appeared to bees in the new site, contradicting the stored information on which they had been basing their dances. Although most bees quickly adopted the dance angle reflecting their actual direction of flight relative to the sun, some later reverted to the original dance angle, indicating that the information on which it was based had remained in memory when the new information was being expressed; other bees performed bimodal dances which expressed both sets of information in alternate waggle runs. The separation in memory implied by these behaviors may reflect a neural strategy for updating a previously stored relationship between celestial and terrestrial references with new information presented by seasonal changes in the sun's course or by newly learned landmarks. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250103992

This report compares the inhibition by manoalide of phospholipase A2 in crude cytosol fractions from four mammalian tissues with that of four purified extracellular phospholipase A2's. Phospholipase A2 isolated from bee venom (Apis mellifera) was the most sensitive to inactivation by manoalide (ic50 {reversed tilde equals} 0.12 μM). Extracellular phospholipase A2 from rattlesnake and cobra venom was intermediate in sensitivity to manoalide (ic50 values of 0.7 and 1.9 μM respectively). Porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2 was relatively resistant to inactivation by manoalide (ic50 {reversed tilde equals} 30 μM). The phospholipase A2 assayed in crude cytosol fractions from four mammalian tissues exhibited ic50 values of 30 μM or greater. Cytosolic proteins as well as bovine serum albumin and poly-L-lysine (Mr = 57,000) protected purified bee venom phospholipase A2 from inactivation by manoalide. In contrast, amino acids such as lysine and alanine failed to protect the purified enzyme from inactivation. Proteins and certain amino acids, such as lysine, formed a chromogenic product when incubated with manoalide. These data suggest that lysine is capable of reacting with manoalide, but only when it is present in macromolecules is it capable of protecting phospholipase A2 from inactivation by manoalide. Because cellular proteins protect PLA2 from inactivation by manoalide, high concentrations of manoalide must be applied topically to produce statistically significant inactivation of intracellular phospholipase A2. Finally, a chemical model is presented which explains the formation of a chromogenic product when manoalide is incubated with proteins and amino acids. © 1987.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023154142

Inoculation with 1 × 10-8 ng of purified virus was sufficient to cause infection in some pupae, and at doses of 1 × 10-5 ng every inoculated individual became infected (ID100). At completion of virus multiplication, between 200 and 500 μg of KBV could be recovered from each pupa. No significant relationship was found between final quantity of virus per pupa and inoculum size when the latter was greater than or equal to an ID100. Observation by electron microscopy showed that KBV multiplied in fore- and hindgut epithelial tissue, alimentary canal musculature, epidermis and tracheal epithelium, and in hemocytes, oenocytes, and tracheal end cells. Infected cells showed a marked pathological response which included condensation of chromatin, disruption of cytoplasmic organelles, and sloughing of lobules of cytoplasm. Virus multiplication apparently took place within cytoplasmic membrane-bound vesicles. The ultrastructure of these vesicles shows little similarity to those previously described for other small RNA viruses. No evidence of KBV multiplication was found in tissues of the nervous system, even though degeneration of glial cells was observed. Electron microscopy showed that the cytoplasm of affected glial cells contained large numbers of membrane-bound vacuoles. Coalescence of these vacuoles apparently caused a separation of the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells and was followed by the progressive degeneration of each. KBV infection caused significant changes in the hemolymph osmolality of infected pupae, but no discernible changes could be seen in pupal brain morphology following induction of identical osmolality levels by inoculation with concentrated salt solutions. © 1987.","Apis mellifera; glial cell degeneration; histopathology; Kashmir bee virus; small RNA virus",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249035312

Various pollen and nectar producing plants were grown in the cage, repeatedly sprayed and the behaviour of the bees and the development of their colonies observed. In two very small bee colonies, consisting of a queen and about 200–300 workers, some damage was observed as a number of young bees were unable to hatch from the cells after biting off the lids. A few bees showed crippled wings and parts of the pupal exuvia adhering to the abdomen. In bigger, but still rather small colonies of ca. 3000 workers, no damage occurred. Foraging bees were not repelled from treated flowers and did not show any signs of damage or atypical behaviour. Under field conditions serious damage to bees by neem products seems to be unlikely. However, they are not completely safe to bees and to exclude any risk it should be avoided to spray higher concentrations of neem extracts on flowers which are attended by numerous honey bees.

The effects of colony size and time of reproduction on the survival and size of offspring colonies and on drone production were examined for honey bees, Apis mellifera L. Drone and worker production and survival of parental and offspring colonies were monitored following swarming. Also, the temporal patterns of drone emergence and availability of unmated queens were examined. 2. Colony size at swarming was positively correlated with the number of workers invested in offspring colonies and the number of queens produced. However, colony size at swarming was not correlated with the number of offspring colonies produced. 3. Swarm size was positively correlated with drone and worker production after swarms were hived. Worker production of hived swarms was positively correlated with colony survival. Offspring queens which inherited a parental nest survived longer than queens in either primary swarms or afterswarms, presumably due to the advantage of inheriting a nest. 4. Drone emergence peaked just prior to swarming, the time when unmated queens were available. High drone production by colonies initiated by swarms probably reflected an attempt to reproduce prior to winter. The probabilities of a second swarming cycle within the same year and of surviving the winter were low for colonies initiated from swarms. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell.

On the other hand, the shortening of the photoperiod led to a winter-bee-like increase of the lipid and protein content of the fat body. However, the ‘short-day’ treatment was not enough to trigger the development of long-living winter bees. © 1987 International Bee Research Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0004546433

One set of workers was reared in non-maternal colonies which had been made uniform, as far as possible, with respect to colony strength (number of workers), while another set was sampled directly from the combs of each maternal colony. Combining ability analysis of variance revealed significant additive and non-additive genetic effects for both sets of data, regardless of whether inbred parentals were included or excluded from the analysis. Uniform rearing removed average heterosis and reciprocal effects. The results demonstrate that there was both additive and, somewhat surprisingly, non-additive genetic variation in this haplo-diploid species, among the lines studied. A complex interaction between colony strength and hamuli number was evident from the fact that average heterosis was eliminated by uniform rearing, which removed the effect of variation in colony strength between inbred and hybrid colonies. © 1987 ASEG.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0040177538

Among the 4 species of honey bee and among the races of Apis mellifera, many differences in the dance appear to have adaptive value, casting light on the later evolution of the dance. The roles of sound versus vision in the dances appear related to nesting ecology; the imprecision in distance and direction indication appears to be 'tuned' to an optimal patch size; and various distance dialects appear to be consequences of winter stress.-from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023467669

Colonies of the South African honeybee race Apis mellifera capensis (Escholtz) were maintained under constant conditions of illumination (200 lux), temperature (25±ld̀C) and relative humidity (65±3%). Activity was measured at the hive entrance. After ad libitum feeding for at least 5 days, food was presented for only 2 h/day either for 1 week (series 1) or for 2 weeks (series 2). In the last part of each experiment, food was again available all the time. Colonies which showed free‐running circadian activity rhythms (with periods ranging from 22.6 to 24.8 h) during ad libitum feeding were submitted to feeding cycles with inter‐feeding intervals (T) of 22, 23, 24 and 25 h. In most of these experiments the rhythms were synchronized by the feeding schedule, resulting in a stable phase‐angle difference between onset of activity and onset of food availability. The duration of this anticipatory activity was positively correlated with T. When ad libitum feeding was resumed, the period of the rhythm induced by the feeding schedule persisted for a few days. Thereafter, the rhythm was free‐running again with a period close to that observed in the first part of the experiment. The conclusion is drawn that, under the influence of periodic feeding, the activity of honeybee colonies has the characteristics of an entrained circadian system. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell.

Intraspecific isolation also had an effect: isolated patches received relatively few visits. Visitation rate depended both on visitor abundance and on the proportion of flowers entered during one visit. All three visitor types were more abundant in larger patches, ie flowers showed mutual attraction of pollinators. Relative to a visit to a small patch, during a visit to a large patch, honey bees visited more flowers but a lower proportion of flowers; solitary bees visited fewer flowers and thus a lower proportion of flowers; and bumble bees visited not only more flowers but a higher proportion of flowers as well.

Each of these xerophytic, shrubby perennials co-occurs with a widespread congener: A. linifolius with A. lonchocarpus and A. osterhouti with A. pattersoni. All four species exhibit similar floral size, colour and morphology and reproduce primarily by insect-mediated cross-pollination. These similarities facilitate comparisons of pollinator visitation to the restricted and widespread congeners. The most frequent visitors to the four species are polylectic bees (Bombus spp., Osmia spp., Anthopora spp. and Apis mellifera). Individuals of rare A. linifolius receive significantly lower levels of pollinator visitation than do plants of widespread A. lonchocarpus. The restricted species' poor success in competition for pollinators may have contributed to, and probably helps to maintain, their rarity. Plants of both geographically restricted species may be particularly susceptible to types of human disturbance that would further reduce the frequency of pollinator visitations: pesticide spraying and overgrazing.

Patterns of nectar foraging were distinctly different in the two geographical types. Among Africanized honeybees, lower proportions of the foraging force were engaged in foraging for nectar only, but a higher proportion foraged for both nectar and pollen. In addition, Africanized bees collected lower volumes per foraging trip than European honeybees, but returned to the colony with nectars having a higher sugar content. The two geographical types contributed similar amounts of joules (energy) per average forager and, therefore, made similar net contributions of carbohydrate energy to the colony. However, European colonies always had more stored honey than Africanized colonies. The observed differences in foraging patterns could not account for all of the measured difference in stored honey; several testable hypotheses are presented to explain this. © 1987 International Bee Research Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0009786508

The impact of this intra-colony genetic variation on social grooming and trophallaxis (liquid food exchange) among workers in colonies consisting of two phenotypically-distinct worker patrilines was examined. Workers in these colonies groomed and fed a disproportionately large number of full sisters despite a tendency to encounter a disproportionately large number of half-sisters. Thus, workers actively discriminated between full and half-sisters. This patrilineal discrimination occurred both in colonies with laying queens and in a queenless colony rearing replacement queens.

The amount of labelled phenylalanine in royal jelly was associated directly with the volume of jelly produced. Loss of radio‐label from the workers, in the form of O214C, increased when royal jelly secretion ended. These patterns show that conservation of nutrients in cannibalized tissue is enhanced when the cannibal bees are producing royal jelly.

Although each of the inhibitors, 25‐azacoprostane, 25‐azacholestane, or N,N‐dimethyldodecanamine, has been shown to severely inhibit steroid metabolism and larval development in a number of species of omnivorous and phytophagous insects, none of them affected honey bee brood development to the adult stage.

Each of the ecdysteroid analogs, 22,25‐dideoxyecdysone or 2,22,25‐trideoxy‐5β‐hydroxyecdysone, severely suppressed larval development when fed in the chemically defined diet. This effect apparently results from the presence of the dietary ecdysteroid or its metabolite in the brood food placed in the larval cells or the inability of the worker bees fed the ecdysteroid to include some essential factor in the brood food.

The reproducibility of various extraction methods was investigated. Emphasis was placed on the quantitative assessment of changes in the gas chromatographic profiles. Soxhlet extraction with toluene produced slightly larger amounts of high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons than washings with n-hexane. Differences between freeze dried, air dried, and fresh specimen were minimal. The hydrocarbon content of bees, stored at ambient temperature decreased with time but the patterns did not change significantly. A reproducibility study showed that differences in the chromatographic profiles of bees from the same colony were small. Bees collected over a wide geographic area produced larger variations. Bees from the European and African subspecies and their hybrid, the so-called Africanized bee, produced very characteristic profiles. The data were subjected to computerized pattern recognition, based on the chemometrics package ARTHUR. The three subspecies examined were the European honeybee, the African honeybee and an Africanized hybrid originating from Panama. The subspecies can easily be distinguished from each other by their characteristic chromatographic profiles. Only three components are needed to carry out reliable classification. It was found that the K-nearest neighbor algorithm provides the best classification potential. © 1987.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-45949116310

Species flowering locally in abundance were preferred, but some common species were never visited. L. conosiephioides was a major source of pollen early in the two study seasons (1981 and 1982), followed later in the season by L. striatus (1981 only) and A. stenoptera (1982 only).

All brood combs were removed from six infested colonies, and worker bees and mites from these combs brushed on to one uninfected brood comb which was then placed in each colony. Ten and eleven days later, the age of brood infested by mites was determined; thus the length of the mites’ stay outside the sealed brood cells could be directly established. The ratio of number of workers to number of brood infested by T. clareae was one-tenth of that for V. jacobsoni indicating that T. clareae mites remained outside sealed brood cells for only about one-tenth as long as V. jacobsoni or around 1·3 days compared with 13 days. Eighty % of cells infested by T. clareae were sealed within two to three days after the new comb was introduced, whereas 80% of cells infested by V. jacobsoni were sealed within eight days, supporting the conclusion that T. clareae remained outside sealed brood cells for a much shorter time than V. jacobsoni. Chlorobenzilate killed T. clareae and V. jacobsoni mites to the same extent. The lack of success in earlier studies in controlling T. clareae by drugs in the presence of brood was not due to the mite·s resistance, but rather to the short period of activity of the drugs and failure to use proper intervals between successive treatments. Effective control of T. clareae in honeybee colonies with brood could be obtained with drugs of prolonged continuous activity which would kill successively emerging mites during their short stay outside sealed brood cells. However, control of T. clareae without medication, by depriving colonies of all brood, is recommended. © 1987 International Bee Research Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84953075540

The rate of infestation by Varroa jacobsoni was low in both parts of Vietnam. The ratios of brood: worker infestation by T. clareae ranged from 13·5–16·0 in Afghanistan and southern Vietnam and 26·1–36·9 in northern Vietnam. The corresponding ratios for V. jacobsoni were 0·8 in southern Vietnam and 2·9–8·2 in the north. These data suggest that in the colder areas V. jacobsoni mites remain outside sealed brood for a shorter time, resulting in a more rapid population increase there. Some measures of population for T. clareae mites in honeybee colonies with low (26%) and high (72%) rates of infestation were as follows: 1·3 and 2·3 females were found on average per brood cell, 18 and 7·3% of females were infertile, one female produced an average of 1·3 and 1·9 descendants, and the mean overall numbers of mites per brood cell were 2·9 and 5·1. The population of T. clareae increases at a geometrically greater rate than that of V. jacobsoni, owing mainly to the fact that mites of the former species remain outside sealed brood cells for only a small fraction of the time spent outside by the latter. The ratio of males to females for all T. clareae mites, old and young, present in brood cells was 1:4. On the average one old female produced 0·6 males and 1·4 females. In the offspring the ratio of males to females was 1: 2·3. The mean infestation rate of drone brood by V. jacobsoni was 5·1 limes that of worker brood, whereas for T. clareae the rate was 1·5 times as great for worker brood.

The aim of this study was to characterize quantitatively the ontogeny and individual variability of guarding behaviour, the allocation of workers to the guard population in a colony, and the intercolonial variability of guarding behaviour. Guarding is a discrete task performed by a distinct group of workers that are younger than foragers and older than house bees. Workers that guarded initiated the behaviour between the ages of 7 and 22 days. The mean age of the onset of guarding varied; the minimum mean age of guards for a colony was 13·6 days and the maximum was 16·0 days. Workers varied in the length of time they spent as a guard. Most bees guarded for less than 1 days; however, some guarded up to 6 consecutive days. The more time a bee spent guarding during a day the more likely that bee was to guard for more than 1 day. Bees that guarded for more than 1 day also had longer and more frequent individual guarding bouts. All colonies that were studied had guard populations, but not all workers guarded. A relatively small proportion of any age cohort was observed to guard. The percentage of an age cohort that guarded varied among colonies, as did the size of the guard population. Guarding is a specialized task in that few bees guard, but guarding does not appear to require experience because so few bees remained as guards for very long. There was intercolonial variation in all aspects of the ontogeny of guarding and in allocation of workers to guarding. This variation is discussed in the light of other studies of variation in worker behaviour. © 1987.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0003082137

The proportion of non-B genes in a sample of drones was used to measure the ""genetic pollution"" in the local population. Within the course of a breeding scheme of local bees, 99 queens, whose genotypes are BB, were naturally mated between April 25 and June 10, 1985 at la Tave (Gard, France). Twenty daughters-workers of each queen were analysed at the MDH locus. The frequency of the B allele in drones that mated with these queens is estimated by the proportion of workers with genotype BB and the genetic pollution by the cumulated frequency of the other alleles. The sampling variances of these frequencies involve a coefficient which is a function of the average number of drones mated with a queen. This latter parameter is estimated through the maximum likelihood method. In addition to the three well-known alleles, a rare allele (frequency=0.0055), possibly equivalent to the S1 allele described by Badino et al. (1983), has been found in three different colonies. Cumulating the frequencies of the non-B alleles results in an estimation of the genetic pollution equal to 0.0394 (±0.0071). This low value allows us to proceed to the next step of the selection project.

Sociality entails at least a partial loss of personal reproduction by some individuals, a seeming contradiction to the expectation that it be maximized by natural selection. The theory of kin selection1,2 seeks to explain social evolution by reference to high degrees of genetic relatedness among cooperating individuals. In the most diverse and conspicuous of social organisms, the social Hymenoptera (ants, bees, wasps), kin selection theory has been especially attractive because the malehaploid genetic system of the group leads to potentially high relatedness among female nestmates3-5. Multiple mating by queens poses a serious difficulty for kin selection, however, in that it reduces nestmate relatedness unless sperm from different males are used non-randomly6-10. This possibility has been investigated in only one highly social insect, the honey bee Apis mellifera, where the absence of suitable genetic markers has necessitated the use of artificial insemination10,11. In this first study of long-term sperm utilization in natural populations of highly social insects I show that queens of two social wasp species use sperm from different males in relatively constant proportions through time, resulting in consistently low relatedness among female nestmates. I also show that workers do not supplement their inclusive fitness by reproducing directly in colonies in which the mother queen is present. © 1986 Nature Publishing Group.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022829540

Homologous large first-order interneurons (L-neurons) from different individuals vary in structure as well as in their response to light. Even the response patterns of one type of L-neuron may present a continuum from graded responses to spiking responses. The response depends on the state of the L-neuron and cannot be correlated with particular morphological types. Graded responses are unimodal and can be elicited exclusively by stationary illumination of the ocelli, whereas spiking L-neurons can also respond to stimuli of other sensory modalities. Recordings from the same type of multimodal spiking L-neuron in different individuals demonstrate considerable variation in responses to different modalities. The existence of two response patterns in the same cell that can encode different information may be of general importance with respect to the processing of information in the brain. There appears to be a variety of different pathways enabling interaction of ocellar and compound eye signals either by direct contact between ocellar and optic lobe neurons or by convergence of the two pathways to a common descending or local interneuron. Two examples are discussed: an ocellar small first-order interneuron (S-neuron) that project directly to the optic lobes and a local interneuron that is situated in the posterior midbrain close to situated in the posterior midbrain close to ocellar terminals and optic lobe outputs and that responds to stimulation of both visual systems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022963038

The rate of iron accumulation was directly related to iron levels in the diet, and the iron can be obtained from pollen and honey, both major food sources of the bee. In adults, the iron content of the fat body reached a maximum level (2.4 +/- 0.15 micrograms mg-1 tissue), regardless of the amount of iron available for ingestion.

Important periods in the life of the mite correspond to definite patterns of filling in of the neurosecretory cell groups. Material of cell group 1, which is situated in the medial protocerebral area of the synganglion, supports molting and oviposition. Secretion of cell group 2, which lies between the two ganglionic masses, seems to be necessary during the whole reproductive process. Cell group 8, located at the opisthosomal ganglion where the genital nerves leave the subesophageal ganglion, seems to be mainly responsible for the initiation of reproduction. Juvenile hormone (JHIII) in the hemolymph of the bees acts on the mites as a release mechanism for reproductive behavior with entry into the brood cell of the bee. Mites on bees with a low JHIII titer that are sprayed with external JHIII show a similar neurosecretion pattern to mites parasitizing bees with a high JHIII titer. The influence of external JHIII on the degree in which the three cell groups are filled with neurosecretion is discussed with respect to the regulatory mechanisms. In this parasite-host relationship there is a clear synchronization of the reproductive cycle of the mite with the metamorphosis and hormonal regulation of the bee. © 1986 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250123088

At 7600 pollen grains/mg pollen, the yearly output per saguaro plant is 6.4×108 grains. Based on the measured saguaro density of 6.56 plants/ha, 553 g/ha of pollen is produced yearly. The enormous variation among individual plants in terms of flower numbers and floral bloom patterns is documented. Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.), the main collectors of saguaro pollen, collect an average of 12.2 mg pollen per foraging trip and can thus harvest 23.5 pollen loads from one flower. An average honey bee colony collects 290 g of saguaro pollen over the season, which is 24.4% of their total intake. Individual colonies exhibit wide variation in pollen collecting activities with some closely tracking the pollen resource and others almost totally ignoring it. The average for seven colonies indicates that even though variation is great the overall trend is toward closely tracking and exploiting the saguaro pollen resource. Based on the pollen productivity of saguaro and a hypothetical 90% pollen harvesting efficiency of bees, the pollen harvest potential of the saguaro environment is 1.72 colony equivalents of pollen/ha and 0.5/ha for saguaro alone.

Honeybees increased their foraging efficiency by accepting less empty flowers and rejecting more empty flowers than would be expected if they foraged randomly. There are two possible mechanisms for this discrimination-behavior: either the bees are smelling nectar odor or they are smelling bee scent left by previous visitors to the flower.

Predictions based on maximisation of rate of energy gain, defined as net energy gained per unit time foraging, are significantly different from observed behaviour (Schmid-Hempel et al. 1985). In this paper we consider the effect of varying travel times in addition to flow rate. The predictions of an extended version of our theoretical model are confronted with experimental results obtained by Núñez (1982). Núñez found that bees filled their crops more fully for higher flows and longer travel times. We show that when the cost of carrying a load is considered, this trend can be predicted by maximising either energetic efficiency or net rate of gain. Figure 1 shows, however, that maximisation of net rate of gain can only produce an acceptable quantitative fit if unreasonably high costs are assumed to result from carrying the load. Energetic efficiency instead generates a good quantitative fit for acceptable assumptions about this cost (Fig. 2). © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022831107

The conventional flash method gives the least reliable results. Sensitivity is extremely sensitive to small fluctuations of the resting potential and long lasting changes induced by preceding test flashes. The ramp method, which speeds up a spectral scan to about 1 min and keeps effective illumination constant at every flash, determines S(λ) much more reliably. The best results are obtained with the spectral scan method, which provides the experimenter with a S(λ) function of high spectral resolution within 20 s. Using this method we demonstrate that the high observed variability in S(λ) of individual receptors is the result of the inadequacy of the flash method, which was the only method used in earlier studies. Double microelectrode experiments and variations of the stimulus conditions reveal that field potentials and return flow of electric current produced by activated neighboring cells have no effect in the bee eye. We conclude that the model of Shaw (1975, 1981) of current flow in the locust and fly eye does not apply to the bee eye. Very rare recordings (about 1%) of UV receptors with hyperpolarizing responses to long wavelength light are interpreted as having a synaptic inhibitory connection to green receptors.

Embryos of equal age showed little variation, so that staging could be based on developmental age. Our data confirm many earlier light microscopical observations, but are at variance with some others. The cytoplasmic connections between the future blastoderm cells and the central yolk system are severed only at the onset of gastrulation. The serosa derives from cells which immigrate into the dorsal strip and then join up to form a pre-serosa bordering the germ band rims. When the serosa has detached, the amnion grows out from the germ band margins and serves as a provisional dorsal epithelium right from the beginning. Germ band segmentation is followed by the transient regression of every second transverse groove (double segment pattern). The germ band flanks grow dorsally and replace the amnion a few hr before hatching (dorsal closure). The tracheal openings which form half-way between segment borders are closed temporarily by the embryonic cuticle; similar openings above the labial buds contribute to the tentorium rather than the tracheal system.

Previous descriptions of the 280-Hz sounds emitted by the dancing bee were confirmed, and no vibrational (substrate-borne) component could be detected. In contrast, the 320-Hz ""begging signals"" (emitted by bees following a dancer and used as a request for food samples from the dancer) do vibrate the comb with peak-peak displacement amplitudes up to 1.5 μm. Artificially-generated comb vibrations of sufficient amplitude cause bees standing on the comb to ""freeze"". The threshold for obtaining a detectable freezing response was measured for frequencies between 100 Hz and 3 kHz. At 320 Hz it is just below the amplitude of the natural begging signals. Thus it seems likely that these signals are received by the bees as vibrations of the comb. The propagation velocity of waves, damping, and mechanical input impedance of honeybee combs were studied. These results, combined with the observed amplitudes of the begging signals, support the assumption that the begging signals are generated with the flight muscles. The begging signal propagates as a bending wave. The attenuation of the begging signal with distance is relatively small, so the amplitude of the signal probably needs to be carefully adjusted in order to restrict the range of the communication. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000104039

Results on the motor innervation were compared with those of earlier work, yielding some corrections and new findings. The nerve to the mandibular abductor muscle not only carries motor fibers but also supplies sensory branches to the head integument and to the presumptive proprioceptors which probably monitor movements of the proboscis. A small neural mass which is equipped with two systems for proprioception is situated at the point where the mandibular nerve divides into its major branches. One system is composed of receptor muscles stretched between the anterior tentorial arm (AT) and the mandible and multipolar cells. The other is composed of elastic strands between AT and the apodeme of a smaller branch of the mandibular adductor and tripolar cells. The former is stretched by mandibular abduction and the latter by adduction. The two systems collectively are called the mandibular muscle receptor organ. There are two groups of receptor muscles: the outer receptor muscle, which is located outside the neural mass, and the inner receptor muscle located within. Only the latter is innervated by multipolar cells. Another, single, multipolar cell is attached to the surface of the tendon of the inner receptor muscle. A further pair of bipolar‐multiterminal cells attaches to the epidermis at the extremity of the apodeme of the mandibular adductor. One originates from the mandibular nerve and the other from the labral nerve. Both presumably respond to the epidermal expansion caused by mandibular abduction.

Despite sharing most pollen resources and nectar of the same quality with 20 introduced colonies of the African honey bee (Apis mellifera), native stingless bees of 12 species were largely unaffected by its activity. Pollen and nectar harvested by the honey bees were 10–200 times that procured by 17 stingless bee colonies. This discrepancy in total harvest and general lack of competitive effect is explained by a honey bee foraging area over 10 times that of the native bees, and apparent foraging shifts to escape competition with honey bees, thus reduced potential overlap in foraging sites. Seven cases of direct resource competition for pollen or nectar were documented, out of 31 tests. Rare periods of intensive harvest were diminished by competing African honey bees. Such harvest peaks lasted for only a few hours in 13 days of observation. Despite average duration of 4% foraging time for each species, peaks included as much as 51% total harvest. Calculations based upon colony populations, food stores and flight range show that if African honey bees persist at a density of 1 colony per km2, colonies of some stingless bee species may disappear after 10 years.

The fine structure and function of a honey bee's (Apis mellifera Linn.) proventriculus were studied by scanning electron microscopy and video‐recording. Our observations revealed that the proventriculus is used to engulf pollen and other particles which contaminate the nectar carried into the crop. The four lips are closed and opened, pulled backwards and straightened by the external circular muscles and internal longitudinal muscles. Combs of filiform‐hairs (70 μm in length) located on the margins of the lips ‘catch’ and filter particles from the fluid. By repeated filtering, opening and closing actions of the hairs and lips, particles are filtered and collected in pouches between the ventricular folds to form boluses and are eventually passed into the midgut. In the present experiment, particle sizes ranging from 0.5 to 100 μm in diameter, including dandelion pollen (Taraxacum officinale Web.), Torula yeast (Candida utilis Lodder et Kreger‐Van Rij), bee disease spores of Nosema apis Zander and Bacillus larvae White, and man‐made particles can be filtered by the hairs. Small particles (0.23 μm in diameter) filter through the hair and return back to the fluid. Large particles (100–200 μm in diameter) are caught between the stylets of the mouthparts and are not ingested. These observations suggest that the particle size plays an important role in determining what can be taken by the mouthparts and the proventriculus and what can later be utilized as a food source by the bee. The role of the proventriculus in disease transmission is also discussed. Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell.

The species used were: Bos taurus (arginine rich nuclear protein also containing cystine residues), Pichroplus bergi, Triatoma infestans (arginine-rich nuclear protein), Lytechinus variegatus and Apis mellifera (lysine-rich nuclear protein). The spermatozoa were subjected to Feulgen's reaction, after varying the fixative type and the hydrolysis times. Feulgen-DNA values were obtained with an automatic scanning cytophotometric procedure. Differences were demonstrated in the hydrolysis kinetics as a function of differences in composition of the DNA-protein complexes being present in the spermatozoon chromatin. Differences in the profiles of Feulgen hydrolysis curves, having for basis the fixation, were rather clear for bull, grasshopper, and blood-sucking insect spermatozoa than for the sea-urchin and bee spermatozoa. The different hydrolysis kinetics of chromatin of blood-sucking insect spermatozoa compared to that of grasshopper, sea-urchin, and bee sperm cells suggests that, although the first 2 materials contain an arginine-rich “germinative” protein and the latter 2 ones contain a lysine-rich protein, these differ to each other. The DNA depurination was obtained more quickly for T. infestans (20 min) and P. bergi (10 min) spermatozoa when they were fixed in the etanol-acetic acid (EA) mixture. Morphologically anomalous bull spermatozoa fixed in the EA mixture presented a quicker depurination (30 min) as compared to the normal cells (1 h). The fast lability to acid hydrolysis in the abnormal cells is certainly due to anomalies in their basic nuclear “germinative” protein. In the formalin fixed materials the maximal depurination was obtained earlier in bull spermatozoa (30 min) followed by sperm cells of P. bergi, T. infestans, L. variegatus (all of them one-hour hydrolysis) and finally Apis mellifera (2 h hydrolysis). The presence of secondary peaks at the descending branch of the hydrolysis curves of grasshopper and sea-urchin spermatozoa, indicates for these, more than 1 kind of apurinic-acid protein complexes. The spermatozoa bearing arginine-and/or cystine-rich nuclear protein contain a more easily soluble apurinic acid protein complex. Due to the differences in hydrolysis kinetics of chromatin in spermatozoa containing different nuclear “germinative” proteins, this cellular type does not appear indicated as a haploid control for evaluation of Feulgen-DNA contents of diploid and polyploid somatic cells. © 1986, VEB Gustav Fischer Verlag Jena.

In the texts, bees could visit a row of four or five flowers. At the end of the row, bees were given a choice of direction for their next flight (i.e. forward, left, right, or backward). I investigated the effect of a reward sequence in relation to (1) the average amount of 'nectar' gathered in the last few flower visits, regardless of the sequence of occurrence, or to (2) the reward received in the most recent flower visits. A reward given at the choice point itself reduced flight directionality. Effects of rewards offered on preceding flowers, i.e. one, two, or three steps before the choice point, were not significant. There was, however, evidence for their additional effect. It is concluded that the influence of a reward on flight directionality vanishes rapidly as more flower visits are made. © 1986.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022842486

Directional movement by foraging honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) was studied on several flower arrays. The most frequent move among equidistant flower stalks was straight ahead from stalk to stalk with frequencies decreasing for increasing turn angles. Turns to the left were about equal in frequency to turns to the right. Bees maintained directionality when moving from flower stalks that had been rotated 90° counterclockwise while the bee was on the stalk (no difference between moves from rotated stalks and unrotated controls). Thus, directionality is maintained by the bee and is not an artefact of flower distribution. Bees also maintained directionality when the entire array was rotated around the flower stalk the bee was on. Thus, bees use an external cue to orientate in a given direction rather than fixing on an inflorescence within the flower array. Bees foraging on very different flower arrays differed in patterns of directionality and in distances flown between flower stalks. Therefore, even though bees maintain directionality using external cues, flower distribution can nevertheless influence flight patterns. Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell.

In the analysed species with polytrophic ovaries (Apis mellifica, Pimpla turionellae, Bradysia tritici, Ephestia kuehniella, Protophormia terraenovae) a dense F-actin network was found to be associated with the nurse cell membranes. Only in Protophormia were microfilament bundles seen to extend from the cell membrane into the nurse cell cytoplasm and in a few cases appeared to make contact with the nuclear membrane. In the analysed coleopteran species with telotrophic ovarioles (Strangalia melanura, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, Oryzaephilus surinamensis) the fluorescence was also concentrated at the nurse cell membranes only. However, in all analysed hemipteran species (Lygus pratensis, Calocoris affinis, Graphosoma lineatum, Euscelis plebejus) the microfilament pattern was very different: while the nurse cells stained only weakly, we always found a characteristic (in some species massive) microfilament network surrounding the trophic core, a central area in the germarium from where material is transported through the trophic cords into the oocytes.

Drone larvae of both Apis mellifera and A. cerana contain more than 5 ng/ml juvenile hormone in the haemolymph during the first 60 h after brood cell capping. Worker brood of A. mellifera contains 3-7 ng/ml whereas A. cerana does not reach 1 ng/ml during the first day after sealing. Juvenile hormone concentrations lower than 4 ng/ml seem to be one factor to prevent reproduction of the mites. Varroa, having parasitized on winter bees (low juvenile hormone titre) show 8% reproduction after beeing transfered to suitable brood cells. Mites from old summer bees (high juvenile hormone titre) show 76% reproduction. Varroa from winter bees transfered to larvae which were treated with juvenile hormone show 18%, and mites parasitizing winter bees sprayed with juvenile hormone showed 39% reproduction. Juvenile hormone effects could be demonstrated down to the cellular level in oögenesis. Our results suggest a model for a 2-fold influence of host juvenile hormone on Varroa: The first influence on the adult bee which might be necessary for the cell-entering behaviour and preparation of the ovary. The second one on the bee larva obviously triggers yolk incorporation into the eggs of the mite and induces oviposition. © 1986.","Apis; host influence; Juvenile hormone (III); parasite; reproduction; Varroa",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249043979

The two phytophagous species of bees have in common relatively high levels of 24‐methylenecholesterol and very low levels of cholesterol (&lt;1% of total sterols). The isofucosterol content (40.7%) of M. rotundata was nearly three times that of A. mellifera, but overall utilization of dietary sterols in the two species is similar in that neither is able to convert C28 and C29 phytosterols to cholesterol. All four omnivorous species are predatory to some extent, and the fact that their usual dietary sterols include high levels of chlosterol is reflected in the sterols isolated from these species, which contain 45–81% cholesterol.

The level of chalk brood disease ranged from negligible to over 6% and was lowest in the colonies with foundation or super comb, intermediate in the colonies with fumigated comb, and highest in the colonies with the two types of older brood comb.

In the models considered, the variances of the allele frequency change at the sex locus (close to equilibrium), and at ordinary loci, have a similar general appearance and they are inversely related to the effective population size. This suggests that supersedure breeding programmes affect genetic variation at the two types of loci qualitatively in a similar way. Quantitatively, the allele frequency changes at the sex locus are affected more strongly by selection than by breeding programmes when the number of sex alleles in the population is relatively small.

Overall, the optimal colony size was 9000 bees; the rate of weight gain in colonies of this size was nearer to that of the two largest populations and the rate of brood production was nearer to that of the two smaller colonies. © 1986 International Bee Research Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002274021

These differences were not found when brood was in the egg stage and pollen stores were small, but were large and significant when brood was in the larval stage and pollen stores were more abundant. Differences in amounts of stored pollen that were established between the lines during the larval stage were maintained after brood cells were capped, but amounts of pollen stored did not change significantly. HPH bees also hoarded more pollen in the absence of brood. The two lines used similar amounts of pollen and reared similar amounts of brood. Mortality of the LPH bees was higher and varied significantly more than that of the HPH bees.

Foraging-age workers responded to the vibration dance by moving into the area of the hive where waggle dances were concentrated and by increasing their rate of movement throughout the colony. Vibrated non-foraging-age bees did not move into the waggle dance region or exhibit increased movement in the hive. Small peaks of vibration dance activity, which tended to coincide temporally with small peaks of foraging activity, occurred with a similar frequency throughout the year. These small vibration peaks may have adjusted foraging to short-term fluctuations in food availability. In spring and summer all study hives exhibited large, morning peaks of vibration dance activity, which preceded foraging. Since there was a significant, positive slope for the regression of the magnitude of these morning vibration peaks on the mean level of waggle dancing occurring later during the same day, morning vibration activity may have exerted a long-term 'priming' influence on foraging behaviour. In fall and winter, compared with spring and summer, morning vibration dance peaks were smaller, less frequent and tended to coincide with, rather than to precede, foraging activity. © 1986.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0005573829

Regardless of the dietary sterols available to worker bees, the major tissue sterol of brood reared by the workers is always 24-methylenecholesterol, followed by sitosterol and isofucosterol. Normally, little or no cholesterol is present in honey bee sterols. The maintenance of high levels of certain sterols is accomplished through a selective transfer of sterols from the endogenous sterol pools of the workers to the developing larvae through the brood food material secreted from the hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands and/or the honey stomach of the workers. The selective uptake and transfer of radiolabeled C27, C28 and C29 sterols have been studied to correlate these aspects of sterol utilization with the discovery of an unusual molting hormone (ecdysteroid) in honey bee pupae as the major ecdysteroid of this stage of development. The phylogenetic implications of this selective transfer phenomenon in the honey bee and comparison with sterol metabolism in certain other hymenopteran species emphasize the diversity of steroid biochemistry in insects. © 1986 American Oil Chemists' Society.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51249179134

The counting and measurement of all the glomeruli were performed on 5 worker bees and 5 drones. An important sexual dimorphism, represented by 4 large and easily identifiable glomerular complexes, was demonstrated in the drone. In both worker bee and drone, four main regions of the glomerular neuropil were distinguished according to corresponding afferent bundles. The worker possessed 166 glomeruli and the drone 103. The number, position and dimensions of the glomeruli indicated that the glomerular organization was unvarying in worker bees and in drones. Concerning the internal structure of the glomeruli, two types were distinguished: the great majority (95%) exhibited a cortical layer, whereas in the 7 posterior glomeruli the synaptic fields of association seemed to be scattered throughout the whole volume.

In the presence of melittin, a cell lysing peptide from honey bee (Apis mellifera) venom, dose-dependent loss of rotational mobility was observed. Chemically modified melittin derivatives, in which free amine groups were either acetylated or succinylated, were impaired in their ability to induce immobilisation of bacteriorhodopsin. Bacteriorhodopsin reconstitutions of differing lipid / protein ratio were tested and it was found that the bacteriorhodopsin immmobilisation phenomena depended on the melittin / protein ratio, not the melittin / lipid ratio. This suggests that melittin produces its effect via direct interaction with bacteriorhodopsin.

Incorporation of [3H]eucine into soluble tissue proteins was measured. The new medium makes possible rates of tracer incorporation into fat body proteins that are up to three times higher than other media tested. When the tracheal system of the organs was let intact and open to the air during incubation, protein synthesis increased 17-fold (fat body) or 15-fold (ovary) as compared to preparations without open tracheas.

Movements of Na+ were induced by light stimulation, or by increasing [K+] in the superfusate. In the dark, aNa in the photoreceptors was 10 mM (S.E. of the mean = 1 mM); in the glial cells it was higher: 37 +/‐ 2 mM. We estimate that in this preparation about 2/3 of the free Na+ in the tissue is in the glial cells. Stimulation with a train of light flashes, 1 s‐1 for 90 s caused aNa in the photoreceptors to increase by 16 +/‐ 2 mM. K+ activity, aK, decreased by 21 +/‐ 3 mM. During the standard train of light flashes, aNa in glial cells decreased by only 1.5 +/‐ 0.3 mM, much less than the increase in aK (7 +/‐ 2 mM). One possible interpretation of this result is that most of the increase in aK is due to K+ uptake by a mechanism other than Na+‐K+ exchange. In extracellular fluid, stimulation caused aNa to fall to a relatively steady value in about 10 s. Unlike aK, there was no tendency for aNa to return to the base line during the remainder of the 90 s stimulation. The fall in aNa was 14 +/‐ 1 mM: a greater fall is prevented by extracellular electric currents and a decrease in extracellular volume. When [K+] in the superfusate was increased from 7.5 to 18 mM, aNa decreased in the glial cells but not in the photoreceptors. In this tissue, stimulation causes changes in aNa in the neurones that might be large enough to modify the biochemistry of the cells. But in the glia, the fractional changes are small. © 1985 The Physiological Society",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021894049

Most flying drones were attracted to extracts of mandibular glands but a few were drawn to other cephalic tissues or to solvent controls. Histological and electron microscope studies showed that the structure of the tiny (0.12 mm long) mandibular gland varied according to age. Its secretory activity in 0-3-day old drones was evident from the abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum. At 7-days the glands were fully developed.

This simulated loss in worker population was similar to naturally occurring events in feral colonies such as predation, swarming, nest damage, and (or) disease. Foraging age was negatively correlated with area of eggs and larvae and was not correlated with pupal area. Honeybee colonies thus can adjust temporal caste structure in response to rapid changes in colony conditions such as worker loss.

Various authors have reported that nectar‐collecting bees usually maintain an overall degree of directionality in their successive foraging flights. I here ask what kind of cues honeybees (Apis mellifera) use to decide on departure direction from one inflorescence to the next. In a horizontally placed flower array, individual workers were experimentally rotated while imbibing sugar solution from an artificial flower mounted on a turntable. Rotation itself did not affect the subsequent departure direction. However, rotating the bees by 180° resulted in choices that were rotated by the same amount, as compared to the control treatment (i.e. no rotation). I suggest that flight directionality is determined in bees from the spatial orientation of their body before departure (e.g. by moving to the nearest flower they face).

Native bees, nocturnal moths and ants also visited flowers but were too infrequent, did not move between plants or foraged inappropriately to be important pollinators. No mammals were seen visiting flowers and the small mammals we caught carried no pollen. Exclusion experiments confirmed that pollination occurred during the day and not at night, but the experiments were insufficient to determine the relative importance of honeybees versus birds as pollinators. Only about 3% of the flowers of Banksia ericifolia developed follicles under natural conditions.

The adaptive significance of the timing of growth and reproduction by honeybee, Apis mellifera L., colonies in cold climates was studied by describing the seasonal patterns of food storage, brood rearing, and swarming, and then observing the consequences of experimentally perturbing the seasonal cycles of brood rearing and swarming. 2. Colonies consume large amounts of food over winter (20+ kg of honey), but have only a brief period (about 14 weeks) for food collection each year. 3. The honeybee's striking habits of starting brood rearing in midwinter and swarming in late spring evidently help colonies achieve maximum use of the short summer season. Colonies whose onset of‐brood rearing was experimentally postponed until early spring showed greatly retarded colony growth and swarming. Other experiments demonstrated that late swarms starve more often during winter than do early swarms. 4.

Each change starts in the differentiation center located in the anterior egg half and from there spreads as a wave towards both poles. However, one of the waves is heterogeneous: the protrusions or caps of oolemma which start enveloping the preblastoderm nuclei arise in different ways in the anterior third and in the more posterior regions of the egg cell. After the formation of these protrusions, three mitotic waves pass over the peripheral nuclei. The last of these blastemal mitoses results in a two-layered arrangement of peripheral nuclei, each surrounded by an outpocketing of the egg cell basally confluent with the central yolky part. This two-layered state after some time transforms into a single layer of columnar outpocketings which increase in height by extending their borders centripetally into the secondary periplasm (inner ‘Keimhautblastem’). The outpocketings disconnect from the central yolk mass as separate blastoderm cells only a short time before gastrulation.

The improved clarity and contrast of the stained mites within the tracheae in the thin thoracic sections facilitated the detection process.

The uppermost dorsal part of the honey bee's compound eye contains a group of c. 150 specialized ommatidia. The photoreceptors of these ommatidia are characterized by a number of anatomical and physiological peculiarities which suggest that they have functional significance for the detection of polarized skylight. Here, we show by painting out different parts of the eye and recording the bee's behavioural responses that the specialized photoreceptors at the dorsal margin of the eye are indeed necessary for detecting polarized skylight and deriving compass information from celestial e‐vector patterns. Hence, this group of specialized ommatidia can be called the POL area of the bee's compound eye. Copyright © 1985, Wiley Blackwell.

However, in A. cerana and A. florea foraging at artificial feeders the dance tempo was observed to decline (i.e., the time per dance increased) more rapidly than has been reported for A. mellifera as distance to the food source increased. Apis cerana and A. florea forage over short distances; at 3 of the 6 sites in this trial A. cerana did not visit feeders beyond 500 m. In A. dorsata the change in dance tempo with increasing distance to forage was much slower and similar, in this respect, to that reported for A. mellifera. Both A. dorsata and A. mellifera are able to forage over long distances, although in this trial 72% of A. dorsata foragers did not fly beyond 400 m. Apis cerana and A. florea may be unable to communicate long distances to food sources, as these distances would be indicated by very slow dances. These potential intrinsic limits, and observed constraints on foraging distance in A. cerana, suggests that beekeepers should manage A. cerana in small, well separated apiaries. In this way floral resources over small areas would not become so depleted by high densities of bees that honey yields are reduced. © 1985 International Bee Research Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0008028457

The digestion of dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) pollen by adult worker honeybees (Apis mellifera Linn.; Hymenoptera: Apidae) was initiated at the germination pores. 30 min after feeding, pollen had reached the anterior midgut and the germination pores had become swollen. This permitted further removal of protoplasm during the next 2 h of digestion as the pollen passed into the middle portion of the midgut. 3 h after feeding, pollen grains had reached the posterior midgut where some had ruptured to release both ‘naked’ protoplasm and masses of protoplasm but many remained intact or were only partially digested; undigested pollen grains passed unchanged to the rectum. The lipid‐rich pollenkitt layer was removed from the exine during digestion. Our studies indicate that dandelion pollen was not utilized completely by honeybees. Copyright © 1985, Wiley Blackwell.

Satsuma) were examined in an orchard in the Goulburn Valley area of Victoria. Trees which were accessible to honeybees (Apis mellifera) had a higher percentage pollination rate (3.2 times) greater weight of fruit (2.6 times) and more fruit (3.3 times) than did the trees that were enclosed to exclude bees and large insects. Honeybees comprised 88.5% of all insect visitors to the flowers. The behaviour patterns of other insects were such that they would effect little or no pollination. Pollen gathering bees are considered the main pollinators of this species because of their activity early in flowering. No native bees (Trigona spp.) were seen to visit the flowers. While parthenocarpy and wind pollination may produce some fruit on Satsuma, the presence of an adequate population of honeybees is necessary to set a satisfactory crop. © 1985 CSIRO.

There were significant quantitative and qualitative differences between the hydrocarbons of the 4 species of Apis. The quantity of hydrocarbon per bee was higher for A. dorsata and A. cerana than for A. mellifera, and even the quantity found in the much smaller A. florea approached that of A. mellifera.

All species and mixes of pollen, even the poorly nutritive and unpreferred cottonwood pollen (P. fremontii) contained phagostimulants. Phagostimulants were found in extracts prepared with polar solvents, non-polar solvents, and solvents of intermediate polarity. Phagostimulants were found in all fractions collected from silicic acid column chromatography except the least polar fraction consisting mainly of hydrocarbons and other extremely non-polar compounds. Thus the results suggest that phagostimulants in pollen are not limited to one discrete class of compounds, and likely comprise a variety of compounds. Pollen consumption by bees is probably induced primarily by the cumulative effects of numerous compounds in pollen in the absence of specific repellents, rather than by one or a few specific compounds. © 1985 International Bee Research Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0005564240

Honeybees associated food with colour and/or odour and established individually constant foraging patterns. In a patch of colour-dimorphic flowers some bees were constant to yellow and some to blue flowers when all flowers provided clove-scented rewards. The colour-constancy of individual bees was not altered when the scent of all rewards was changed to peppermint. However, when the scent of only one colour morph was changed, some bees remained constant to colour, whereas others switched colour attachment and remained constant to odour. In a patch of uniformly coloured but odour-dimorphic flowers some bees were constant to peppermint-scented and some were constant to cinnamon-scented flowers. A change in the colour of all flowers did not reduce the level of odour-constant foraging. Individual constancy to either colour or to odour can be sufficient to restrict gene flow between flower morphs.

Multiple linear regression analysis was used to quantify the relationship between the dependent variable, RATE, and the two energy variables. There was significant variation among bees in dance behaviour. However, the absolute magnitude of the CLACOST coefficients tended to be larger than CALGAIN coefficients; bees may weight perceptions of costs in relation to intakes. Honey bees were presented with a series of binary choices between yellow or blue tubular artificial flowers in order to assess how cost-intake information is used to make choices among flowers. In eight experiments the 2 flowers had different combinations of volume of sucrose (intake) and tube depth (handling cost).

An analysis of variance indicated significant differences between years for both honey production and results on each laboratory test. Corbicular area was an important component of, or significantly correlated with, colony honey production in 2 of the 3 years it was examined. Hoarding behaviour, longevity and pupal weight were important in 1, 3 and 5 of 6 years, respectively. Of the 4 sets of laboratory tests, only results on the test of hoarding behaviour were not significantly correlated with colony honey production when all 6 years were combined. Therefore, over a period of years, these tests apparently measured significant components of colony honey production. Of the 6 possible phenotypic correlations among the 4 laboratory tests, coefficients for all but hoarding behaviour with corbicular area were significant, implying the influence of a number of common genes. As all 6 correlation coefficients were positive, it should be possible to select simultaneously for the 4 components represented in the laboratory tests. Because there is wide year-to-year variation in the effects of the environment on honey production (reflected in variation in significance for correlations between honey yields and individual tests), it is unlikely that field-tests of full-strength colonies alone will be reliable for identifying superior breeding stock to achieve genetic improvement in honey production. The 4 laboratory tests, and others yet to be developed, should be employed to achieve genetic improvement in honey production. These conclusions, based on estimates of the phenotypic correlation, would be strengthened greatly by additional evidence from genetic correlation estimates. © 1985 International Bee Research Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845237591

Aggressive workers spent significantly more time in a ball than did nonaggressive workers, but there was no difference in age between the two subgroups. Foreign queens were not killed immediately upon introduction and were not continuously attacked throughout the balling period. Balling workers gradually became conditioned to some foreign queens beginning 3-5 h after introduction; the incidence of worker aggression steaily decreased while queen activity increased.

Directionality decreases with (1) an increasing amount of energy taken from a flower, (2) an increasing amount of time spent on a flower, or (3) an increasing profitability of the flower, i.e. rate of nectar uptake. The bees were tested singly on an arrangement with equidistant flowers. They could move from a decision point forward, right, left, or backwards to the next flower. The rewards at the decision point were altered. When rewards at this point were compared that offered the same quality of ""nectar"" (50% sugar solution), the time hypothesis (2) was consistent with the observed behaviour of the bees. When conditions were compared that involved two different reward qualities (50% and 25% sugar solation), none of the original hypotheses could entirely account for the results. It is suggested that a slight modification of the time hypothesis would be consistent with the observations: The bees might possibly ""forget"" their arrival direction on the flower with increasing time, but forgetting the direction of the last flower visited is intensified with more concentrated rewards. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000565455

The mushroom bodies consist of layers of parallel intrinsic neurons which make synaptic contact with extrinsic input and output neurons. The intrinsic neurons (approximately 170,000/mushroom body) have very small axon diameters (0.1-1 μm) which makes it difficult to record their activity intracellularly. In order to analyse the functional properties of this neuropil field potentials were measured extracellularly. Series of averaged evoked potentials (AEPs) were recorded along electrode tracks at consecutive depth intervals in different parts of the mushroom bodies of the bee. These potentials were elicited by olfactory, mechanical and visual stimuli. In order to locate the synaptic areas generating these potentials, current source-densities (CSD) were calculated using the consecutively measured evoked potentials. The conductivities of the extracellular space along the electrode tracks in the pedunculus and calyx and in part of the alpha-lobe of the mushroom bodies were found to be constant. The CSD analysis reveals a complex pattern of source-sink distributions in the mushroom bodies. There is a high degree of correlation between current sinks and sources detected by CSD analysis and the morphological distribution of neurons. The CSD analysis shows that the inputs and outputs of the mushroom bodies involve multimodal synaptic interactions, whereas information processing in the intrinsic Kenyon-cells is limited to sensory inputs from the antenna. Comparison of the electrophysiological with the histological results shows that the intrinsic cells of the mushroom bodies are physiologically not a homogeneous group as is often proposed. Among the intrinsic neurons clearly defined areas of current sources and sinks can be identified and attributed to Kenyon-cells in different layers. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0004812536

In the presence of melittin, a pharmacologically active polypeptide from honey bee (Apis mellifera) venom, a dose-dependent loss of rotational mobility was detected. With acetylated melittin, the ability to immobilise is reduced. Succinylated melittin, however, is devoid of immobilising activity. The possible relevance of these findings to the normal mode of action of melittin was examined by comparing the relative abilities of the native, acetylated and succinylated melittins to lyse erythrocytes and synergise with phospholipase A2, another constituent of bee venom. For both these properties, the order of effectiveness is native melittin &gt; acetyl melittin &gt; succinyl melittin = 0, the same as their order of effectiveness in immobilising band 3. A mechanism is proposed in which melittin is anchored in the membrane by its hydrophobic N-terminus, while its cationic C-terminal moiety binds to negatively charged residues on membrane proteins. This leads either directly or indirectly to protein aggregation and hence loss of mobility. From a detailed comparison of the different effects of the melittin derivatives, it is concluded that melittin may function in vivo by aggregating membrane proteins in order to allow phospholipase A2 to gain access to the membrane bilayer and commence catalysis. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.","Band 3; erythrocyte; melittin; phospholipase A2; rotational diffusion; transient dichroism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021119716

Für die Vermehrung der parasitischen Milbe Varroa jacobsoni ist die Zeitspanne entscheidend, die zwischen der Zellverdecklung und dem Schlupf der adulten Biene liegt. Hier schränkt die Kürze der Zeit bei der Kap‐Biene die Vermehrung drastisch ein. Nur 21% der untersuchten, reproduktionsfähigen Milbenweibchen waren in der Lage infektiöse Töchter zu erzeugen. Dagegen fanden sich bei 100% der untersuchten Milben in A. mellifera carnica‐Zellen ausgewachsene Nachkommen. Laborversuche wie auch Beobachtungen im Freiland weisen darauf hin, daß sich der Verlauf der Varroatose bei Kap‐Bienen deutlich weniger gefährlich darstellt als in den europäischen Bienenrassen. 1984 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024587235

In the honey bee, Apis mellifera L., the venom gland shows many of the fine structural features of primitive glands. A honey bee venom gland is a simple, long, thin, distally bifurcated structure, opening into an ovoid reservoir. Along most of the length of the gland are similar secretory units that have four major components (secretory cells, duct cells, ducts, and end apparatuses), except in the part of the gland proximal to the venom reservoir, where the secretory units resemble those around the venom reservoir. In the latter secretory units a funnel structure occurs between the duct (which is shorter than that of the secretory units of the gland) and the end apparatus. This funnel may be important in protecting the secretory cells around the reservoir from the cytolytic activity of the complex chemical mixture constituting the venom.

The efficiency of sucrose solution uptake by Melipona was compared to that of domesticated European Apis mellifera. Dynamics of nectar foraging were also recorded for 3 of the Melipona visiting the forest shrub, Hybanthus prunifolius (Violaceae). 1. Sugar concentration in nectar brought to nests averaged from 21 to 60% sugar for 15 colonies of M. fasciata, M. compressipes triplaridis, M. fuliginosa and M. marginata micheneri. Concentrations ranged from 19 to 72%, and all species collected nectars ranging at least between 24 and 63% sugar. However, M. compressipes and M. marginata preferred higher concentrations and foraged less on dilute nectars. Peak colony nectar harvest occured in late morning or early afternoon; peak pollen harvest was in early morning. 2. Imbibing rates of bees given 20, 30, 45, 60 or 70% sucrose solutions were highest at ≦45% sucrose, but caloric intake was most rapid at 60% sucrose for all species. All but M. marginata displayed greater net intake rates than domesticated European Apis mellifera. A foraging choice model incorporating caloric reward and imbibing rates of bees suggests M. compressipes and M. marginata should specialize on richer nectars. Rate of caloric intake per forager weight was higher for all Melipona (0.03-0.13g) than for A. mellifera (0.10 g). 3. The nectar of Hybanthus prunifolius (Violaceae), a shrub pollinated exclusively by Melipona, progressed from 35 to 60% sugar during the day. Bees foraged most when nectar was below 60% concentration, a pattern best explained as the result of intercolony competition and greater availability of lower quality nectar. 4. Sugar concentration in nectar harvested by colonies rose from lower to higher values through the day for Melipona. The increasing caloric reward of nectar is adaptive in exploiting foraging preferences of such bees. As standing nectar crop is depleted by competing bees, a gradual shift to more rewarding nectar should promote increased bee foraging range, more flower visits during a foraging trip, floral constancy, and genetic outcrossing. 5. The nectar load capacity of A. mellifera is greater than that of Melipona. Other factors being equal, Africanized A. mellifera, now a permanent resident of neotropical forests, should visit more flowers during a foraging trip. Additional species differences in foraging behavior are analyzed. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021539006

The applications were made by tractor‐mounted boom‐and‐nozzle equipment to small plots in Normandy, France. Before each application, bee hives were placed adjacent to the mustard plots and fitted with either a pollen trap or a dead‐bee trap. The application of both dose rates of WL‐85871 and phosalone resulted in no increase in bee mortalities and no discernible effect on pollen collection or long‐term hive development. In contrast, the application of MEP resulted in substantial bee mortalities, reduced pollen collection and adversely affected hive development. Both dose rates of WL‐85871 caused a sharp decline in foraging activity immediately after application, followed by a return to normal activity within a few hours. A prolonged gradual reduction in foraging activity occurred throughout the afternoon period after the phosalone application; with MEP, foraging activity fell rapidly to a very low level and remained so for the rest of that day and the following day. It was concluded that the ground application of WL‐85871 at 10 and 20 g a.i. ha−1 had no direct effect on honey bee survival and no observable effect on hive development.

While these effects, probably due to ATP depletion of the photoreceptor, are completely reversible after 5 minutes of reoxygenation, the photoreceptor remains less resistant to subsequent anoxia until the oxygen consumption, impaired following metabolic inhibition, is completely re-established.

Despite some overnight depletion by moths and other invertebrates, more nectar was present in flowers at dawn than at the preceding dusk. Significant nectar depletion occurred within a few hours after dawn, mainly due to foraging by two honeyeater species. Lichmera indistincta and Phylidonyris nigra. Thereafter, nectar availability was maintained at relatively low levels, principally because of foraging by honeyeaters and honey bees. Apis mellifera, that became active during the warmer part of the day. Although individual honeyeaters consumed more nectar than A. mellifera, honey bees were so abundant that their total impact was greater than that of either honeyeater species for much of the day. Transfer of C. quadrifidus pollen between flowers is necessary in order to achieve a high level of seed set, as the flowers appear to be protandrous.

Hairy col-letid bees (Leioproctus spp.) were observed on the flowers of 4 of 7 orchards in 1978–79, 6 of 9 in 1979–80, but none of 9 in 1980–81. However, their numbers were generally so low that, except in 1 orchard in 1978–79, and 2 in 1979–80, their effect on pollination was probably insignificant. Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) and other insects were too few to be of importance in the sites observed. Honey bee visitation to kiwifruit flowers in 1978–79 was reduced by competition from other pollen sources, which might explain the poor fruit size that season. Competition was minimal, and there was good bee visitation in 1979–80 (when fruit size was generally good) and in 1980–81 (when it was unsatisfactory). In 1980–81 there were more flowers and consequently more fruit, in all orchards compared with the 1979–80 season, and this physiological load probably caused some of the reduction in weight. In 1980–81, 32.7% of fruit weighed less than 72 g, even though fruit less than 93 g contained significantly more seed than in the previous 2 seasons. This suggested that pollination was satisfactory, but that adverse weather conditions may have retarded fruit growth. Even in poor seasons some orchards achieve excellent results, and in good seasons some orchards have very poor results, which suggests that factors such as position of male vines relative to females, cultural methods, and orchard microclimates may be important. © 1984 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Foraging patterns were studied using honey bees on artificial flower patches to determine if given individuals could change behaviours under differing conditions. 2. Two types of flower patches were used; those simulating a population of flowers, dimorphic for colour, and grids simulating a single colour‐dimorphic inflorescence. 3. In the simulated population of flowers bees were individually constant to colour over a range of reward volumes and flower patch sizes. 4. Each bee remained individually constant to a flower morph when visiting a population‐type grid but changed to random visitation on the simulated inflorescence. 5. On the simulated inflorescence, with morphs providing unequal qualities of reward, most bees foraged on the higher molarity morph. 6. Most, but not all bees, failed to minimize uncertainty on the simulated inflorescence. 7. On the simulated inflorescence, bees failed to optimize when one morph provided a greater reward volume than did the other. 8. In the population of flowers bees flew from flower to flower, whereas, they walked on the simulated inflorescence. Copyright © 1984, Wiley Blackwell.

In this bee species there is scarcely any damage, since the parasite is not able to reproduce in the worker brood. On the new host, Apis mellifera, however, the mite can multiply in both worker and drone brood. Varroa has caused extensive damage in some parts of Europe and South America, but there are no reports of colony deaths from tropical South America. During a period of four years we have examined the brood of infested colonies in Europe (West Germany), the Middle East (Turkey) and in tropical South America (Brazil). In a tropical climate the percentage of mites, which do not reproduce while in the sealed bee brood cell is nearly twice as high as in Europe, though the mites have existed for at least 10 years in both areas. It appears that climatic differences have an influence on the reproductive rate of Varroa mite. Reproduktion von Varroa jacobsoni O. in Europa, im Mittleren Osten und tropischen Südamerika Die Milbe Varroa jacobsoni O. parasitierte ursprünglich nur auf der Apis cerana. Bei dieser Bienenart kommt es kaum zu Schäden, da sich der Parasit nicht in der Arbeiterinnenbrut fortpflanzen kann. Auf seinem neuen Wirt, Apis mellifera, kann er sich dagegen sowohl in Drohnen‐ als auch in Arbeiterinnenbrut fortpflanzen. Die Varroa‐Milbe hat in einigen Teilen Europas und Südamerikas erhebliche Schäden verursacht, dagegen liegen keine Berichte über Völkerverluste aus dem tropischen Südamerika vor. Während eines Zeitraums von 4 Jahren haben wir die Brut von befallenen Völkern in Europa (Bundesrepublik Deutschland), im Mittleren Osten (Türkei) und im tropischen Südamerika (Brasilien) untersucht. Im tropischen Klima ist die Zahl der Milben, die sich während des Aufenthalts in den gedeckelten Brutzellen nicht fortpflanzen, etwa doppelt so hoch wie in Europa, obwohl die Milben in beiden Gebieten seit mindestens 10 Jahren vorkommen.

Only phospholipases A2 from N. n. atra, T. mucrosquamatus and A. mellifera venoms induced platelet aggregation with small amounts of 14C-serotonin release. They showed tachyphylaxis and also cross-tachyphylaxis in inducing platelet aggregation. The former two phospholipases A2 exhibited biphasic responses in which irreversible aggregations appeared at concentrations of 1 - 10 μg/ml. At higher concentrations, they elicited the reversible aggregation. Exogenous Ca2+ was essential to their activity. Indomethacin and EDTA completely abolished both phospholipase A2 induced platelet shape change and aggregation, while mepacrine, prostaglandin E1, verapamil and nitroprusside inhibited only the aggregation response. p-Bromophenacyl bromide-modified phospholipases A2, which almost completely lost enzymatic activity, failed to induce platelet aggregation. Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol inhibited the phospholipase A2-induced platelet aggregation. These phospholipases A2 induced thromboxane B2 formation which was inhibited by EDTA and indomethacin, but not by prostaglandin E1. Pre-treatment of platelet suspension with phospholipase A2 from N. n. atra or A. mellifera venom (50 μg/ml) inhibited platelet aggregation induced by sodium arachidonate or collagen, but not that induced by thrombin or ionophore A-23187. Exogenous sodium arachidonate or lysophosphatidylcholine also showed unaltered inhibitory spectrum on platelet aggregation. It is concluded that phospholipases A2 induce platelet aggregation by virtue of their enzymatic activity, cleaving the membrane phospholipids resulting in arachidonic acid release and formation of thromboxane A2. On the other hand, the cleaved products, lysophosphatidylcholine, arachidonic acid or arachidonate metabolites (via lipoxygenase pathway) may be responsible for anti-platelet activity. © 1984.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021200644

Temporal resolution of freely‐flying bees was measured by training bees, Apis mellifera (Linn.), to discriminate between a steady light and a flickering light. Two kinds of experiments were conducted: those using a homochromatic flicker, in which the intensity of the flickering light varied periodically with time; and ones using a heterochromatic flicker, in which the colour of the flickering light varied periodically. In either case, the time‐averaged properties (intensity and colour) of the flickering light matched those of the steady light, and the bees' ability to discriminate between the two stimuli was measured for various flicker frequencies. The results indicate that bees perform poorly in the homochromatic flicker experiments, regardless of the colour of the light (u.v., blue or green), but well in those with heterochromatic flicker. Heterochromatic flicker experiments using various pairwise combinations of the colours U.V., blue and green (corresponding to the three known spectral receptor‐types in the bee's retina) reveal that temporal resolution is much better when blue is one of the component colours, than when it is not. The simplest interpretation of the results is in terms of colour channels possessing different response speeds. Heterochromatic flicker promises to be a useful tool in investigating the temporal properties of colour vision in bees. Copyright © 1984, Wiley Blackwell.

A slightly more pronounced and prolonged decline in foraging activity occurred at the site treated with WL85871 at the higher dose rate.

For blowflies, it decreased markedly from 12·1 s at 14–15·5°C to 2·7 s at 26°C and above, largely because at low temperatures flies spent long periods quiescent or grooming rather than actively feeding.

The optic lobe shows restricted layers of 5‐HT‐immunoreactive fibers in the lamina and medulla organized perpendicular to the retinotopic elements. Immunoreactive fibers in the lobula represent invasions of protocerebral giant wide‐field neurons. The nonglomerular neuropil of the brain exhibits a meshwork of immunoreactive fibres invading glomerular neuropil of the mushroom bodies, central body complex, and antennal lobes. Mushroom body stalks and lobes contain immunoreactive fibers arranged perpendicular to the Kenyon cell fibers and matching subcompartments of these corpora pedunculata areas. The calyces are devoid of immunofluorescence. Serotonin‐positive fibres in the central body complex are arranged in its subcompartments. No 5‐HT immunoreactivity was found in the pons. Antennal glomeruli contain immunoreactive fibers restricted around the margin of the glomeruli. The selective mapping of 5‐HT‐immunoreactive neurons complements studies on the distribution of monoamine‐containing neurons in the bee brain. Serotonin‐ and catecholamine‐containing neurons often occur together in the same brain areas and subcompartments.

Brood areas, colony populations and weights of honey produced were measured. On the average, adult worker populations amounted to only 40-60% of the numbers that should have emerged, based on brood-cell estimates for the preceding 42-day period. Correlation coefficients (r) between numbers of brood and resulting numbers of adult bees varied from +0 20 to +086, and values of r for population and length of worker life from −0 39 to +092. Average length of productive life of workers varied from 21 to 25 days and average number of larvae reared per worker bee from 08 to 15. Workers rearing more brood were shorter-lived (r = −071 to −0 94). Individual colonies produced between 4 and 26 kg honey. Production was related in varying degree to number of brood reared (r = +0.20 to +0.85) and to colony population (r = +0 38 to +0 70). Individual productivity of workers had a greater influence than colony population on the amount of honey produced, as evidenced by the high coefficients of non-determination obtained for regression of weight of honey on population and the large standard deviations of the regression coefficients, as well as the highly significant values of χ2 for inter-colony comparisons of honey production per 1000 bees. Because of their higher brood production, colonies headed by queens 1 year old produced 19-27% more honey than those with queens 2 years old. It is concluded that honey production is governed by the interaction of 3 primary factors: average daily brood production, length of worker life and individual productivity of workers. The relative contributions of these factors vary. © 1984 International Bee Research Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845264387

Clairv. was studied in several wild populations near Swansea and in an experimental population to determine the extent of differences between the sexes in floral morphology, nectar production, and insect visits to flowers, and the effects of these differences on seed set. Male flowers are larger than female flowers and are borne more densely over a longer period. Male flowers have longer and more frequently white corona scales which may mimic the projecting white styles of female flowers. Male and female flowers were observed to secrete similar quantities of nectar sugar on the first morning of opening, but female flowers secreted more than males subsequently, and the total volumes of nectar secreted by female flowers were considerably greater. Male plants varied more than females in the total quantity of nectar sugar secreted per flower. Nectar concentration was nearly always greater in male flowers than in female flowers. Bumblebees, particularly Bombus hortorum (L.), B. pascuorum (Scop.) and B. terrestris (L.), were the most important visitors to the. flowers of S. dioica in the study sites, with some honeybees [Apis mellifera (L.)], butterflies (mainly Pieridae) and hoverflies (Syrphidae). Some visitors, including those that were most numerous at some sites, made most or all of their visits illegitimately. In the field in 1980 many visitors were observed to discriminate in favour of male flowers, which were much more numerous than female flowers. In the experimental population in 1981, many visitors discriminated in favour of female flowers, which were more numerous than in the field populations but were still substantially outnumbered by male flowers. Some individual bumblebees showed a change in preferences during the day, disciminating in favour of female flowers only during the afternoon, when the nectar resources available from female flowers were proportionately greater. The total numbers of visits that were observed to female and male flowers in the experimental population corresponded closely with the total quantities of nectar sugar available from each sex. The importance of the different insect visitors and of their discrimination between sexes in pollination is discussed. Seed set did not appear to be reduced by discrimination or insufficiency of pollinator visits in closely spaced plants, but was reduced in plants isolated by distances of 15 m or greater.

They prolonged in vitro recalcification time, partial thromboplastin time, plasma prothrombin time, stypven-cephalin clotting time and whole blood clotting time of rabbits. The venom PLA2 showed a more pronounced effect on plasma prothrombin time and whole blood clotting time, whereas melittin affected more markedly the stypvencephalin clotting time and partial thromboplastin time. The anticoagulant effect of the venom PLA2 or melittin was neutralized by thromboplastin, cephalin or ruptured platelets. The anticoagulant and enzymatic activities of the venom PLA2 were heat-stable in an acidic medium (pH: 5.6), but not in a neutral medium (pH: 7.4). The p-bromophenacyl bromide-modified PLA2, whose enzymatic activity decreased by more than 80%, lost anticoagulant activity markedly. Therefore, the PLA2 enzymatic activity contributes to its anticoagulant activity. The susceptibility of the anticoagulant activity of melittin to heat treatment was similar to that of PLA2. It is concluded that PLA2 and melittin exert their anticoagulant effect through the inactivation of phospholipids, which normally accelerate blood coagulation by forming complexes with blood coagulation factors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021058098

In addition, the concentration and distribution of biogenic amines in the brain of the bee have been determined using highly sensitive radioenzymatic techniques and high performance liquid chromatography. The cerebral ganglia of the bee contain similar amounts of dopamine and serotonin, more dopamine than octopamine, and very low levels of nor adrenaline. Slow fading green fluorescence, typical of catecholamines, was located throughout the cerebral ganglia, and was particularly intense in the central body and mushroom body neuropils. Results indicate that the fluorescence in the mushroom body neuropils is largely extrinsic in origin. Both dopamine and serotonin were detected in the calyces and α-lobe of the mushroom bodies, and in the antennal lobe. In the optic lobe, however, serotonin was found, but only low levels of dopamine were detected. Slow fading green fluorescence was replaced in the optic lobes by fluorescence which faded rapidly in the excitation light. The non-fluorogenic amine octopamine was found in the mushroom bodies and in the neuropils of the optic lobes, with the largest amounts of octopamine in the optic lobes associated with the neuropil of the medulla. The possibility that intrinsic neurones of the mushroom body neuropil are octopaminergic is discussed. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.","Biogenic amines; Glyoxylic acid; Honeybee brain; Insect neuroanatomy; Radioenzymatic assay",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021090580

The Na+ pump derives its energy from ATP, splitting it into ADP and Pi, and it has reasonably been proposed that the changes in concentrations of ATP, ADP and Pi lead to a stimulation of the O2 consumption by the mitochondria and hence to a restoration of the stock of ATP1-3. Here we present evidence suggesting that Qo2<sub/> must be controlled differently in the retinal photoreceptor cells of the honeybee drone. Stimulation of drone photoreceptors with a flash of light causes an entry of Na+ (ref. 4) and a transient increase in Qo2<sub/> that indicates respiration of the right order of magnitude to provide ATP to pump the Na+ out5. We report intracellular recordings of changes in intracellular sodium (Nai +) and potassium (Ki +) in response to single light flashes and have compared the time course of extra oxygen consumption (ΔQo2<sub/>) with these ion changes and other indices of Na+ pumping. We found that the time course of pumping seems to lag behind the time course of ΔQo2<sub/>.

Although only 40-60% of the ovules mature into seeds, hand-pollination experiments conducted in several populations over four years provided little evidence that reproductive success in this species was limited by pollination. Both honeybeess (Apis mellifera) and two small species of native andrenid bees effectively pollinate E. umbilicatum, as determined by measurements of seed set and counts of pollen tubes in the styles of flowers kept under cages and allowed a single visit. Full pollination of E. umbilicatum is promoted by: (1) large amounts of nectar and pollen that attract a variety of potential pollinators, (2) the small (2-3) number of visits required to fertilize all of a flower's ovules, (3) extended perianth persistence of unpollinated flowers. The latter two traits are also characteristic of other spring wildflowers and may contribute to fitness in a habitat where both physical factors and competition between plants for floral visitors can make pollinator service unpredictable. Causes of the observed deficiency in seed set in E. umbilicatum are complex and probably involve cold weather, low light levels or other unidentified physical factors, genotypes of pollen parents (i.e. quality of pollination), and diversion of resources from current year's seed set to future reproduction. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020925887

Three receptor cells have unbranched sensory cilia, containing densely packed microtubules, which extend distally into the cuticular apparatus and completely fill its cavity. These connecting cilia are of the usual 9+0 type. The fourth receptor, if present, has a thin sensory cilium which terminates beneath the cuticular apparatus. Its connecting cilium has armed outer doublets. The outer cavity is formed by two enveloping cells and is completely sealed off. Lipid deposits are present within the cavity and the tormogen cell. The thecogen cell has scolopale rod-like structures around the inner cavity. Features common to the insect hygro- and thermoreceptive sensilla are discussed in comparison with those of other insects. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.","Honey bee; Hygroreception; Insect; Sensillum; Thermoreception",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020685878

It was thought that old weak winter bees had succumbed to a preparation otherwise innocuous. Extensive tests to reveal any links between the bees' physiological condition and pesticide sensitivity involved 6 hormone herbicides, 11 fungicides and 2 insecticides, all approved harmless for bees and functioning on them wholly or mainly as stomach poisons. As a rule bee sensitivity was measured as LD 50 per os, in smaller tests as percentage mortality. Amount and quality of pollen ingested in the first days of life affected the pesticide sensitivity of young and older bees. Bees fed adequate high quality pollen are less sensitive than counterparts fed inadequate or inferior pollen or pollen substitute; such differences persisted if the LD 50 was calculated for the same body weight. Pesticides containing manganese are an exception. To these, bees fed inadequate pollen are no more or even less sensitive than comparable well-fed bees. Pesticide sensitivity decreases generally from early to late summer. Quality of pollen available for larvae has no effect on poison sensitivity of imagines. Food supply conditions however exert a clear influence: tested with the same pesticides, hive bees from colonies having had a rich early food supply, and young bees bred then, are less sensitive than their counterparts having had moderate or no early food supply. Poison sensitivity of summer bees increases with age; most sensitive are old winter bees which had practiced broodcare in early spring. Inadequate pollen intake can be regarded as causing protein deficiency. Investigation of this in mammals and man indicate that the higher poison sensitivity in bees results from inhibition of the enzymatic decomposition of pesticides. For practical bee protection it is important that all organic fungicides tested are effectively harmless. Hormone hebicides can be ranked as practically harmless even for bees inadequately protein-fed, as long as the approved concentrations are observed. Our tests raised doubts however about the registration as harmless for bees of insecticides based on Endosulfan and Phosalon. Of interest in practice and for the official testing of pesticides are also the high pesticide sensitivity of old winter bees, the decrease in sensitivity of bees on a stable feed from early to late summer, and the sensitivity-reducing influence of pollen-rich food supply promoting development. It is important ecologically that pollens of different plant species vary in nutrient quality for the honey bee: there are perfectly worthless (conifers), poor-to-medium, and highly effective pollen types. As shown in this paper, these differences are relevant not only for the development of the physiological condition and breeding potential of the bee, but also for pesticide sensitivity. That bees gather worthless and poor-quality, sometimes even poisonous, pollen (some Ranunculus sp.) is evidently due to the phagostimulant present in all pollen types. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020924071

When the [K+] in the superfusate was abruptly increased from 3.2 mM to 17.9 mM both photoreceptors and glial cells depolarized. The time course of the depolarization of the photoreceptors was slower with increasing depth from the surface. Half time of depolarization was plotted against depth: this graph was compatible with the arrival of K+ being exclusively by diffusion through the extracellular clefts. However, as we then showed, this interpretation is inadequate. The time course of depolarization of the glial cells was almost the same at all depths. This indicates that they are electrically coupled. Consequently, current‐mediated K+ flux (spatial buffering) through glial cells will contribute to the transport of K+ through the tissue: K+ ions enter the glial syncytium in the region of high external potassium concentration, [K+]0, and an equivalent quantity of K+ ions leave in regions of low [K+]0. Intracellular K+ activity (aiK) was measured with double‐barrelled K+‐sensitive micro‐electrodes in slices of retina superfused on both faces. When [K+] in the superfusate was increased from 7.5 mM to 17.9 mM an increase in aiK was observed in glial cells at all depths in the slice (initial rate 1.7 mM min‐1, S.E. of the mean = 0.2 mM min‐1), but there was little increase in the photoreceptors (0.3 +/‐ 0.2 mM min‐1). The increase in aiK in glial cells near the centre of the slice could not have been caused by spatial buffering; it presumably resulted from net uptake. We conclude that when [K+] is increased at the surface of this tissue, the build up of K+ in the extracellular clefts depends on extracellular diffusion, spatial buffering and net uptake. The latter two processes, which have opposing effects, involve about 10 times as much K+ as the first.

Individual bees were offered a choice of artificial flowers, each containing either 20% or 40% sucrose solution, in either low or high flower density situations. From May to September an increase in flower density did not result in any statistically significant increase in preference for the 40% sucrose solution, whereas in October and November it did, as predicted qualitatively in models of optimal foraging theory. It was suggested that foraging selectivity is affected by the colony need for water, which is used for nest temperature regulation and for preparation of larval food. To test this hypothesis, we sprayed water into the beehive in September, there-by reducing drastically the colony need for water. After water had been sprayed, the bees foraged for the 40% sucrose solution more selectively in a high density situation than in a low density situation, whereas before spraying, this density effect had not been demonstrated. The foraging selectivity in honey-bees is discussed as a compromise between two conflicting colony needs: one for sugar, and one for water. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020859528

In Apis mellifera, the structure of cytochrome c is identical in the larval and adult stages. No immunologically crossreactive precursors or isoenzymes are present in larvae. Total body cytochrome c of individual animals can thus be measured by viroimmunoassay. 2. 2. Cytochrome c was used as an indicator for the respiratory capacity of the mitochondrial mass. Its concentration is 2-3.5-fold higher in queen larvae than in workers, with a maximal difference in the spinning larval stage. Cytochrome c concentration and respiration are directly correlated. It is concluded that, as a response to caste determination, respiratory rates in larvae are regulated by adaptive concentration changes in respiratory chain enzymes, as postulated for long-term adaptations by the near equilibrium hypothesis. 3. 3. A mathematical relationship exists between O2-consumption (R), cytochrome c content (cyt. c) and and body weight (W), the product R·log cyt c being proportional to W. R·log cyt c being proportional to W. 4. 4. For queens and workers reared in the colony, this proportionality is caste-specific and permits the definition of a caste factor C = R·log cyt c/W. The resp. values found are Cqueen = 3.78 and Cworker = 0.62. 5. 5. The caste factor is a biochemical probe for queen determination.

Heritability is then estimated by dividing the intraclass correlation of the character by the relatedness among the workers within colonies. Estimates obtained by this method are shown to be considerably less biased than those obtained by analysing data from single-drone inseminations because of the contribution of dominance variance to the covariance of sib workers.

In a series of experiments on the nature of the US, eliminating the proboscis component was found to lower the asymptotic level of performance, whereas eliminating the antennal component was without effect; reducing the concentration of sucrose from 20% to 7% slowed acquisition but did not lower the asymptotic level of performance; and second-order conditioning was demonstrated.

We have investigated the influence of microclimates characteristic of breeding and broodless areas on the juvenile hormone titre in the haemolymph and whole body extracts, on the corpora allata in vitro activity, on the degradation of juvenile hormone and on the dry weight of the hypopharyngeal glands using bees of known ages. A microclimate of 35°C and 1.5% CO2, as observed in the breeding area, induces a rapid and pronounced increase in the juvenile hormone titre. On the other hand, this titre remains low in bees kept at 27°C and 1.5% CO2, a microclimate associated with broodless combs. Rates of juvenile hormone synthesis by corpora allata in vitro were found to be extremely low, even in the presence of farnesenic acid, and not related to the juvenile hormone titre. In vitro incubation of juvenile hormone in haemolymph revealed no degradation while injected juvenile hormone was found to be degraded and taken up by the gut at rates only weakly correlated with the juvenile hormone titre.

Niche breadth estimates for populations of A. syriaca were comparatively low (0.09-0.27); Bombus griseocollis and the introduced honeybee Apis mellifera were the most common visitors. Niche breadths were greater, implying less specialization, for A. incarnata (mean 0.30) and A. verticillata (mean 0.39). Paper wasps (Polistes) and digger wasps (Sphex) were numerous and effective pollinators of A. verticillata, but bumblebees comprised the largest proportion (27%) of pollinators at some sites. Similarly, utilization of pollinators by A. incarnata was highly dependent on the locality of the population studied, with Sphex pennsylvanicus, Apis mellifera, Bombus griseocollis and Xylocopa virginica constituting the most abundant pollinators. Intraspecific comparisons of the similarity of pollinators among populations of A. syriaca gave values that were higher than corresponding values for different species within a locality, implying possible niche differentiation with respect to this species. However, a hypothesis of pollinator partitioning among species was not accepted for A. incarnata and A. verticillata.

Honey bees Apis mellifera concentrated on different flower species than did native bees. Spring-flying native bees included many species adapted to forage on native flower species that bloom before the tree canopy closes. Apis mellifera outcompeted native bees at large clusters of attractive flower species such as apple and the crucifer Barbarea vulgaris. Halictus ligatus was the most common early summer halictine. This species concentrated its foraging on different flowers than did other early summer bees, probably because of differences in innate flower preferences. A profuse bloom of native goldenrods Solidago in late summer was the seasonal peak of resource abundance. Native bees must complete their seasonal cycles and enter diapause before the killing frost. They therefore foraged on early-blooming goldenrod species such as S. juncea. In contrast, honey bees overwinter as active bees within their hives. They were most common on later-blooming goldenrods, where they collected much of the nectar required for overwintering. Competition among foraging bees was probably most important in the spring at this site. Partitioning of flower species and differences in seasonal flight times resulted primarily from differences in innate flower preferences, number of generations per season, and means of overwintering.-Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021032212

In each case the venom sac extract contained all of the proteins detected in the fresh venom plus numerous additional proteins which are probably sac components. Yellow jacket and bee (Apis mellifera) proteins were extracted from the gels and tested for IgE binding activity using pooled sera from RAST-positive individuals. Significant IgE binding activity was found for the five known bee allergens and for the major yellow jacket venom proteins.

No consistent differences were found between pollinators. In two experiments, fly pollination gave significantly higher yields than bee pollination but in the third, bee pollination gave slightly more seed. Crossing between cultivars, assessed by progeny testing on one cultivar, varied between 22‐7 and 55‐9%. Differences in crossing level attributable to the pollinators were not consistent and were not or only just statistically significant, but there were significant and substantial differences between the experiments themselves. Where more umbels were produced by the red‐bulbed cultivar than by the yellow, higher crossing levels were found in the yellow cultivar. The highest crossing levels were found in the only experiment where insects were not introduced until peak flowering time, but where seed yield was comparatively low. Crossing levels were lowest where the umbel numbers were approximately equal. Individual umbels studied showed that while seed set was usually heaviest at and just before the mid‐flowering date, this period could correspond with the lowest levels of crossing during the flowering period, particularly if flowering of the two cultivars was not completely synchronous. In field plots, approximately 75% of crossed seeds sown survived to give harvestable bulbs, but fewer than 50% of selfed seeds did so. In an experiment in which crossing levels from different pollinators were similar but survival levels differed significantly, it was deduced that bees performed more crossing within a cultivar than flies.

To measure ΔQo2(t), the change in Qo2 from its level in darkness, the transients of the partial pressure of O2 (Po2) were recorded with O2 microelectrodes simultaneously in two sites in the slice and ΔQo2 was calculated by a computer using Fourier transforms. After a 40-ms flash of intense light, ΔQo2 reached a peak of 40 µl O2/g · min and then declined exponentially to the baseline with a time constant τ1 = 4.96 ± 0.49 s (SD, n = 10). The rising phase was characterized by a time constant τ2 = 1.90 ± 0.35 s (SD, n = 10). The peak amplitude of ΔQo2 increased linearly with the log of the light intensity. Replacement of Na+ by choline, known to decrease greatly the light-induced transmembrane current, caused a 63% decrease of ΔQo2. With these changes, however, the kinetics of ΔQo2(t) were unchanged. This suggested that the recovery phase is rate-limited by a single reaction with apparent first-order kinetics. Evidence is provided that suggests that this reaction may be the working of the sodium pump. Exposure of the retina to high concentrations of ouabain or strophanthidin (inhibitors of the sodium pump) reduced the peak amplitude of ΔQo2 by ~80% and increased τ1. The increase of τ1 was an exponential function of the time of exposure to the cardioactive steroids. Hence, it seems likely that the greatest part of ΔQo2 is used for the working of the pump, whose activity is the mechanism underlying the rate constant of the descending limb of ΔQo2(t). © 1982, Rockefeller University Press., All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0019995292

Over a fortnight period interindividual differences with respect to the nature of trophallactic activity become prominent: some workers turn out to be ""asking"" individuals while others tend to specialize in offering. The nature of a workers' trophallactic activity is correlated with the trophallactic treatment she receives from her associates.

Africanized workers began foraging at earlier ages than European workers in colonies of their own races, but cross-fostered workers began foraging at the same age as workers in the colonies in which they were placed. Some differences in the mean time spent foraging per hour and the mean number of flights per hour were also found. The results suggest two major factors determining differences in division of labor between Africanized and European bees: 1) the colony characteristics by which foraging age is determined, and 2) the responses of individual workers to hive environment. A hypothesis to explain these results is presented based on higher levels of foraging stimuli in Africanized colonies as well as a higher stimulus threshold for Africanized workers. © 1982 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001467775

Bee venom, 2mg · kg-1 · day-1 for 24 days, suppressed but did not abolish the primary and secondary inflammatory responses to the adjuvant as monitored by decreases in the swelling of the left and right hind paws respectively. Bee venom itself caused no swelling of the hind paws. The effects of bee venom and adjuvant-induced arthritis on heme metabolism were also examined. Bee venom or adjuvant had no effect on hepatic δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase, porphyrin content, or ferrochelatase activity. However, with both treatments cytochrome P-450 and the associated enzymic activities of ethylmorphine N-demethylase and benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase were depressed markedly. In contrast, both treatments caused several-fold enhancement of hepatic microsomal heme oxygenase activity. Adjuvant-treated rats receiving bee venom showed changes in heme metabolism which were of a magnitude similar to those observed when either agent was administered to the experimental animals. Although the bee venom appears to suppress adjuvant-induced arthritis to a greater extent in female than in male rats, the alterations in heme metabolism were similar in bee venom-treated male and female rats.

Populations of honey bees held at a constant temperature for 24-48 h exhibited diurnal rhythms of metabolic rate (MR) and locomotor activity with peaks during the day and lows at night. The amplitude of the metabolic rhythm decreased as air temperature (Tin) increased. 2. Thermoregulatory behaviors including clustering and fanning occurred in cycles which correlated with the diurnal rhythms of MR and activity. 3. At cold air temperature (10°C), a high rate of thermoregulatory heat production was independent of visible activity, and conversely, at high air temperatures (40°C), MR was low despite increased locomotor activity. 4. Decreasing air temperature from 30 to 10°C day and night resulted in clustering, and metabolic increases proportional to the degree of cooling. Raising air temperature from 30 to 40°C day and night caused a drop in metabolic rate, an increase in locomotor activity, and fanning. 5. Day/night differences in thermoregulatory responses to cooling included a nocturnal reduction of the threshold air temperature for thermogenesis and a decrease in the slopes of the metabolic response curves below this threshold. At 10°C there was more clustering at night than during the day. 6. The presence of capped brood moderates these responses in a quantitative manner, as indicated by the greater metabolic rate when the bee/brood ratio is small and the greater amount of clustering on brood comb than on broodless comb. 7. At cold air temperatures (10°C), capped brood temperature is maintained above 30°C through the combined effects of clustering and thermogenesis.

Immediately after visiting cells containing immature queens, workers of Apis mellifera L. were observed to engage in prolonged cleaning, particularly of their tongues when they had visited larvae, and of their antennae when they had visited pupae. Thereafter other workers usually initiated and made antennal contacts with them. During such antennal contact the bee that had visited the queen larva often donated food. The implication of these findings on the distribution of pheromone produced by immature queens is discussed. Workers were stimulated to make antennal contact with the excised heads of bees from a queen's court, providing further evidence that queen pheromone is transferred between workers' antennae.

The honey bees collect nectar and pollen from the shorter inner whorl of stamens and from the lowermost part of the funnel‐shaped perianth tube. The hover flies visit mainly the appendages on the outer perigone and the longer stamen whorl. These appendages were found to secrete a sugar solution as well as polysaccharides and lipids. The latter probably attract the flies. It is suggested that each pollinator is attracted by a different nectary type and that the modes of pollination prevent competition between the different pollinators and are to be interpreted as maximizing the floral attraction in the harsh season of flowering (September to December).

Bumblebees, particularly Bombus lapidarius, were the most abundant visitors to most of these plant species; Apis mellifera, some Lepidoptera and Syrphidae were of lesser importance. Some insect species differed in the flowers they visited most frequently. In the early-flowering groups of plants there was some specialization from different pollinators and divergences in flowering time, suggesting that competition for pollinators or avoidance of interspecific pollen transfer has exerted selection pressure in the past. In the late-summer group all species overlapped considerably in flowering time and their insect visitors, which suggests that there has not been any strong selection against an overlap. There appeared to be a saturation of insect visitors in late summer, with particularly large numbers of B. lapidarius.-from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020409679

Forty‐six of the 56 species have small flowers (log length (mm) × log breadth (mm) 1). Thirty‐six are hermaphrodite, 12 dioecious and eight dioecious, monoecious or polygamous. Compatibility tests showed that five (possible seven) of the hermaphrodite species are self‐compatible, one hermaphrodite species is probably self‐incompatible. Anthesis and individual flower duration are variable within and between species. There is some interspecific temporal separation of flowering over the year, but a peak of species in flower in the drier to early wet season. Pollination syndromes were also studied. Of the 23 important species, 20 are generalist, two wind‐pollinated, one bird‐pollinated. For all species, 46 are generalist, six wind‐pollinated, one, perhaps two, bird‐pollinated, and possibly two moth‐pollinated. Generalist type flowers are visited by a wide range of potential pollinators and one pollinator, Apis mellifera, visits many different flowers. Dispersal units usually weigh between 10 and 1000 mg, the others are smaller. Of the 23 important species, 18 are adapted for bird dispersal, four for wind dispersal, and one lacks obvious adaptation. For all 56 species 46 are bird‐dispersed, eight wind‐dispersed, one is ectochoric and one lacks obvious adaptation. Fruiting phenology is markedly seasonal, occurring from June to January, spanning the later drier period and half of the wet season. With one common type of pollination—entomophily, one common type of dispersal—by birds, and little temporal separation over the year in time of flower and fruit production, there seems to be only a small amount of niche separation in the variables studied; and thus the coexistence of many species is not explained by the present observations.

The measurements of Yes'kov & Sapozhnikov (1976) suggest that electrostatic potentials on foraging honeybees can reach hundreds of volts. Pollen grains of oilseed rape, Brassica napus L., subjected experimentally to potentials of this order, jumped a distance that increased approximately as the square of the voltage, between two pin electrodes on which, in some experiments, were impaled an anther or stigma of oilseed rape or a freshly‐killed honeybee. Most floral surfaces were insulated, but there was a low‐impedance path to earth via the stigma, and the electrostatic field due to an approaching charged bee must therefore concentrate there. Thus, if electrostatic potentials of this magnitude occur in nature they may increase the chance that pollen from bees will reach the stigma rather than other floral surfaces, as well as enabling pollen to jump from anther to bee and from bee to stigma across an air gap of the order of 0.5 mm.

The horizontal motion‐detecting system controlling optomotor head‐turning behaviour in honeybees, Apis mellifera, was found to be partitioned into two separate subsystems. Each subsystem is direction‐specific such that visual stimulation in the preferred direction elicited a high level of responses that correcly followed the movement, whereas stimulation in the non‐preferred direction resulted in response levels comparable to or lower than those for blinded controls. The results indicate that medial eye regions are specialized for the detection of posterior‐to‐anterior movements and lateral regions are specialized for detecting anterior‐to‐posterior motion. A model suggesting possible neural correlates for this functional subdivision of the optomotor response is proposed. Copyright © 1982, Wiley Blackwell.

Experiments with captive birds showed that E. tenax are very palatable, although they may be avoided if given after honeybees. Thus the mimicry is of the Batesian variety.Both model and mimic vary in colour pattern. Although the phenotypic variation is continuous, in both species it is also bimodal owing to genetic polymorphisms which are modified by other factors. In north-west England the overall percentage of “light” patterns was roughly 50 per cent, both in the model and in the mimic. Pattern frequencies in E. tenax were fairly consistent between samples, as expected for a highly mobile species, but honeybees showed local fluctuations. In spring, E. tenax was less variable, and much less numerous, than it was in autumn.Although similar in colour, the markings on the abdomens of the two species differ in shape. Possible reasons why Eristalis tenax has not evolved a more exact resemblance to Apis mellifera are that the modified patterns derive some added protection from a partial mimicry of wasps, and that they are more effective in temperature regulation. © 1982 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0003160203

Phospholipase A2 initially caused an increase of synaptosome respiration and subsequently inhibited their oxygen uptake, but this effect was completely abolished in BSA‐containing media. The classical uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, DNP, produced release of 45Ca or [3H]GABA from superfused synaptosomes previously loaded with radioactive calcium or GABA. The treatment of synaptosomes with phospholipase A2 had no effect on the spontaneous efflux of 45Ca or [3H]GABA. However, depolarization‐dependent release of [3H]GABA from synaptosomes treated with phospholipase A2 was significantly inhibited. We suggest that the inhibition of depolarization‐dependent influx of 45Ca into synaptosomes treated with phospholipase A2 may be attributed to the lesion of the specific function of plasma membrane rather than to the impairment of the calcium‐sequestrating function of intraterminal structures.

The neurons were identified using intracellular dye injection (Lucifer yellow). The responses of L-(large) neurons can vary. They range from transient graded hyperpolarizations in response to light-On and -Off, (sometimes accompanied by tonic hyperpolarization during the light stimulus), to spontaneous tonic action potentials which are inhibited by light. Some neurons show both hyperpolarizations and action potentials. The varying responses to light stimuli are dependent only on the state of the L-neuron and are not correlated systematically with particular types of L-neurons. The experiments demonstrate that the action potentials are generated within the L-neurons and are not conducted antidromically from other neurons. The amplitude and frequency of the action potentials depend on the membrane potential of the L-neuron. With light stimulation, or application of hyperpolarizing current, spikes can be generated within some of the L-neurons. Presumably non-spiking L-neurons are refractory due to maintained depolarization. They have membrane potentials of about -40 mV. Action potentials in L-neurons were recorded only with high resistance microelectrodes. The vitality of the animal can not be correlated with the occurrence of spikes. Functional significance of spontaneous tonic spike discharges in L-neurons is discussed in the context of behavioural experiments in the bee. It is possible, that a given L-neuron uses either spiking or non-spiking signal transmission depending on the behavioural situation. Although very fine microcapillary electrodes were used, no successful recordings or stainings of S-(small) neurons in the ocellar nerve were achieved. Therefore, results of non-identified ocellar interneurons which have been attributed to S-neurons should be critically reviewed. © 1981 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33749356166

When honey was placed on a few flowers, visitation was stimulated. The honey bee tore and chewed at the anther cone to collect pollen, while B. fervidus probed for nectar which was not present.

Dark adapted honeybees (Apis mellifera camica) were trained in a T-maze to discriminate spectral light stimuli (λ=533, 430, and 413 nm) from dark or from an achromatic white light stimulus. 2. Bees trained to discriminate a spectral stimulus from an equally bright white light respond to the spectral stimulus as if it were the white stimulus within a certain range of intensities. This range lies between the threshold for detection of light (the achromatic threshold) and that for determination of color (the chromatic threshold); it is termed the achromatic interval. Thus the detection of spectral stimuli has two thresholds; a lower one for the absolute detection of the stimulus and a higher one for the perception of color hue. The achromatic interval for wavelengths λ=533, 430, and 413 nm is≃1.5 log10 units of light intensity. 3. Trained responses to spectral stimuli disappear at high stimulus intensities. Also, bees can not be trained to spectral lights of high intensity (&gt;2 log10 intensity units above color vision threshold). This bright light effect is attributed to the specific response function of the lamina monopolar cells. 4. Achromatic vision is explicable in terms of known characteristics of receptor and neural organization in the bee color vision system. It is concluded that bees pool output of all receptors from a single ommatidium in a neural strategy which produces an achromatic signal. Bees use this neurally derived achromatic signal for orientation at light intensities near visual threshold. © 1981 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001400216

A system is described in which a behavioral test is used to match color shades to an arbitrarily chosen level to the compound of brightness and saturation. This system was used with honeybees (Apis mellifera carnica) to develop a series of color marks which were equal to the compound of brightness and color saturation to bees. 2. Freely flying honeybees were trained to a blue color mark on a vertical screen. Discrimination of this blue color from violet, green, blue-green and yellow was tested at various natural luminances. In the majority of the experiments the background screen was painted achromatic grey of the same luminosity as the color marks. Two training procedures were used: one utilized a feeding station, the other the hive entrance. 3. Bees discriminate colors best at luminances between 101 and 102 cd/m2. Color discrimination is less acute at both higher and lower luminance levels; these deficits at high and low luminances have been termed the bright light and dim light effects, respectively. Color discrimination disappears below 10-1 cd/m2 (Fig. 6). The dependence of color discrimination on available light is the same in both the violet and blue-green regions. 4. It is concluded that bees have achromatic vision at low light levels (&lt;10-1 cd/m2), and that they can use this achromatic vision during extreme low light situations - even during flight orientation. The bright light effect is discussed with respect to results from single unit electrophysiological recording experiments and appears to result from the specific behavior of light adaptation in the retinula cell - monopolar cell system. The narrow luminance band of optimum color discrimination suggests that color discrimination may be better than previously determined using selfruminant spectral lights (von Heiversen 1972a). © 1981 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3543011661

Construction of queen cups was induced experimentally in overcrowded queenright colonies, during winter, which is a non-swarming season. This construction was induced by high population density of bee workers: above a threshold of 2.3 bee workers/ml there was a relationship between the number of cups constructed and the colony density. During the swarming season a relationship was established between the free volume of a hive (population density) and the number of queen cups constructed: 1.5 cups in a colony that occupied 80,960 ml, compared with 77 cups in a colony hived within a volume of 20, 240 ml. Observations of the queen's movements upon combs in colonies of high and normal population densities showed that in an overcrowded colony the queen bee was almost absent from the bottom edges of the comb, where queen swarming cups and cells are constructed. The tarsal glands of queens are located in the fifth tarsomere and the glandular oily secretion is deposited by the foot-pads upon the combs surface. The rate of secretion by the queen's tarsal glands was about 13 times higher than by those of the workers. A bioassay for testing the inhibitory effects of the queen's glandular extracts on the construction of queen cups was developed. It was based on increasing worker bee population densities, and can be used effectively throughout the year in a subtropical climate. The application of tarsal and mandibular glands' secretion to comb bottom edges in overcrowded colonies (bioassay) caused the inhibition of queen cup construction. None of these two secretions affected construction of these cups when applied separately. We presume that due to colony overcrowding the queen bee is unable to deposit the non-volatile secretions from tarsal glands along the comb edges and that the deficiency of the foot-print pheromone triggers the construction of swarming cups along the non-inhibited areas. © 1981.","Apis mellifera; construction; foot-print pheromone; honey bees; inhibition; Queen bee; queen-cups; swarming; tarsal glands",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000772084

The optomotor head‐turning response of the honeybee (Apis mellifera) to a horizontally moving stripe pattern was analysed after occlusion of specific regions of the compound eye. The dorsal half of the eye and the medial region appear to be irrelevant to this behavioural reflex. Occlusion of the ventrolateral portion of the eye, however, even with the remainder of the eye unoccluded, rendered the optomotor system blind. The optomotor response was found to be mediated by an area roughly equal to one‐fifth of the total eye surface with some redundancy in the system, since occlusion of at least half of the zone did not significantly impair the response. These results support the hypothesis of physically separate visual subsystems in the bee eye which are adapted for different functions. Copyright © 1981, Wiley Blackwell.

To test the colour pattern hypothesis of E-vector orientation in the honeybee (van der Glas, 1975) menotactic orientation to unpolarized overhead patterns, in which the colours blend in a gradual transition from one to the other (Fig. 2; stimulus field: 17.7°), has been studied by observation of bees dancing on a horizontal comb. 2. When the patterns are of colours of short wavelength, dances are well oriented with relatively small variance but the angle between the indicated feeding place and the sun's bearing is usually transposed by 180° (Fig. 11). Therefore an unpolarized colour pattern evokes directional dances specifically oriented as if the pattern provided a clue to the sun's bearing. 3. In contrast, when the patterns are made up of bee white (including UV) of different brightness levels (with gradual transition between ""light"" and ""dark""), dance orientation is poor. Hence orientation to the coloured patterns cannot be just a response to brightness or a result of differential stimulation of R9 or the other UV receptors in different overhead areas independent of other receptor types. 4. Evidence is given that the oriented response to the experimental overhead short wavelength colour patterns does not indicate that natural colour- and UV patterns in the sky are used. 5. The fact that bees do orientate to unpolarized colour patterns along with previous data on integrational processes between different types of spectral receptors in E-perception (van der Glas, 1975, 1976), are consistent with a perception mechanism for sky polarization by means of colour coding. On the other hand, the result of the bees' transposition by 180° of the angle between the indicated feeding place and the sun's bearing cannot yet be finally interpreted with any current model for celestial orientation. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250249589

The unconditioned antennal movement towards the midline of the head in response to a sugar-water stimulus to one antenna becomes a conditioned response with the stripe movement as the conditioned stimulus. Bees can be conditioned to the ventral to dorsal movement of the stripe pattern. Conditioning to the dorsal to ventral direction leads to an increase of the reaction to ventral-dorsal movement (Fig. 2). A number of bees already responds with significant antennal movements to the moving stripe stimulus in the ventro-dorsal plane of motion before conditioning. These bees cannot be conditioned to the visual stimulus (Fig. 3A). The conditioned reaction is extinct after about 5 tests without a reward (Fig. 3B). No specific conditioning effects can be shown for the anterior to posterior direction of stripe movement (Fig. 4).

The effect of gravity was tested in natural and artificial cells by changing their inclination and by rotation experiments. In queen larvae ultimate orientation (final orientation at the outset of metamorphosis) is controlled by gravity. They display a positive geotaxis under all experimental conditions tested even in reversed natural cells. However, ultimate orientation of worker larvae in natural cells is not affected by gravity. A positive geotactic preference is shown only in long artificial cells whereas larvae in short cells respond indifferently to gravity. The texture of the cell ending has a directing effect. The geotactic indifference is replaced by a positive geotaxis in worker larvae treated with JH-I or JH-III during the third day of larval development (Fig. 5). In JH-treated larvae the evaluation of gravity equals that of queen larvae (Fig. 7). A positive geotaxis is evoked even in individuals that develop rather weak adult queenlike characteristics (Table 2).

Production is subject to modifying influences, primarily in relation to age and behaviour; thus the supply of secretory materials in the colony is affected. Accordingly, an examination of the protein pattern in swarming bees was included in the study. By examining individual proteins with special experimental techniques, the composition of the electrophoretic zones was shown to be heterogeneous and dependent on age. Dependence on age was followed qualitatively using acid phosphatase, nonspecific esterase and sucrase activity. Two-dimensional separation of the proteins of the hypopharyngeal glands showed an age-related pattern of subfractions which was correlated with the two phases of glandular function. Some of the proteins, which undoubtedly are important in the second period of life of the worker bee when it is gathering nectar, are already being produced in bees of nursing age. Production is intensified in swarming bees. A comparison of the patterns of hypopharyngeal gland proteins with those of royal jelly showed that forager-specific proteins were not detectable in the secretory product of nurse bees. The significance of this conclusion relative to a possible secretory mechanism is discussed. © 1980 Masson.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002450233

The main result is the following relationship between the differential sensitivity and the equivalence curve as defined by cross modality matching. The bee treats two discs, which differ from a reference disc in diameter or in degree of greyness, as equivalent when both differ from the reference disc by an equal number of Δ-intervals (Fig. 6).

The major component of the cuticular lipids is hydrocarbon, which comprises 58% of this wax. In contrast, hydrocarbon comprises only 13-17% of the comb wax, and monoester is the largest component (Tulloch 1971). The major fractions of the cuticular wax were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography, and were shown to be qualitatively similar to those of the comb wax. The incorporation of injected radio-labelled acetate into hexane extractable wax by worker honeybees not actively producing comb wax resulted in the recovery of much of the radioactivity in the hydrocarbon fraction. In insects actively producing comb wax, a higher percentage of radioactivity was recovered in the monoester fraction. A dramatic effect of age on the distribution of radioactivity from acetate into the various wax fractions from honeybees studied in the summer months was observed. In insects from eleven to eighteen days following emergence to adults, the major wax component synthesized was monoester, whereas in younger and older insects, hydrocarbon was the major wax component formed. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments using insects actively producing comb wax showed that the abdomen produced significant amounts of monoester, hydrocarbon, and other esters, whereas the thorax synthesized mostly hydrocarbon. These data show that the epidermal cells and wax glands each produce a wax with a distinct composition, and that the age and seasonal differences observed in wax synthesis are due to the presence or absence of active wax glands. © 1980.","Apis mellifera; beeswax; honeybee; hydrocarbons; wax esters",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000959782

Similarly, like RPCH and Compound II, but unlike AKH, the Apis substance eluted at 1.2 Vt during Sephadex G-25 gel filtration. The data thus provide the initial demonstration that the endocrine system of at least one hymenopteran contains a peptide that is chemically and biologically comparable to the RPCH/AKH/Compound II group of hormonally active peptides.

Single bolus injections of whole venom (5-20 μg) irreversibly paralysed the isolated heart in 30-60 sec; perfusion of lower concentrations (1-8 μg/g tissue/min) caused paralysis over longer periods. In the whole animal, bee venom produced two differing responses on blood pressure depending on resting levels. In animals with a mean blood pressure of 95/67 mmHg, venom (0·5 mg/kg body weight) caused an increase of about 20 mmHg in 30 sec; in animals with a mean blood pressure of 138/112 mmHg, venom (0·7 mg/kg body weight) caused a marked fall. In both cases blood pressure returned to pre-venom levels after 5 min. Electrocardiographic changes were noted 15-20 min after envenomation, principally T wave elevation followed by ST-segment depression.

Fixed honey‐bees were conditioned to a scent in a one‐trial learning paradigm. In contrast to free‐flying colour‐conditioned bees, fixed scent‐conditioned bees do not show a biphasic time dependence of the conditioned response. Small metal probes were used to cool localized areas of the antennal lobes, alpha‐lobes, and calyces of the mushroom bodies of the brain at various times after conditioning. Localized cooling impaired the formation of memory in all three structures. The susceptibility to impairment after conditioning lasted approximately 3 min in the antennal lobes, 7 min in the alpha‐lobes, and 10 min in the calyx area. It was possible to determine the influence of the contralateral hemisphere (relative to the learning antenna) by conditioning bees with only one antenna. No contralateral impairment was found in the antennal lobes; there were minor effects in the alphalobes; contralateral cooling led to reductions of the conditioned response only in the calyx area. The temperature dependence of memory impairment was different for the antennal lobes and the mushroom bodies (alpha‐lobes and calyces). The latter were most sensitive to cooling at 5°C. No correlation between cooling duration and impairment of memory was found in the antennal lobes, but there was a linear relation between impairment and cooling duration in the alpha‐lobes. Brief cooling (5 or 10 s) resulted in significant impairment of memory formation only in the calyx area. A series of control experiments proved that the impairment of memory is due to a reversible block of neural activity. It was possible to show that the impairment is specific for the three neural structures analysed, by cooling the lobula of the optic system at various times after conditioning. Lesions of the brain or application of KCl also resulted in time‐dependent reductions of the conditioned response. Cooling the entire animal at various times after conditioning led to similar memory impairment to that resulting from localized cooling of the alphalobes. Copyright © 1980, Wiley Blackwell.

The major sterol present in each prepupal sample was 24-methylenecholesterol, but significant levels of sitosterol and isofucosterol were also present in every case, as was a very small percentage of desmosterol (usually < 1%). This is the first report of isofucosterol being identified in the sterols of the honey bee. A considerably larger percentage of each dietary sterol was found in prepupae reared by workers fed that particular sterol in the diet. This was most dramatic in the case of the cholesterol diet in which case cholesterol content increased to as much as 17.2% of the prepupal sterols, whereas cholesterol had not exceeded 2.2% in samples from other diet regimens. However, stigmasterol comprised no more than 6.3% of the total sterols in any sample from prepupae fed the stigmasterol diet. The preponderance of 24-methylenecholesterol in all prepupae, regardless of the dietary sterol provided to the workers, as well as the lesser quantities of sitosterol and isofucosterol present in all samples, suggest a unique system of utilization and metabolism of these dietary sterols by the worker bees.

The queens produced diploid drone larvae in about 25% of worker cells. Altogether, 9734 eggs were individually recorded, and the survival rate of brood was monitored on successive days. All the results showed that diploid drone larvae of Apis cerana are not eaten by nurse bees during the first day of larval life as in Apis mellifera. In unfavourable environmental conditions some were eaten in place of worker larvae. Many diploid drone larvae were eaten in their second day of life, but some were reared even until the fourth day, and in favourable conditions some probably reach the adult stage. This suggests that A. cerana diploid drone larvae secrete much less cannibalism substance at the beginning of larval life, but later produce it for a much longer period of life, than do A. mellifera diploid drones. This is another specific difference between the two species of Apis, indicating an earlier evolutionary stage in A. cerana. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042195497

In view of the uniqueness of the spermatogenic process in the honeybee haploid drone this study was made in order to compare the events characteristic of spermatogenesis in other bees. Based on the results obtained we conclude that usually the primary spermatocytes undergo an abortive first meiotic division and further an unequal division of the secondary -spermatocyte. This mechanism in associated to the formation of centriolar blebs. The main difference observed is concerned with the premeiotic cell division (4 in Apis and 5 ones in other bees).

The change in direction on successive flights between flowers were independent of the number of immediately preceding consecutive rewarding visits but decreased as the number of non-rewarding visits increased. Flight distances were short after visits to rewarding flowers but increased as the number of immediately preceding non-rewarding visits increased. The bees' rate of caloric intake (calories/time) was highest at the floral arrays having the highest density, and it was greater at arrays with clumped nectar-distributions than at those with randomly distributed nectar.

Effects were tested with ventral nerve cord ganglia of the cockroach Periplaneta americana, locust Schistocerca gregaria, and honey bee Apis mellifera. Formation of reaction products, chiefly ethyl acetate and diethoxymethane, seemed to play only a subsidiary role: neither individually appeared essential as long as a sufficient quantity of one or the other was present. In place of diethoxymethane, ethyl acetate concentration could be increased to 25% with little effect on results. Reduction in concentration of two of the original constituents, formaldehyde and ethanol, appeared to be the principal factor in improving fixation. Varying the concentration of each original constituent individually revealed that formaldehyde mainly increased glial staining, ethanol increased tissue shrinkage and reduced overall staining intensity, acetic acid improved preservation, and picric acid decreased glial staining but produced few other effects within a wide range of concentrations, though its omission seriously impaired overall preservation and staining. Varying the ethanol and acetic acid concentrations simultaneously confirmed that they acted in opposite ways. A decrease in ethanol and an increase in acetic acid both improved results. The optimum mixture, 'improved synthetic alcoholic Bouin' (40% formaldehyde 0-15: ethanol 25: acetic acid 5: ethyl acetate 5: diethoxymethane 15: picric acid 0.5: water to 100), gives better preservation and more intense staining, and formaldehyde content can be varied to give the degree of glial staining required. Without formaldehyde glial staining is virtually eliminated, while preservation and staining of the neurons appears unaffected.

Forty-five species of nectarivorous animals were recorded. Diurnal visitors included seven bird, nine butterfly. four moth (including two hawkmoth), two bee, two ant, one wasp, three blowfly, one fruit fly, two beetle and one weevil species. while nocturnal visitors included one bat and 12 moth (including three hawkmoth) species. Floral dimensions were such that only the vertebrate and larger insect species regularly contacted anthers and stigmas while foraging. Of these groups the feral honey bee (Apis mellifera) was the most common flowet visitor. Honeyeaters and hawkmoths appeared to be the most important native pollinators; they were abundant in the study area and visited numerous flowers (50-250) in quick succession (1-3 s per flower) on each foraging bout. The only major differences in foraging times observed in the pollinator array were between diurnal, diurnal and crepuscular, and nocturnal floral visitors. Spatial partitioning of the nectar resource was limited to one instance of territoriality involving a Macleay’s honeyeater (Meliphaga rnacleayana) on a densely flowering branch prior to peak blooming time, occasional aggressive chases by honeyeaters, and a division of foraging modes into rapid, erratic flights of 0.5-4 m between flowers (hawkmoths) as against nearest-flower movements (all other groups). This lack of major spatial partitioning may have been due to the mass flowering of S. tierneyanum and the resultant superabundance of nectar. The vast majority (c. 99.95%) of interflower movements observed in foraging bouts of birds (and of hawkmoths) were within the same plant. This suggests that most seeds of S. tierneyanum may be derived from self-pollination. © 1980 CSIRO. All rights resereved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84971024017

Data on nectar production, nectar availability, ambient air temperature and the numbers of visiting honeyeaters and honeybees were collected. Most of the daily nectar production in E. incrassata occurs early in the morning when temperatures are too low for insects to forage. In addition, insects, particularly honeybees, are unable to exploit nectar in the youngest flowers because the stamens are clustered tightly around the style. As a result of these temporal and structural characteristics of the flowers, honeyeaters are able to harvest most of the nectar. Honeybees potentially have access to 35-47% of the average daily production of floral nectar in E. incrassata and actually harvest considerably less. These data show that E. incrassata flowers are adapted to restrict insect foragers despite their superficially unspecialized appearance. Eight forest and woodland eucalypts do not have a flower stage which excludes insects and the significance of this difference is discussed. © 1979 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001042683

Receptor potentials in honeybee drone retinula cells were recorded with intracellular micro‐electrodes in the dorsal part of the superfused retina. The light stimuli were sufficiently weak that the response amplitude was proportional to the intensity. 2. Responses to stimuli of different wave‐lengths, although of different amplitude, all had the same time course. 3. The maximal sensitivity in all the cells recorded from was to a wave‐length between 450 and 460 nm. 4. Microspectrophotometry showed the presence of a pigment with two stable states, interconvertible by light, absorbing maximally at 445 nm (rhodopsin) and 505 nm (metarhodopsin). 5. There was a good match between the absorption spectrum of rhodopsin and the spectral sensitivity of retinula cells. 6. Transformation of a large fraction of rhodopsin to metarhodopsin by light reduced the sensitivity of the retinula cell but did not alter the shape of the relative spectral sensitivity curve or the time course of the responses. 7. It is concluded that for weak lights the receptor potential is determined only by the number of rhodopsin molecules that absorb photons: neither the presence of metarhodopsin nor its phototransformation to rhodopsin produces a detectable effect. © 1979 The Physiological Society",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0018536115

It was shown that thermoregulation significantly stimulated the brood in the nest. Among the species investigated, the highest thermoregulatory capacities are exhibited by honey bees, this fact being associated with the large number of individuals in their colonies. During cooling, bees group around the brood and their bodies make a cover of thermal insulation. Sheltering of the nests plays the main role in heat preservation of wasps and bumblebees. The latter, using contact method of heating of cells with the brood, provide rather constant temperature for its development. Honey bees, wasps and bumblebees react to overheating in the nests essentially in a similar way, i. e. by active aeration of their nests by vigorous wing beatings.

Intracellular recordings have been made from identified ocellar L neurons within the brain of the bee Apis mellifera. The main features of these cells are an input arborization in the ocellar cup, an axonal segment, and an output arborization in the posterior slope neuropile. Light stimulation of the ocelli results in a transient graded hyperpolarisation of the L neuron, which spreads over a major part of the total cell length. The shaping of the L neuron response is examined with respect to the synaptic organisation of the ocellar retinal plexus. Combined light, E.M. and electrophysiological studies show that the axonal segment must be regarded as an integrative area as well as a transmission pathway. The axonal synaptic region may form a site for efferent modulation of L neuron activity. Anatomical and electrophysiological evidence indicates that the output synapses can be ""driven"" directly by the graded potential without the intervention of spiking activity. 2. Anatomical studies show that some descending neurons in the posterior slope neuropile have input from both ipsilateral compound eye and ocellar L neurons. One consequence of the direct projection of the L neurons from ocellar retina to posterior slope is that visual signals in this pathway can reach descending neurons more rapidly than those in the compound eye pathway. It is suggested that dynamic interaction of these two visual inputs occurs at the level of the descending neuron, each pathway coding specific aspects of the visual surround. 3. Spiking activity in the ocellar tract is attributed to activity in the smaller diameter neurons. Most of these cells showed a light inhibitory response to ocellar illumination. A small number of light excitatory neurons were encountered. © 1979 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0039446754

The incorporation of [1 -14C]-palmitate into monoester was stimulated by ATP, CoA, and MgCl2, and the addition of palmitoyl-CoA caused a five fold increase in monoester synthesis using [R-3H]-tetracosanol as the labelled substrate. This indicated that the mechanism of monoester synthesis involved the transfer of an acyl group from acyl-CoA to a primary alcohol.

Two hundred and eleven persons attended at the first survey in September, 1976 (off the season of strawberry culture) and the 58 attended at the second survey in March, 1977 (within the season). The participants of the first survey consisted of three groups, i.e. farmers with and without strawberry culture and people without farming. The participants of the second survey consisted only of farmers with strawberry culture. Results are summarized as follows. 1) There were no difference of incidence of various clinical findings detected by an ophthalmologist and otolaryngologists among the three groups. 2) There were also no difference of incidence of abnormal findings in urine tests, liver functions, respiratory test, blood examinations and blood pressure test among the three groups. However, the comparison of persons in charge of strawberry culture and attended at both of the first and, the second surveys, such changes were detected as increases in the value of GOT (within normal limits), of stab neutrophiles, lymphocytes and of monocytes within the season of strawberry culture. 3) Increases of positive rates in skintest by extracts of house dust and Candida sp. were observed in the farmers with and without strawberry culture. Positive rates of skintest by strawberry pollen and honey bee extracts among the farmers with strawberry culture were markedly higher than the allergic patients in Dokkyo Hospital having no relation to this culture. This positive rate was markedly elevated among the persons who complained the symptom of rhinorrea within the season. 4) In conclusion, there was no serious health effect by strawberry culture upon the farmers as far as routine clinical examinations show, except overwork, symptoms from unusual stance during the work in the house. However, it is clear that persons with allergic constitution shall be sensitized by strawberry pollen and honey bee extracts which develop nasal symptoms due to antigen-antibody reaction. © 1979, Japan Society for Occupational Health.

The youngest larvae were collected from worker cells for microscopical investigation. Examinations of slides prepared from 572 larvae (originating from all the sibling-mated queens) showed that 27–4% were drones, most of which must have developed from fertilized eggs. This percentage is close to the expected 25%, and it is concluded that the sex determination mechanism in A. cerana is similar to that in A. mellifera, where there is one sex locus X with several alleles.

The data also suggest preferences exist for previously inhabited nest cavities and for nest sites beyond 300 m from the parent colony. 3. Nest sites with high exposure and visibility were occupied more rapidly than sites with low exposure and visibility. However, this difference probably reflects differential ease of nest site discovery rather than a preference for exposed nest sites. 4. No preferences were found in the following variables: entrance shape (slit vs. circle), nest cavity shape (cube vs. tall parallelepiped), cavity draftiness (sound vs. drafty), and cavity dryness (wet vs. dry). Cavity draftiness and dryness are probably important to bees, but because bees can seal and waterproof their nests, they may be less demanding about these two nest site variables than about those they cannot modify. 5.

Uptake of the insecticides from the lumen of the foregut into foregut tissue was directly proportional to insecticide lipophilicity, but penetration through the foregut was not. Of the three insecticides studied, parathion appeared to possess the optimal physicochemical characteristics required for penetration. The uptake of carbaryl and release of dieldrin by the foregut tissues may limit their respective penetration rates. Insecticide penetration was found to be inversely proportional to the sucrose concentration in the lumen of the foregut in both in vitro and in vivo studies. The oral toxicity of carbaryl showed a similar dependence on the sucrose concentration of the solution in which the insecticide was fed. The data presented indicate that the honeybee foregut is permeable to lipophilic compounds and strongly suggest that this permeability may contribute substantially to the toxicity of orally ingested insecticides in this insect. © 1978.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0018179925

By this time the potassium concentration increased by about 20% in the glial cells. These results suggest that the glial cells may participate in the regulation of K+ activity in the extracellular space. The increase of potassium activity in the glial cells may be a stimulus for activation of cellular metabolism.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0017955795

The hymenopteran species reproduce by arrhenotokous parthenogenesis so that the males are haploid and the females are diploid. The present results, as also the earlier studies, show that the number of polymorphic loci and the amount of heterozygosity are smaller in haplodiploid than in diploid insect populations. This is in accordance with theoretical expectations, as both deterministic selection models and the neutral hypothesis predict that genic variability is reduced in haplodiploid populations. The average heterozygosity per locus is lower in eusocial than in solitary species.

The queens were not themselves vibrated until they had destroyed these cells, and they did not pipe. On average they matured in 7 days 2 h after their cells were sealed. In 3 other colonies the workers vibrated emergency queen cells, and this behaviour was associated with imprisonment of most of the queens, piping by one of the first queens to emerge, and swarming. Typically, the number of vibratory dances performed rose to a peak on all cells at about the time the first queens matured. The number then dropped sharply when a free queen began to pipe, but rose to a new peak in the absence of piping when that queen left the hive with a swarm. Some of the workers vibrated individual cells at an increased rate while other workers were resealing cuts made in the cell caps by the queens in them. It was concluded that both vibratory dances and queen piping play a role in the imprisonment of queens through inhibition, although other mechanisms were also involved. Vibration of queen cells and of workers on them, as well as of free virgin queens, also appeared to protect the cells from attack. If virgin queens were vibrated in the presence of imprisoned queens, they piped and were sometimes chased by the workers. On the other hand virgin queens that were not vibrated did not pipe and remained quietly in the lower part of the hive. Piping may therefore be interpreted as a “displacement activity” caused by conflicting activating and inhibiting stimuli. The three colonies in which queen cells were vibrated produced 4 swarms, 2 of which were accompanied by more than one virgin queen. Some of the supernumerary queens emerged before swarming, and others emerged while the bees were leaving the hive. The data presented are all consistent with the “inhibition hypothesis” concerning the function of vibratory dances. © 1978 International Bee Research Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002623885

The outstanding morphological characteristics, biology and habits of 12 phytophagous arthropods associated with twigs, foliage, flowers and pods of the tamarugo are described and its natural enemies reported. Some of these species are endemic to the Tamarugal. Among the principal insect species are 3 Lepidoptera: Leptotes trigemmatus Butler, Cryptophlebia carpophagoides Clarke and Ithome sp. which are able to destroy 75% of the flowers, pods and seeds in certain years, and constitute the principal entomological problem. Solitary bees (Centris mixta Friese) and the introduced Apis mellifera are important factors in regard to the economical exploitation of the tamarugo as a “permanent tree crop” in one of the extreme desert areas of the world. Se describe la comunidad existente en la Pampa del Tamarugal en el desierto del norte de Chile, esquematizando el funcionamiento de la cadena trófica natural del tamarugo (Prosopis tamarugo Philippi) y los principales cambios realizados para canalizar la energía del ecosistema hacia el consumo humano. En la cadena trófica antropogénica el incremento de la productividad neta del ecosistema está basado en la (re)forestación de los salares con tamarugos y el aprovechamiento del recurso forrajero (frutos y hojarasca) con ovinos como consumidores primarios. Se describen los aspectos más relevantes sobre la distribución, morfología, biología y hábitos de 12 artrópodos fitófagos ‐ algunos endémicos de la zona ‐ asociados al follaje, ramillas, flores y frutos, señalando además los principales enemigos naturales encontrados. Entre las especies de mayor potencial reproductivo se destacan 3 lepidópteros: la mariposa violeta (Leptotes trigemmatus Butler), la polilla del fruto (Cryptophlebia carpophagoides Clarke) y la polillita de la flor (Ithome sp.) quienes son capaces de destruir, de acuerdo con los años, hasta un 75% de las inflorescencias y legumbres y constituyen el principal problema en el aprovechamiento económico del tamarugo como productor primario.

Honey bee swarms exercise considerable care when selecting a nest site. One nest site variable evaluated by bees is cavity volume. 2. The volume distribution of natural nests (Fig. 1) has a wide range (12 to 4431 observed), but most nest volumes are clustered in the 20- to 100-1 subrange. The modal volume is approximately 351. This distribution reflects a process of volume selection among potential nest cavities when a swarm chooses its nest site. For example, swarms prefer 40-1 to 10 and 100-1 nest cavities. In nature, the volume-selection process operates primarily by rejecting undersized cavities, but also by rejecting oversized cavities. 3. The observed limit in resolution power of volume perception was discrimination between cubes differing by 151. 4. A swarm's preference in nest cavity volume is independent of swarm size. 5. A scout bee's inspection of a nest site spans approximately 40 min. During this time a scout spends, most of her time at the nest site, engaged in numerous brief inspections inside and outside the nest cavity. When inside a cavity, a scout's principal behavior is rapid walking about the cavity's inner surfaces. The pattern of walking movements over successive interior inspections shows (1) a general progression from walking mostly near the entrance to walking deeper inside the cavity, and (2) a tendency to traverse different regions of the cavity's interior surface on different inspections. 6. Honey bees can measure cavity volume if at least one of two conditions is fulfilled: (1) the cavity interior is well illuminated, or (2) the cavity's inner surfaces can be completely traversed by walking. The natural conditions for volume perception are probably low (<0.5 lux) cavity illumination, but traversable inner surfaces. The importance of walking to volume perception was demonstrated by manipulating scout bees' perceptions of a cavity's volume by varying the amount of walking required to move between points inside the cavity. The hypothesis is presented that scouts measure the volumes of dimly illuminated cavities by integration information on the distances and directions of walking movements made inside the cavity. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000196894

The frequency of the Adh-1 alleles is different in two analyzed subspecies, Apis mellifera adansonii (African bees) and Apis mellifera ligustica (Italian bees). In the African bees, the frequencies are 0.256 and 0.697 for Adh-11 and Adh-12, respectively. In the Italian bees, these values are shown to be 0.902 and 0.098, respectively. The allele Adh-13 was not detected in the Italian bee population. The effect of NAD on the resolution of this system was investigated, and only one region of ADH activity was obtained in drone pupae analysis when NAD was used in the gels. However, two different regions of activity were observed in the same samples, in the absence of the coenzyme. ADH activity was not detected in young larvae, but it increased to a maximum in prepupal and white-eyed pupal phases.

In a single-comb observation hive young drones were near the centre and older drones on the outer parts, except that the lowest part of the comb was avoided (less so when the worker population was higher). Five hypotheses to explain the observations are discussed, and it is concluded that age-specific temperature preference is the factor most consistent with all the results obtained.

Chlorpyrifos-methyl was as effective and more consistent in activity than chlorpyrifos. Counter was more effective and consistent in soil than phorate other than under conditions of low soil moisture. No clear relationship between chemical structure and either direct contact or initial toxicity in soil was apparent. Tests on persistence of biological activity in mineral soil indicated that, as is generally the case with dimethyl and diethyl forms of organophosphorus insecticides, chlorpyrifos-methyl was even less persistent than chlorpyrifos.

As early as Vedic times, several sorts of bees were generally recognized. The “bhramara,” “bhowra” or carpenter bees (Xylocopa) were apparently used to carry messages, as homing pigeons are used today. These bees can return to their nests when released as far away as four kilometres, and they are large enough to carry small pieces of paper glued to the thorax. An ingenious technique was used by thieves, who kept some of these bees in a small box “bhramara-karandaka,” from which they were released at night, to fly into and extinguish lamps in the houses to be robbed (Monier-Williams, 1899). In ancient and modern poetry, these insects symbolize a libertine, lover or bearer of love messages; their beauty is also appreciated, for instance, “In Chet, agreeable is the Spring and beautiful the bhowra” (Sri Guru Granth Sahib). The territorial hovering, courtship, and fighting of male carpenter bees was called bee sport or “bhramara vilasita” in Sanskrit (Monier-Williams, 1899). © 1977 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345498556

Measurements are reported for the full range of angles between the gravity vector and the orienting light source, and for a wide range of foraging flight angles with respect to the sun. The 'compromise' dance angles observed when the orienting stimuli due to light and gravity conflict indicate that for intermediate intensity settings the bees favour light orientation for small light-gravity angles but favour gravity orientation when this angle is large. The re-orienting effect of light on the 'gravity dance modes', or of gravity on 'light dance modes', is not a simple trigonometric function of either angular variable, but is strongly skewed; it appears not to depend upon the foraging flight angle with respect to the sun.

To describe the nest site we made external observations on 39 nests in hollow trees. We collected and dissected 21 of these tree nests to describe the nest architecture. No one tree genus strongly predominates among bee trees. Nest cavities are vertically elongate and approximately cylindrical. Most are 30 to 60 liters in volume and at the base of trees. Nest entrances tend to be small, 10 to 40 cm2, and at the nest bottom. Rough bark outside the entrance is often smoothed by the bees. Inside the nest, a thin layer of hardened plant resins (propolis) coats the cavity walls. Combs are fastened to the walls along their tops and sides, but bees leave small passageways along the comb edges. The basic nest organization is honey storage above, brood nest below, and pollen storage in between. Associated with this arrangement are differences in comb structure. Compared to combs used for honey storage, combs of the brood nest are generally darker and more uniform in width and in cell form. Drone comb is located on the brood nest's periphery.

At the level of the monopolar cell body layer, the nine retinula cell fibres of each ommatidium, the six short visual fibres arranged in a circle surrounding the three long visual fibres, become cartridges as a consequence of the appearance of the second order neurons (L-fibres) which join the R-fibre bundles. Two of the four different L-fibre types, L-1 and L-2, remain together in the centre of the cartridge throughout the lamina. The axons of the L-3 and L-4 fibres, however, have their position integrated into the circle formed by the endings of the short visual fibres. On the basis of further examination of light and especially electron microscopical Golgi material, the different L-fibres can be classified into four types which appear in each cartridge. The clear stratification in the first synaptic region (A, B and C) seems to be the best criterion for a morphological classification since such a classification necessarily also includes a functional basis. According to a naming system based on the position of the lateral processes, L-fibres with side branches in strata A, B and C are called L-1 fibres. Fibres with lateral processes in strata A and B are L-2 fibres; monopolar cell fibres with branches only in the second stratum B are L-fibres of type 3; and all monopolar cells with branches only in stratum C are called L-4 fibres. In addition to the branching pattern covering only the parent cartridge, two of the four fibre types (L-2 and L-4) have long collaterals reaching neighbouring cartridges: L-2 in stratum A and L-4 in stratum C.

It is shown that both the decrease in sensitivity to light and the accompanying drop in potential from the transient to the plateau can be prevented by injecting EGTA intracellularly. A decrease in duration and amplitude of responses to short test flashes such as observed immediatly after illumination was found to occur too when Ca or Na, but not K, Li, or Mg, were injected into dark-adapted retinula cells. Injection of EGTA into a retinula cell maintained at a steady state of light adaptation, was found to cause an increase in amplitude and duration of the response to a short test flash, thus reproducing the effects of dark adaptation. It is suggested that, in the retina of the honey bee drone, an increase in intracellular calcium concentration plays a central role in light adaptation and that an increase in intracellular sodium concentration, resulting from the influx of sodium ions during the responses to light, could lead to this increase in intracellular free calcium. © 1976, Rockefeller University Press., All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0017226048

Analysis of the reassociation kinetics of honeybee DNA fragments 330 and 2,200 nucleotides long shows that approximately 90% of both size fragments is composed entirely of non-repeated sequences. Thus honeybee DNA contains few or no repeated sequences interspersed with nonrepeated sequences at a distance of less than a few thousand nucleotides. On the other hand, the reassociation kinetics of housefly DNA fragments 250 and 2,000 nucleotides long indicates that less than 15% of the longer fragments are composed entirely of single copy sequences. A large fraction of the housefly DNA therefore contains repeated sequences spaced less than a few thousand nucleotides apart. Reassociated repetitive DNA from the housefly was treated with S1 nuclease and sized on agarose A-50. The S1 resistant sequences have a bimodal distribution of lengths. Thirty-three percent is greater than 1,500 nucleotide pairs, and 67% has an average size about 300 nucleotide pairs. The genome of the housefly appears to have at least 70% of its DNA arranged as short repeats interspersed with single copy sequences in a pattern qualitatively similar to that of most eukaryotic genomes. © 1976 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0017177319

Hence mainly nectar gatherers pollinate onion seed crops. The speed of flower visits by honeybees is fairly constant in umbels. Accordingly, the number of florets visited depends completely on the time spent on the head. Air temperature and distance from the apiary within 800 metres failed to affect the time spent on umbels. In contrast, sky cover was inversely correlated to the time spent per inflorescences. Honeybees tended to visit middle section of heads most frequently. Much less bee touched the top and very few ones frequented the lower sections of umbels. It is suggested that at least 5 to 8 bee visits are needed for satisfactory pollination and/or seed setting of florets within umbels. Majority of honeybees visited inflorescences in a distance whilst they tended to fly along rows.

Da die Arbeitsgeschwindigkeit der Bienen innerhalb der Blütenstände die gleiche bleibt, hängt die Zahl der besuchten Blumen von der Zeitdauer des Aufenthaltes ab. Die Aufenthaltsdauer auf den Blüten wird von der Lufttemperatur und von der Flugweite innerhalb der Fläche nicht beeinflußt, dagegen ist die Bewölkung von signifikanter negativer Bedeutung. Die Honigbienen suchen meistens die mittlere Zone der Blütenstände auf, am wenigsten deren unteres Drittel.

Simultaneously, the density of nuclei in the corpora allata (CA) was measured. The secretion in the PI and CC is minimal at midday. With this the relatively small changes in the density of nuclei in the CA are negatively correlated. When normal animals are kept in a daylight cage, the content of secretion in the PI and CC does not decrease during the morning as it does in free flying foragers. It one places bees with black varnished ocelli in this cage, the amount of secretion increases very much, and some animals show an extremely high density of nuclei in the CA.

At 60°C the enzyme showed loss of activity in the presence of 0·7 M urea.

It was found that the epithelium maintains large concentration gradients of inorganic ions, generates an electrical potential difference of 21 mV, lumen positive, and produces a pH difference of up to 2.4 pH units between spermathecal fluid (SF) and haemolymph (H). The SF H concentration ratios for K+, Na+, Ca++, Cl-1, HPO4--, H2PO4- and amino acids were 7.7; 0.5; 0.8; 0.4; 1.03; 0.004; 0.3, respectively. While the pH value of haemolymph was constant at 6.17, the pH of SF increased with age from 7.3 to 8.6 over the first 3 days.

The effects of high doses of JH corresponds to the normal physiological changes in the ageing bee, especially at the time of the transformation into field bees. Hormone titre measurements show a drastic increase during adult life, which together with the injection experiments seems to indicate stimulating effects of low JH titre on protein synthesis and hypopharyngeal gland development during the first phase of adult life, and inhibiting and degeneration inducing effects of the high JH titre during the second phase of life.

Sources of these radionuclides in the laboratory environs include liquid and atmospheric effluents and buried solid waste. Honey bee colonies were placed in three canyon liquid waste disposal areas and were sampled frequently, along with honey, surface water, and surrounding vegetation, to qualitatively determine the availability of these radionuclides to bees (Apis mellifera) and to identify potential food chain sources of the elements. Tritium concentrations in bee and honey samples from the canyons increased rapidly from initial values of &lt;1 pCi/ml moisture to as much as 9.2 nCi/ml in 75 days after placement of the hives in the canyons. Seasonal patterns in foraging activities as influenced by weather and food availability were apparent in the data. It appears that several sources of tritium were utilized by the colonies, including surface water in the canyons and vegetation receiving tritium from atmospheric effluents and buried solid waste. Concentrations of cesium 137 and plutonium were generally low or undetectable in bees throughout the study. However, levels of both nuclides increased by factors of 10-20 in bees from two of the canyon study areas during a 3 month period in 1973. It was speculated that the liquid effluents in the two canyons were the source of the increased concentrations in bee samples, since this water was the only significant source of 137Cs in the environs. The existence of at least three radionuclide sources in the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL) environs complicates the interpretation of the data.

Colour coding in the retina of the honey bee, Apis mellifera, is examined by single unit recording and intracellular marking with the fluorescence dye Procion yellow. 2. The three receptor types (UV, blue, green receptors) are dominated by three rhodopsin - like pigments with absorbance maxima at 350 nm, 440 nm and 540 nm. This is in general agreement with the first discription of the bee's colour receptors by Autrum and v. Zwehl, 1964. 3. The UV-receptors were found to be those cells which form the long visual fibres. These penetrate the lamina with differing patterns of short arborisations and spines and project to the 1. or more often to the 2. medullary layer. 4. Most green receptors we have marked from the deep lamina axons which reach the internal (most proximal) lamina layer and end in several branches. The shallow lamina fibres come from blue or from green receptors. 5. The majority of cells have secondary sensitivities at wavelength regions where the other receptor types absorb maximally. We show with spectral adaptation experiments that this linkage is caused by a positive electrical coupling. We give arguments which exclude the artificial nature of the electrical coupling. 6. There is also evidence for negative electrical coupling between different colour receptors. We have recorded from several UV-receptors, which responded with a hyperpolarising potential to long wavelength stimulation. The narrower spectral sensitivity functions when compared with Dartnall resonance functions found in a smaller number of receptors are interpreted to reflect, too, negative electrical interactions between different colour receptors. 7. We propose a model of electrical interactions of densely packed colour receptors which postulates negative electrical coupling occurring within the retina and positive electrical coupling through the lamina cartridge. Further-more, we discuss our results on the basis of colour integration mechanisms within the lamina. © 1976 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001966961

Workers of Apis mellifera ligustica were tethered to an aerodynamic balance in front of a laminar wind tunnel. They had control over the tunnels wind velocity. Lift, wind speed, wingbeat frequency, thorax and air temperature, and the action potentials in the fibrillar dorsoventral (DV) and dorsolongitudinal (DL) flight muscles were continuously recorded. The air temperature in the tunnel could be controlled. Correlations between all mentioned parameters and the thorax temperature were analyzed. 2. Animals that assumed flight position and flew for more than thirty seconds disregarded optical inputs. They did not respond to changes in speed or direction of an optical pattern, and flew even in complete darkness. 3. In flights that started with thorax temperatures at environmental values, temperature differences between thorax and environment reached 5.2 °C after 4. 5 min of flight (Fig. 1). In animals with body temperatures above 36 °C, active temperature regulation could be observed: A large drop of fluid appeared between the ventral side of the head and the thorax, and the front legs frequently rubbed the fluid over the ventral part of the thorax. 4. The average wingbeat frequency showed a linear increase from 136 Hz at a thorax temperature of 24 °C, to 194 Hz at thorax temperature of 33.5 °C. A further increase of the thorax temperature from 33.5 °C to 38 °C was correlated to an increase of the wingbeat frequency to 202 Hz. This increase had a much smaller slope (Fig. 2). 5. The average lift increased from 28.5 dynes at 24 °C to 78.5 dynes at 33 °C (body angle 0°). The lift stayed practically constant from 33 °C to 38 °C (Fig. 2). The lift at thorax temperatures between 33 °C and 38 °C would keep the empty body weight aloft. The flight velocity increased from 0.8 m/sec, thorax temperature at 24 °C, to 3.3 m/sec, thorax temperature at 38 °C (Fig. 2). 6. The average action potential frequencies (APF) in the fibrillar flight muscles rose from between 8 and 9 Hz at thorax temperatures of 24 °C to between 12 and 13 Hz at thorax temperatures of 38 °C. In the range of biggest change in lift and thrust, at thorax temperatures between 26 °C and 31 °C, the APF in the dorsoventral muscles stayed constant, while it rose only one Hz in the dorsolongitudinal muscles (Fig. 2). 7. The increase in lift showed a linear relationship to the increase in wingbeat frequencies between 122 Hz and 158 Hz. Between 158 Hz and 208 Hz the gain in lift was bigger. From 208 Hz on the lift stayed constant. The flight velocity rose linearily with wingbeat frequencies from 122 Hz to 208 Hz (with some irregularities near 140 Hz) and with a steeper increase at wingbeat frequencies over 208 Hz (Fig. 3). 8. It was concluded that the large increase in the power output of the flight motor that occurred with rising thorax temperatures was mostly caused by an augmentation of the efficiency of the flight system and not by an increase in neural activation. © 1976 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746004025

In free running bees turns through an arbitrary angle were elicited by switching the light sources, which attracted the insects. 2. During the swift forward run the bees used the alternating tripod gait. During the slow walk the period of stepping cycle T could be longer than the time of run of the metachronal wave tm. tm and, more seldom, T could be different on the right and left side. 3. The methods a bee used for turning can be ranged according to increasing effectivity as follows: a) alterations of step amplitude and direction of drag, the gait remaining unchanged; b) duration of T and tm increased on the inner side of the animal and decreased on the outer side; c) the hind leg of the inner side halted; d) the same did the hind leg of the outer side; e) the legs of the inner side walked backwards. 4. As an estimate of turning efficiency we adopted the length of the path during turning, i.e. the trajectory of the centre of the thorax related to the turn for 1 radian. 5. With increasing the indicated angle of a turn from 0 to 180° the length of the path during the turn monotonously decreases, and in order to turn a bee applies more and more efficient modes. The conclusion is, that the turning command monotonously increases upon increasing of the error angle up to 180°. 6. This dependence of the turning command upon the error angle is compared to the well-known sinusoidal relationship, which was deduced from experiments in stationary (not transient) orientation. © 1975 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250405824

A technique allowing light- and electron microscopy to be performed on the same silver-impregnated sections has made it possible to follow all types of retinula axons of one ommatidium to their terminals in order to study the shape of the terminal branches with their position in the cartridge. 1. The axons of retinula cells 1-6 (numbered according to Menzel and Snyder, 1974) end as three different types of short visual fibres (svf) in the lamina; the axons of retinula cells 7-9 run through the lamina to terminate in the medulla and are known as long visual fibres (lvf). Retinula cells of each type are identified by the location of their cell bodies and by the direction of their microvilli. The retinula cells 1 and 4 (group I according to Gribakin, 1967) end as svf type 1 with three tassel-like branches in stratum B of the first synaptic region. The pair of cells 3, 6 and the pair 2, 5 (group II) end in the first synaptic region in stratum A. Cells 3 and 6 have forked endings, svf type 2, whereas cells 2 and 5 have tapered endings, svf type 3. The remaining retinula cells 7, 8 and 9 have long fibres.

A total of 249 queens were used, 27 being meliponids and 222 Apis mellifera. The populations of Apis have a B that does not differ significantly when they are compared to each other (1.29, 1.36, 1.32) and the balanced average equals 1.33. When the x-alleles are not considered, this balanced value is 0.262. The figures for B in the seven species of stingless bees ranged between 0.104 and 0.159 with balanced average of 0.132. The main reason for this smaller load in meliponids may rest in their effective population numbers, which are smaller than those of Apis. The average mortality for diploid females (0.141) and for haploid males (0.163) allows the estimation of the total elimination (sigma E = 0.073). Since for haplo-diploid systems the total mutation rate is sigma mu = 2 sigma E divided by 3 the figure 0.048 is obtained. Since about 15% of the genes in Apis mellifera are sex limited, this value of sigma mu should be added of 0.0072 (that is 0.15 X 0.048) and then, the total mutation rate becomes 0.055. Using a quite different method, the one by MORTON, CROW & MULLER, the figure 0.076 was obtained.

Likewise, reference to the most effective pollinator4 of a plant species is often based on estimates of the abundance of alternative pollinators. Demonstrations that various pollinators can cause seed set in caged plants5 and that pollinators transfer pollen in different amounts6,7 are difficult to relate to natural conditions.

This analysis of the retina-lamina projection was undertaken in the upper dorso-median eye region which is known to be involved in the perception of polarized light. For identification of individual visual cells and their fibres a numbering system was used which relates the number of each of the nine visual cells within one retinula to the transverse axis of the rhabdom (TRA) (Fig. 1). Because of the twist of the retinula along its course to the basement membrane (Fig. 6), individual visual cells change their position relative to any eye-constant co-ordinate system. Each axon bundle originating from one 9-celled retinula performs a 180°-rotation before entering the lamina (Fig. 2). The direction of rotation (clockwise or counter-clockwise), which may differ even between adjacent bundles, is related to the two mirror-image types of rhabdoms in the corresponding retinulae and is opposite to the direction of rhabdom twist. Thus, even in small groups of the in total 5500 ommatidia in the eye of the bee, two types of retinulae exist which can be characterized by the geometry of the rhabdoms as well as by the direction of rotation of the retinulae and the axon bundles (Fig. 1). Visual cell numbers 1, 2, and 9, the microvilli of which are oriented in the direction of TRA, form three long visual fibres terminating in the second synaptic layer (medulla). In cross sections of laminar pseudocartridges they appear as the smallest fibre profiles arranged in a symmetrical line of the pseudocartridge bundle (= the transverse axis of the pseudocartridge; TPA) (Fig. 4). The remaining six fibres (cell numbers 3-8) only project to the lamina (short visual fibres; svf's). Two of them (cell numbers 5 and 6), which are the largest cells in the proximal retinula and have their microvilli perpendicularly arranged to TRA (Fig. 1), give rise to the two thickest axons of the underlaying pseudocartridge. In cross sections, the connecting line of these two axons is orthogonally oriented to TPA (Fig. 5). A model was developed, in which all long visual fibres originate from ultraviolet receptors and in which the polarization sensitivity of the basal ninth cell is enhanced by the twist of the rhabdom. Finally, this model is discussed in light of behavioral experiments revealing the ultraviolet receptors as the only cells involved in the detection of polarized light. © 1975 Springer-Verlag.","Fused rhabdom; Second order neurons; Twisting of rhabdom; Ultraviolet receptors; Visual cells Apis mellifera",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0016620396

Landesinstitut für Bienenforschung, Celle, Germany","Quantitative studies on the tryptophan → ommochrome pathway are made in wildtype and mutant honey bees, Apis mellifera. The screening pigments xanthommatin and ommins are found in the bee eye at a quantitative proportion, depending on the particular developmental stage: the mature black wildtype-eye (drone, 12 days after emergence) contains xanthommatin far more than ommins, whereas the opposite relations are true for the violet coloured pupal eye. Characteristic pigment precursors (tryptophan and its derivatives) are accumulating temporarily in the haemolymph of all mutants except chartreuse. Herein the level of tryptophan proves to be very high (mutant snow); on the contrary, the amount of accumulated 3-hydroxykynurenine reaches rather low values only. The same compounds are accumulating in the clear rectal fluid at the reverse quantitative proportion. It can therefore be concluded that 3-hydroxykynurenine is removed from haemolymph faster than tryptophan. In consequence of an accumulation of kynurenine (ivory) or 3-hydroxykynurenine (cream, pearl, brick), the deaminated derivatives kynurenic acid resp. xanthurenic acid are found in pupae and young adults of the particular mutants. The new mutants 'bayer', 'spade', 'eyeless', are classified into the ommochrome pathway by their chemotype. Since the eyes of 'eyeless' ♂♂ are extremely reduced in size, the tryptophan catabolism leading to ommochrome is almost totally missing. Hereby the amount of tryptophan is considerably increased in the haemolymph of young 'eyeless' ♂♂. After having implanted tryptophan into the exstirpated eyes of ivory-mutants which had just emerged, kynurenine is being formed. This reaction was used, to estimate the activity of the enzyme tryptophan-oxygenase. Implanting of pigment precursor compounds in various mutants result in reactions, which demonstrate that the whole tryptophan → ommochrome pathway takes place in the eyes of bees. © 1975.","Honey bee; mutants; tryptophan → ommochrome pathway",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49549148084

During the swift forward run, the bees used the alternating tripod gait. During the slow walk, the period of stepping cycle T could be longer than the time to run of the metachronal wave t . t and, more seldom, T could be different on the right and left side. The methods a bee used for turning can be ranged according to increasing effectivity as follows: alterations of step amplitude and direction of drag, the gait remaining unchanged; duration of T and t increased on the inner side of the animal and decreased on the outer side; the hind leg of the inner side halted; the hind leg of the outer side did the same; the legs of the inner side walked backwards. As an estimate of turning efficiency, the length of the path during turning was adopted, i.e. the trajectory of the centre of the thorax related to the turn for 1 radian. With increasing the indicated angle of a turn from 0 to 180°, the length of the path during the turn monotonously decreases, and in order to turn, a bee applies more and more efficient modes. The conclusion is, that the turning command monotonously increases upon increasing of the error angle up to 180°. This dependence of the turning command upon the error angle is compared with the well known sinusoidal relationship, which was deduced from experiments in stationary (not transient) orientation.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0016755742

Three of the chemicals were too phytotoxic to seed alfalfa and cotton foliage for further consideration as repellents. One chemical crystallized when sprayed on foliage and needs to have the formulation modified. Eight chemicals provided slight to moderate repellence of bees for somewhat short periods of time. One of these, decylamine, when applied to alfalfa in bloom at the rate of 1 lb in 10 gal water/A (1.12 kg in 112 l water/ha) provided a 69.6% average level of repellence of bees for 5.5 hr. Another, Rutgers 6-12, when applied to broccoli in bloom at the rate of 1 lb in 10 gal water/A (1.12 kg in 112 l water/ha) provided an average level of repellence of 42% for 7.8 hr. These 2 merit further consideration as potential honey bee field crop repellents. Chemical structures reveal that the most promising repellents contain benzyl, phenyl, or tolyl derivatives variously substituted with short length carbon chains.

The larvipositional stimulant is soluble in water and in 0·1 N HCl and 0·1 N acetic acid and is insoluble in apolar solvents. Considerable activity is present in 0·1 N HCl extracts of acetone powders of whole H. virescens larvae. Larvipositional activity is destroyed by alkaline solutions. The activity of acidic extracts is greater than that of aqueous extracts when extracts are stored at 2°C for several days; however, extraction of the larvipositional stimulant is not necessarily more efficient with acidic extracts because there is no difference in the activity of the residues remaining after water and acid extraction. Thus, low pH appears to retard the decomposition of the larvipositional stimulant. Gel filtration, chromatography, and membrane filtration demonstrated that the compound has a molecular weight of 30,000 ± 5000. Rapid loss of activity during incubation with a proteinase (pepsin) indicates that the chemical is a protein. Larvipositional activity is present in larvae, pupae, pharate adults, and newly emerged adults of H. virescens. Most species of noctuids tested are highly active, and some activity is present in pyralid larvae. Very little or no activity is present in larvae of the beetle, Anthonomus grandis, or in Apis mellifera. © 1975.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001219979

The greatest amount of large pollen from the longest set of stamens is found on stigmas of long‐styled flowers. Because of the inability to discriminate between small pollen grains from mid‐level anthers and those from short‐level anthers it is not clear how stigma position may influence the distribution of these small pollen grains. In the Moroccan population studied, plants with long‐, mid‐, and short‐styled flowers are present in a 1:1:1 ratio. The chief pollinator during the period of study was the honey bee, Apis mellifera, which preferentially removes large pollen grains from flowers. Longs and Mids produce approximately equal numbers of pollen grains per flower, and Shorts produce c. 77% of the pollen of each of these two forms. Acetolysis of stigmas provides more accurate estimates of stigmatic pollen loads than does microscopic examination of intact stigmas, although the proportional representation of the two size classes of pollen is similar with either method. This study represents the first published analysis of pollen flow in a tristylous species within its native range and suggests that tristyly serves to promote compatible pollinations, thus supporting the classical interpretation of the biological significance of tristyly.

It was shown to have only one band of activity on disc gel at both pH's 4.3 and 9.3 when stained by a new trehalase specific staining method and found to be quite different from the trehalases of the thorax. The intestinal trehalase was stable in the crude state but became very unstable after partial purification whereas the thoracic honey bee trehalases are quite stable even when purified. Of a series of compounds tried only Mn2+ and Mg2+ were able to slow down the rate of inactivation of the intestinal enzyme. Stability studies of the enzymes at temperature and pH extremes showed no significant differences between this enzyme and bee thorax trehalases but urea, even at low concentrations, caused rapid activity loss relative to the thorax trehalases. The Km of the intestinal trehalase was 1.11 mM and the activity was competitively inhibited by Tris and by p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucoside. These properties are similar to those of the thorax trehalases. A pH optimum of 6.0 was found for the intestinal enzyme and a study of the variation of kinetic constants with pH showed a complex ionization relationship with groups dissociating at pH's 4.5 and 6.2. The energy of activation for the trehalase reaction was found to be 7.8 Kcal/mole which is lower than the energy of activation for the thorax trehalases of honey bees. The molecular weight of the intestinal trehalase was estimated to be 135,000 by Sephadex G-200 gel chromatography. This molecular weight value is about twice as great as the molecular weight found for thorax trehalases. © 1975.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042107267
