The ninth cell is a short retinula cell which is found in the proximal third of the ommatidium. This conclusion is based on the following observations: (1) The most frequently found green sensitive cells have either no or very low sensitivity to polarised light. This is caused by electric coupling of cells with different microvilli orientations. The electric coupling was found to be independent of adaptation state. (2) There are two different types of UV receptors: the more frequently found UV cells also have a distinct spectral sensitivity at longer wavelengths (>450 nm) and a small polarisation sensitivity. A very rarely recorded UV receptor type with no sensitivity to longer wavelengths (>450 nm) has a high polarisation sensitivity (average PS = 5, maximal PS = 9). All recordings of these UV cells were made close to the basement membrane in the region of the 9th cell. (3) The short length of the 9th cell, its position in the proximal third of the ommatidium, and the orientation of the microvilli is theoretically consistent with it having a high polarisation sensitivity. To find evidence for the mechanisms underlying the integration of polarisation information coming from the 9th cells, we examined the microvilli orientation of these cells in neighbouring ommatidia in different eye regions. While the medio-ventral eye region contains only one population, with microvilli oriented at 45 ° to the vertical, the dorsal and medio-dorsal eye regions contain two populations lying at 120 ° or 60 ° to each other. The pattern of microvilli orientation is a mirror image in both eyes. This pattern enables an unambiguous determination of the polarisation plane in the dorsal and medio-dorsal eye part if there is a comparison of excitation in the 9th cells of neighbouring ommatidia and/or ommatidia in the two eyes sharing the same field of view. Our conclusions are consistent with v. Frisch's findings on the orientation to polarised light by the worker bee. © 1974 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0016204968

The spontaneous choice behavior of bees between two lights-a reference light of constant intensity (Ic) and a test light of variable intensity (Iv)-was tested by means of a binary choice apparatus. 2. The intensity discrimination threshold for white light was determined in an intensity range of five powers of ten. Defining 65% choice frequency as reaction threshold, an intensity difference of 14.5% is perceived at the highest intensity tested (Ic=3.6 W/m2=relative intensity 1). This difference increases only slightly, to 18.7%, with a decrease in relative intensity to 10-3, but at a relative intensity of 10-4 it increases to 57.2% (Fig. 3). 3. According to these findings the least potential difference noted at receptor niveau is about 1 mV as can be determined by means of the intensity characteristic of the photoreceptors (Fig. 8). 4. The intensity discrimination sensitivity in ultraviolet, blue, and green monochromatic light was determined. No significant differences were found (Fig. 4). 5. An action spectrum, i.e., the spectral sensitivity function of the spontaneous phototactic choice behavior was determined by measuring the intensities of different monochromatic lights which are equally attractive as the constant reference light (Ic). It has maxima in the ultraviolet (350-360 nm) and in the green range (530-540 nm; Fig. 5). The relative amplitude of the maxima depends on the intensity of the reference light: The green sensitivity decreases when the intensity of the reference light is increased (Fig. 7, insert). © 1974 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250412421

Melittin is formed by proteolytic cleavage of a precursor, promelittin. Unfractionated RNA prepared from venom glands was injected into Xenopus oocytes and was shown to direct the synthesis of a promelittin-like substance. About half of the peptide chain made in oocytes has been sequenced; the 17 amino acid residues identified correspond exactly with sequences found in promelittin from venom gland cells. These results yield final proof that injected messenger RNAs can be read with great fidelity. The translation of a messenger from an insect gland shows that at least some of the translational systems within the oocyte are neither cell-type nor phylum specific. It seems likely that the oocyte can be used to assay any kind of eukaryotic mRNA. The conversion of promelittin to melittin could not be detected in oocytes. Moreover, the promelittin synthesized in oocytes differs at the carboxyl end from the product made in gland cells, for the latter terminates with glutamine amide while the oocyte material probably ends with an amino acid with a free α-carboxyl group. Some of the post-translational modifications characteristic of gland cells thus do not seem to take place in oocytes. © 1974.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0016291270

Six short and three long visual fibres leave each retinula in the bee's eye. Whereas two types of short visual cells can be distinguished by the arborization patterns of Golgi-stained preparations, as well as by their fibre diameters, three different types of long visual fibres can be found. In each cartridge (""neuroommatidium"") the six short visual cells closely appose three monopolar cells (L-fibres, second order neurons). Thus each axon bundle crossing the first (or intermediate) chiasma contains at least six large argyrophilic fibres (three long visual cells and three monopolar cells), and these can be seen in cross-sections of reduced silver preparations.

The anti‐inflammatory effect was assessed by measurement of the increased 125I‐albumin content of an injected site in comparison with an uninjected contralateral site. Peptide 401 also suppressed the increased vascular permeability due to intradermal injection of various smooth muscle spasmogens (histamine, bradykinin, 5‐hydroxytryptamine (5‐HT), and prostaglandins). Other comparable mast cell degranulating agents (48/80 and melittin) showed little evidence of anti‐inflammatory activity when tested at comparable dosage on turpentine arthritis and carrageenin oedema. The anti‐inflammatory effects were not abolished by pretreatment with mepyramine and methysergide, which abolished the increased vascular permeability produced by local injection of 401. The anti‐inflammatory action of 401 was not affected by regional denervation or pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine, and was reduced but not abolished by adrenalectomy. Measurement of skin temperature, fractional extraction of 86Rb and blood flow in perfused mesentery gave no evidence that the anti‐inflammatory action of 401 was due to reduced tissue perfusion.

Eighty per cent of the hormone-treated larvae were removed from their brood cell before pupation. Only 1 out of 42 adults showed characteristics of an intercaste. Fifty per cent of the control larvae (1 μl acetone) developed to adults, all of which were workers. After topical application of JH and feeding on royal jelly under in vitro conditions, the rate of survival is high (up to 85 per cent adults), but up to 67 per cent of queens and 44 per cent of workers exhibit eye malformations with characteristics of somatic mutation. Formation of a more solid web by the spinning larvae, shortening of the diapause by 1 to 2 days, and unusual shapes of mandibles, legs, and abdomen are a consequence of hormone treatment. The effects are less marked after application of 0·1 instead of 1 μg hormone or after its addition to the food (2 μg/g royal jelly). Treatment of the 2- to 3-day-old worker larvae and subsequent rearing on royal jelly is followed by a shift in caste differentiation from queens and workers to intercastes. In no case, are more queens developed after juvenile hormone treatment. Queen bee determinator, partially purified from royal jelly, induces a concentration-dependent shift from workers to queen differentiation. A threefold increase in the natural determinator concentration of royal jelly results in an almost exclusive (98 per cent) queen formation from 2- to 3-day-old worker larvae. In contrast to this direct effect, the influence of JH is explained as an indirect morphogenetic effect not directly coupled with honeybee caste differentiation. © 1974.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0016087561

Defining 65% choice frequency as reaction threshold, an intensity difference of 14.5% is perceived at the highest intensity tested (Ic= 3.6 W/m2= relative intensity). This difference increases only slightly, to 18.7%, with a decrease in relative intensity to 10-3, but at a relative intensity of 10-4 it increases to 57.2%. According to these findings the least potential difference noted at receptor niveau is about 1 mV as can be determined by means of the intensity characteristic of the photoreceptors. The intensity discrimination sensitivity in ultraviolet, blue, and green monochromatic light was determined. No significant differences were found. An action spectrum, i.e. the spectral sensitivity function of the spontaneous phototactic choice behavior was determined by measuring the intensities of different monochromatic lights which are equally attractive as the constant reference light (Ic).

The 100 Hz light-ripple is found to produce an intermittent light for the honeybee (Fig. 3). This intermittent light changes the behaviour of free flying bees towards obstacles (Fig. 4). This change is attributed to a decreased visual acuity under intermittent light conditions. The higher wing-stroke frequency found during free flight at 100 Hz is considered to be caused by a decreased loading of the vibrating thorax by the bees in order to fly more slowly. The decreased visual acuity is considered to induce a slower flight. These results justify our choice of a complicated lighting system for a honeybee flight and rearing room, producing a light-ripple above the critical fusion frequency of the honeybee’s visual system. © 1974, Brill.

Unlike published values for sugars in the hemolymph from healthy bees, trehalose was the predominant sugar in the thorax. Lesser amounts of glucose and only traces of fructose were found. Trisaccharides were found in the thorax after they were fed to bees. Progress was made toward determining which nonsustentative sugars are toxic and which are not accepted. Galactosides seem toxic per se and not to be progenitors of toxic galactose. Galactosides and mannose gave no buildup of a particular sugar to indicate metabolic blockage. Starved bees and moribund bees with empty crops contained glucose but no trehalose. Analysis of thoracic sugars has potential value in diagnosis of bee poisoning.

Results demonstrate that the enzyme's sulfhydryl groups are implicated in the process. Measured by 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) titration, native honeybee glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase has one less active sulfhydryl than the native rabbit muscle enzyme and displays changes in overall sulfhydryl reactivity after preincubation with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate plus NAD+. The total 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) reactive sulfhydryls of rabbit muscle glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase are not changed by preincubation with NAD+ or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; honeybee glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, under certain conditions of preincubation with these ligands, shows a decrease of two total 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) reactive sulfhydryl groups. This difference has been confirmed by an independent experiment in which the two enzymes were carboxymethylated with [14C]bromoacetic acid. The loss of sulfhydryl groups in honeybee glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase is not a result of its acylation by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. After generation of the stable form of the honeybee enzyme with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate plus NAD+ it is possible to regenerate the anomolous kinetic curve by treatment of the enzyme with dithiothreitol. It is proposed that in honeybee glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, an intrachain disulfide bond forms in conjunction with the conversion of the enzyme from the “metastable” to the stable state. © 1974, American Chemical Society.

The genic balance hypothesis was tested in relation to the different additive effects of various X-alleles. Different levels of heterozygosity of multiple loci were also considered. Apis mellifera adansonii and A.m. ligustica were crossed to determine the X-allele composition of the offspring; this resulted also in different degrees of heterozygosity in the progeny. About 300 queens were instrumentally inseminated, and haploid and diploid drones originating from 23 queens were investigated; 1460 testes were measured. The size of the testes of haploid drones of various groups differed very little. The average volume of the testes of various groups of haploid drones was 2.7–6.5 times as large as that of diploids of the same groups. Diploid drones of African bees had larger testes (mean volume 4.14 mm3) than those of Italian bees (mean 1.82 mm3), and backcrosses to Italian queens resulted in medium-sized testes (mean 2.76 mm3).Homozygosity of X-alleles reduced the size of the testes of diploid drones, but this size did not follow the X-allele compositions of the individuals. Thus the different additive ability of various X-alleles was not detected here. An increase of the heterozygosity of loci other than the X-locus did not decrease the size of diploid testes. The inheritance of this size was in accordance with additive action of special polygenes. Thus, breeding diploid drones with larger testes should be carried out on the basis of polygenes. © 1974 International Bee Research Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242307509

The signals were judged with reference to each other and to the preceding training situation. The easy signals to learn had a ""repellent"" effect, regardless of whether colour or scent was involved. 3. After being trained at a feeding place marked with both scent and colour, the bees had to choose between the two signals separately. If one of the signals had a higher value, the bees indenpedently favoured this signal. If both had a similar value as signals, the bees preferred the scent after 1-3 rewards, but the colour after 10-20. 4. The relative value judgement would appear to be independent of the concentration of the scent. 5. The biological significance of these results is discussed. © 1973 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002363176

Bumble bees visited purple flowers much more often than they did white flowers in a ratio of 3:1. Honey bees, on the other hand, visited white flowers more than they did purple flowers in a ratio of 2:1. Judged from the positioning of their heads in the flowers, bumble bees are generally nectar collectors while honey bees collect both pollen and nectar but more of the former. This strong preference has implications in experiments designed to estimate out-crossing where different flower colours are used in the detection of hybrid plants.

Altogether 54 queens were inseminated, and 2000 drones were used. Semen, which is difficult to separate from mucus, could be collected from only about one-third of the drones (average 0·16 mm3 semen per drone). This amount resulted only in traces of spermatozoa in the spermatheca of inseminated queens. Increasing the amount injected from 1 mm3 to 4mm3 significantly increased the number of spermatozoa in the spermatheca; increasing the temperature at which the queens were kept after insemination (from 28° to 34°) also significantly increased this number. In some queens inseminated with one large dose of semen, the oviducts were not emptied, in contrast to queens inseminated twice with a smaller amount. Queens inseminated with doses higher than 3 mm3 semen in June and July were still producing worker brood in worker cells at the end of the season. Insemination of A. cerana queens with 2 mm3 A. mellifera semen resulted in a considerably larger number of spermatozoa reaching the spermatheca than pure A. cerana insemination with the same amount of semen. The reciprocal cross (A. mellifera queen × A. cerana semen) did not give the same effect. It is deduced that these differing results were due to the greater concentration and activity of the spermatozoa in A. mellifera semen. It seems that semen from 40–60 drones is necessary for effective insemination of an A. cerana queen. © 1973 International Bee Research Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002728650

These reactions degradate the carbamic ester compound much more at the high temperature than at the low causing its negative temperature coefficient of activity whereas they activate the unpotent phosphorothionate compound and convert it to the phosphate analog which is stronger inhibitor.

Two types of cell were differentiated in the pars intercerebralis. A third type appeared to be identical with the second after ultra-structure examination, while using this technique yet another type of cell was differentiated (publication being prepared). In the axons-tractus starting from the pars intercerebralis special attention must be paid to the appearance of tracheoli, which due to their strong phloxinophile colour reaction could give the impression of a phloxinophile secretion. Using the same staining technique after Carnoy fixation one has no differentiation of the hematoxyline-positive secretion in an alcohol-soluble and non-soluble fraction. Staining with paraldehyde-fuchsine according to Ewen (1962) confirms the conclusion of the Gomori-staining. By staining with paraldehyde-fuchsine according to Halmi (1952) no secretory products could be shown in the cells of the corpora allata in the honey bee (worker bee). The glia-elements in the neuro-endocrine system of the honey bee can be clearly differentiated by the light green acid fuchsine staining according to Alzheimer. With dark-field illumination it has been established that the cells of the pars intercerebralis in the honey bee possess light-diffusing properties. Some other parts of the brain complex however exhibit the same phenomenon, so that this technique for differentiation of the neuro-secretory cells appears to be without practical use. © 1972 Masson & Cie.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250460543

The spectral range covered is 260-700 nm for Lycosa and Drosophila and 310-700 nm for the remainder of the arthropods. A complete description of the instrumentation is given. For the flies, Phormia and Musca, light absorption by the yellow and red pigments is high from 310 to about 610 nm. This implies that for these insects there should be no wavelength shift in electroretinogram (ERG) results due to light leakage among neighboring ommatidia for this wavelength range. The same comment applies to Calliphora erythrocephala, which is known to have similar screening pigments. For some of the insects studied a close correspondence is noted between screening pigment absorption spectra and spectral sensitivity curves for individual photoreceptors, available in the literature. In some cases the screening pigment absorption spectra can be related to chemical extraction results, with the general observation that some of the in vitro absorption peaks are shifted to the red. The Lycosa, Apis, and Libellula dark red pigments absorb strongly over a wide spectral range and therefore prevent chemical identification. © 1972, Rockefeller University Press., All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0015333491

N-Methyl carbamates were better inhibitors than larger N-alkyl carbamates. AChE from different species of animals showed remarkable species specificity toward these inhibitors. N-Ethyl carbamates were the least potent inhibitors toward bovine erythrocyte AChE, while N-w-butyl or N-n-hexyl carbamates were the least potent inhibitors toward AChE from housefly (Musca domestica L.), honeybee (Apis mellifera L.), and house cricket (Acheta domestica L.). Thus, short chain N-alkyl (TV-methyl to N-n-propyl) carbamates favored the inhibition of insect AChE, while longer N-alkyl (N-/z-butyl and up) carbamates favored the inhibition of bovine erythrocyte AChE. AChE inhibited by short-chain TV-alkyl carbamates recovered its activity faster than the long-chain A′-alkyl carbamates.

After postoperative survival times ranging from one to nine days the course and the spatial distribution of the degenerating sensory antennal fibres in the CNS were investigated; the amount of thick efferent antennal fibres was evaluated. 1) The major part of the glomeruli of the antennal lobe is organized into neuropile balls surrounded by fibre caps; sensory antennal fibres enter the caps primarily from outside to end there. 2) A worm like region consisting of fine nerve ramifications in the central neuropile of the antennal lobe next to the Tractus olfactorio-globularis medialis receives also sensory fibres from the antenna (possibly the pedicel). 3) Although the greater part of all sensory antennal nerve fibres terminates in the antennal lobe, a considerable part passes by to the dorsal lobe. 4) The dorsal lobe contains smaller glomeruli than the antennal lobe, where also sensory antennal fibres terminate; moreover sensory antennal fibres are found throughout the whole dorsal lobe. 5) A bundle of thicker sensory antennal fibres passes through the dorsal lobe to the protocerebrum to terminate next to giant fibres from the ocelli. 6) Another bundle of thicker sensory antennal fibres passes through the dorsal lobe to the subesophageal ganglion; together with thinner sensory antennal fibres it builds up a ""tube"" of afferent antennal fibres around the tegumentary nerve. 7) Sensory antennal fibres only in the subesophageal ganglion cross to the contralateral side; essentially their distribution is restricted to the ipsilateral side of the central nervous system. 8) There exist about 20 motor axons supplying the antennal muscles; they are the most laterally situated nerve fibres in the neuropile of the dorsal lobe; generally 6 efferent fibres together with the afferent antennal fibres constitute the mixed sensory-motor antennal nerve. 9) In the dorsal lobe sensory antennal nerve fibres end on antennal motor fibres; very probably in this region direct synaptic contacts between sensory and motor fibres without intermediate interneurons occur, thus permitting monosynaptic reflexes. 10) The nerve from Janet's antennal chordotonal organ goes directly to the dorsal lobe, where it bifurcates, one twig passing to the proto-cerebrum, the other to the subesophageal ganglion. © 1972 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Deuterocerebrum; Experimental degeneration; Light microscopy; Sensory antennal fibres",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0015274528

In two mutants a shift of 40 nm toward the longer wavelengths occurred as ommochrome synthesis proceeded during the first 10 to 12 days of adulthood.

From colonies with individually labelled bees (Apis mellifera carnica) single foragers were trained to an artificial food source. In the hive every dance follower (Nachtänzerin) was recorded. At the feeding station every newly arrived bee was registered and captured (4 experimental series, flight distance 100, 200, and 400 m). In one series the flight duration of every follower was registered. 2. 32 % of those bees, which had followed the trained bees dances, were successful in finding the goal (mean percentage from all series, Table 1). We call the percentage of successful recruits ""communication efficiency"". 3. According to the successless attendants, more than half of these bees did not leave the hive (100 m), i.e. they had not been recruited. However, 60% of those, which had left the hive, were successful and found the goal (Table 2). 4. The attendants followed 6.9-12.8 dances on the average. The successful attendants had followed more dances than those which did not find the goal: in the 100 and 200 m series they had followed 1.5-1.8 times more dances, in the 400 m series 4.3 times more dances than the successless attendants (Table 3). 5. The number of dances followed (Tanzverfolgungen) was correlated to 4-5 waggling cycles. One bee found the goal (400 m distance), after it had followed 5 waggling cycles only. 6.

After having been trained to single stripes or equidistant stripe patterns, which were orientated by α+ = 45° to the horizontal, the bees had to discriminate between the training direction α+ and the competition direction αc = 135° by means of special stripe configurations. These transfer patterns were obtained by varying different stimulus parameters of the original training stripes, for example by (1) reversing contrast between a stripe and the surrounding visual field, (2) changing the ratio of length/width and by this the dimensions of the stripe, and (3) inserting white intervals into the black stripes. In all three test series the bees succeeded in detecting the α+-direction along a broad range of stimulus variations. As the bees in the transfer tests positively responded to patterns, which on the other side were significantly discriminated from the training pattern (control tests), the information about the direction of the visual cue had been transferred to a new pattern configuration never seen by the bees during the training situation. This ability to generalize visual stimuli enables the bees to recognize distinct stimulus characteristics, even when other stimulus properties of a special pattern are changing during time. Secondly, small differences due to one stimulus parameter can be detected in transfer patterns, when the 'attention' of the central nervous system has been shifted towards that parameter by previous training. For example, better performances in visual goniometry by means of short stripes are obtained, when the bees had been trained to an especially inclined long stripe than to the short test stripe itself. The effect of 'training along a continuum' is thus demonstrated in arthropods for the first time. Although insects were thought only to possess rigidly fixed action patterns, the ability to generalize visual stimuli proved more complex recognition processes, which until now have been mostly found in higher vertebrates. © 1971.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001329462

Titration of the enzyme with either NAD+ or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G 3-P) yields kinetic curves which appear normal over a NAD+ concentration range of 0 to 16 × 10-5 m; however between 16 × 10-5 and 18 × 10-5 M NAD+ a kinetic transition is observed. This transition may be abolished by titrating the crystalline honeybee enzyme with NAD+ in the presence of 4 × 10-4 M G 3-P instead of 43 × 10-4 M G 3-P, by performing the experiment with enzyme that has been partially inhibited with N-ethylmaleimide, or by preincubation of the enzyme with 43 × 10-4 M G 3-P plus 1 × 10-3 M NAD+. Preincubation with either substrate alone does not abolish the transition. Equilibrium dialysis experiments have been performed with honeybee GPDH and the dissociation constants for the four NAD+ binding sites, in the absence of G 3-P, have been determined. On the basis of experimental results it is concluded that the sigmoid curee observed in the region of 16 × 10-5 to 18 × 10-5 M NAD+ in the saturation kinetics is not due to a cooperative interaction of the GPDH subunits. It is postulated that a kinetic activation of a metastable state of the enzyme may be responsible for the observed transition. © 1970, American Chemical Society.

La moyenne arithmétrique du nombre d'ovarioles, pour des ouvrières de 5 colonies, est comprise entre 3,8 et 5,1; le nombre le plus fréquent est 3 ou 4, et le nombre maximum varie de 8 à 15. – Le degré de développement de l'ovaire peut être estimé d'après l'état de différenciation et de croissance des ovocytes (ovogenèse) (fig. 2). – Les facteurs qui influencent le développement de l'ovaire sont étudiés, Parmi ceux‐ci il faut signaler l'influence saisonnière et l'effet d'un éclairement continu. – On a établi qu'il existe une corrélation cntre le nombre d'ovarioles et le degré de développement de l'ovaire. – Le problème de l'inhibition du développement de l'ovaire en présence d'ouvrières pondeuses est abordé. Les expériences réalisées mettent en évidence ce rôle inhibiteur. 1970 The Netherlands Entomological Society",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001012691

Single foragers from this hive were then conditioned to feed at a recording, automatic feeder with an adjustable food flow. This feeder was located so that the conditioned bee's behaviour could be continuously observed at both the feeder and the hive. The behaviour of several such conditioned bees was observed over extended periods of time and under a programmed regime of food flows. It is suggested that the duration and order in which foraging and recruiting behaviour occur depends on the relative rewarding of the food source, as measured by food flow. It is proposed as a hypothesis that the time spent by a bee at a food source or at the hive in each foraging cycle results from the balance between two tendencies: to stay and to go. © 1970.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49849117316

When the change caused much confusion, the bees soon reorientated in flight to the new entrance, but when there was only slight confusion many bees alighted at the old entrance site and ran to the new one. Such a trail of running bees was formed only when a hundred or more bees approached the hive together in the first instance. This stimulated a few bees to alight near the old entrance position and the sight of these alighted bees caused the others to alight. On alighting, the bees ran in all directions until one of them happened to find the new entrance and started to disperse Nassanoff gland scent, so attracting the other bees. Within a few minutes a trail of bees was formed, many of them dispersing scent, between the old and new positions of the entrance. Any visual landmark, between the entrances, such as a narrow, contrasting band of paint, greatly aided trail formation and alone enabled the bees to learn the way. Once the bees had learned the way, some continued to alight near the old entrance site and run from there to the new one, even when they approached the hive individually. However, many bees that ran between the entrances for some time eventually learned to fly round to the new entrance after visiting the old entrance, and most of these finally reorientated to the new entrance completely. © 1970.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1842294827

Data are given for the larval, pharate pupal, emerged pupal, and adult stages. The amount of glycogen, glucose, fructose, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, lactate, pyruvate, α-glycerophosphate, and of total lipid has been measured. These studies have been accomplished as a contribution to the understanding of the metabolic action of the determining substance contained in royal jelly, which is responsible for queen bee formation. In both castes aldolase activity is increased about twentyfold in the pharate pupa compared with the values of the larval stages. The activity then continuously drops to the newly emerged adult, which contains about 20 per cent of the maximum activity. A similar course is found in the case of phosphorylase. The activities of all the other enzymes follow a more or less U-shaped curve with high levels in the larvae and newly emerged adults. In the pupae the following minimum values of specific activity are reached (per cent of maximal activity): ALD 20, GAPDH 40, GDH 30, G-6-PDH 20, HK 30, LDH 30, PGK 30, PGluM 15, TIM 35. As a difference between both castes, an abrupt drop of several enzyme activities is seen in the worker bee between the larval and pharate pupal stage towards a level lower than that of the queen pupa (TIM, HK, GDH, LDH). The proportion of GDH LDH points to a more aerobic carbohydrate metabolism in the queen than in the worker. The accelerated development of the queen corresponds to a high activity of PGluM, HK, and TIM. The enzyme patterns in queens and workers follow the same endogenic rhythm dependent on the stage and not on the duration of adult development. The influence of the determining substance is more pronounced at the substrate level. After the sensible phase of determination glycogen concentration drops in the 4-day-old queen larva to a low level of about 5 mg/g fresh wt., which is rather constant in the further stages. The worker builds up a high amount of glycogen with a maximum of about 50 mg/g in the white-eyed pupa. This storage decreases continuously and attains the same low level in the newly emerged adult as the queen caste. Similar results are shown by the determination of total lipids, with values of about 10 mg/g in the queen pupa and about 40 mg/g in the worker. In both castes α-glycerophosphate, pyruvate, and lactate are enriched during larval development. In the following pupal stage all metabolite levels are lowered. The concentration of α-glycerophosphate during larval and pupal development is about 50 per cent higher in the queen than in the worker. During diapause lactate concentration is about twofold higher in the queen. © 1970.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0014820344

The pulsating sounds emitted by dancing bees are produced chiefly under the action of the same muscles.

It is hard to tell whether the chemosterilant acts directly or indirectly when the developing gamete is under the nutritional and regulatory control of the parent organism. But because adult male insects usually have a full complement of mature spermatozoa immediately after eclosion, only a directly acting chemosterilant should be effective for adult males. The male organism would then serve only as a receptacle for the interaction between the sperm and the chemical. When Herskowitz 2 used vaginal douches to insert a mutagen into inseminated female Drosophila, he obtained the first indication of mutagenic effects of a chemical on sperm outside the male organism. Because honey bees, Apis mellifera L., can be successfully fertilized by artificial insemination, we could test the direct action hypothesis by treating bee semen in vitro with the chemosterilant tris(l-aziridmyl)phosphine oxide (tepa) and determining the effect of the treated semen on the reproduction of the queen bees. © 1969 Nature Publishing Group.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0014685995

The ommatidia are composed of eight long receptor cells distributed in a circular pattern, each cell possessing an axon which extends to the optic lobe. Many microvilli form the individual rhabdomeres, which project toward the center of the ommatidium in two perpendicular directions to form the rhabdom. Rough endoplasmic reticulum and abundant mitochondria occur in the outer part of the receptors while in the inner part, near the rhabdomere, the cavities of a smooth form of the endoplasmic reticulum are enlarged to form wide cisternae. From distal to proximal ends, pigmented, nuclear, and fibrillar zones can be distinguished in the long axis of the retinula cells. In the fibrillar zone, microtubules appear. At the same level a particular receptor is detached from the ommatidium to form an independent axon. Overlying the receptors of a single ommatidium is a dioptric apparatus composed of a crystalline cone and a cuticular lens. The latter is a modified multilayered cuticule serving as a lens. The crystalline cone has a granular consistency and is enclosed by two modified pigment cells. Two other types of pigment cells are seen: (a) long pigment cells which run from the cuticule to the base of the retina; and (b) basal pigment cells, which are relatively short and located at the lower end of the rhabdom. The effect of dark adaptation and the functional significance of these findings is discussed. © 1969 Academic Press, Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0014604801

Congestion of adult bees in the hive, or simply large numbers of adult bees, encouraged colonies to confine young queens in their cells; congestion was at least the more important of these two factors. Depriving colonies of their flying bees increased their tendency to destroy queen cells. 2. 2. Cells from which colonies had allowed queens to emerge freely had most of the wax on their sides and tips, and the loose fibres on their tips, removed by the workers, whereas cells in which queens had been confined had little of their wax and fibres removed. Confined queens took as much as 30 hr to cut round their cappings and up to 4 days to emerge; they were fed while, as well as after, they cut their cappings. 3. 3. Colonies that confined queens in their cells all had one or more queens that piped, but many colonies with caged queens had no piping, particularly a group of colonies that had previously hatched uncaged queen cells. Caged queens that piped mostly began when 1 or 2 days old and continued for 2 to 7 days. 4. 4. Swarming when queenless colonies reared queens was always preceded by piping; colonies that did not pipe did not swarm. This was true even when young queens were caged in colonies instead of being confined in their cells by workers. A colony that had eliminated all but one of its young queens without swarming swarmed when subjected to recorded piping sound. © 1969.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0041889667

To test for inhibition of germination, spores were exposed to various concentrations of brood food from both genetic lines in culture medium, heat-shocked to kill vegetable cells, and then plated for germination of those spores which were inhibited from germinating. Results indicated that brood food, from an American-foulbrood-resistant line (Brown) of bees was more effective in inhibiting spore germination than brood food from a disease-susceptible line (Van Scoy). Tests for effects of brood food on vegetable cells involved their exposure for different periods of time to various concentrations of the food in an aqueous medium. It was found that brood food from the resistant line was more effective in reducing the number of viable vegetable cells than brood food from the susceptible line. © 1969.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002935140

A small amount of the dehydrogenase was also crystallized from bumblebee (Bombus nevadensis) thoraces. Rabbit antibodies directed against the pure honeybee enzyme were prepared, and the cross-reaction with extracts of other insects quantitatively measured with the micro-complement fixation technique. The order of decreasing cross-reaction is: honeybee, leafcutting bee, bumblebee (three species)-lobster-mining bee, flesh fly. The order: honeybee, leafcutting bee, bumblebee, was also observed in two-dimensional immunodiffusion and in a precipitin test. The relative cross-reaction of this enzyme, thus, varies considerably from the classical taxonomy of the species tested. The anomalous immunochemical properties of the glyceraldehyde-P dehydrogenases may be due to the relatively conservative changes in primary structure of this protein during evolution.

The primary spermatocytes in the haploid drone undergo an abortive first meiotic division and, further, an unequal division of the secondary spermatocyte occurs. The result is two spermatids rather than the typical four. Associated with the first meiotic division, a centriole replication process occurs resulting in supernumary centrioles; the latter are eliminated from the cells through cytoplasmic blebs prior to the second meiotic division. During the centriole replication process, several single annulate lamellae appear to be differentiated from pre-existing lamellae of endoplasmic reticulum. An amorphous granular material is observed to surround the replicating centrioles, and it is similar to material located in the pores of the annulate lamellae and nuclear envelope. Because of the specific orientation which the annulate lamellae illustrate relative to the replicating centrioles, it is postulated that they are somehow involved in the accumulation of material utilized in centriole replication. The secondary spermatocyte spindle has associated with it a nuclear ""wall"" composed of alternate vesicular and compact layers of endoplasmic reticulum. The innermost layer of this wall appears to give rise to the spermatid nuclear envelope. Spermatocytes are interconnected by intercellular bridges throughout the process of spermatogenesis and it is postulated that this syncytium synchronizes the division process. Spermiogenesis in the honey bee is similar to that observed in a number of other insects. © 1968 Academic Press Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0014313968

Heat decreased the number of spores germinating in agar and also the effect of crystals against wax moths at similar rates, crystals becoming almost ineffective after 30 min at 95°C. It is not practicable therefore, to add B. thuringiensis while the wax is molten during the manufacture of comb foundation. © 1968.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0014317779

A concentration of 1.25% protein from pollen of T. officinale in the diet stimulated as much gland growth as either a 7.5% concentration from pollen of Sorghum and B. viminea or a 5.0% concentration of pollen from Zea mays var. saccharata.

All degrees of variation from black to five-band yellow, or golden, occurs, and as these phenotypes grade from golden toward black, the yellow is replaced by black on a posterior to anterior gradient, with the last yellow to be replaced by black on the first two abdominal terga. In darker variants that are not quite black, the bands or spots on the first two abdominal terga are often brown rather than yellow. In golden workers, all but the posterior two abdominal sterna are yellow, but brown to black in three band yellow or darker.

Nine components were separated from the whole body and three from the venom sac preparations. By direct skin testing it was seen that fraction 1 of each type of extract contained the major portion of the allergenic activity. A fraction 6 of whole body extract also had allergenic activity, and in addition showed a specific antigen, among the group in this fraction, which seemed to be responsible for the cross-reaction with wasp preparations. This fraction 6 developed precipitation with antiwasp rabbit serum as well as with anti-bee rabbit serum. The antigenic heterogeneity of each of the fractionated products was examined by means of appropriate rabbit antisera to bee extracts. Six of the nine body fractions gave precipitation, as did one of the three venom sac fractions. Patterns ranged between one and four components in these various fractions. The one antigen detected in venom sac fraction 1 was proved to be identical with one of the four seen in whole body fraction 1.

Values of oxygen consumption and phosphate esterification by sarcosomes isolated in sucrose-EDTA media of differing tonicities were obtained. Sarcosomes prepared and assayed in the manner described required the inclusion of bovine serum albumin in the reaction mixture for efficient oxidation and phosphorylation. The addition of cytochrome c to the reaction mixture resulted in an approximate two to threefold enhancement of succinate and α-GP oxidations. On the other hand, pyruvate oxidation was not stimulated by added cytochrome c. Other factors that exerted a pronounced effect on the respiratory activity of the sarcosomes were the nature of the trapping system employed and the concentration of sarcosomal protein in the reaction mixture. Only under specialized conditions of incubation was it possible to demonstrate respiratory control by ADP concentration when succinate, α-GP or pyruvate served as substrate. Moreover, in all instances where ADP addition resulted in a stimulation of oxidation, the degree of stimulation was of low magnitude. Under some conditions of incubation sarcosomes exhibited a decrease in respiration after ADP addition to the reaction mixture. © 1965.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-23044485894

In feeding acetate with deuterium or 14C the isolated hydrocarbons and free wax acids were strongly labelled, but not the esters or their component acids and alcohols. Feeding uniformly labelled glucose or heavy water caused no extreme differences in the labelling of different lipid fractions.

The types of Hymenoptera studied were the bee (Apis mellifera), the wasp (Polistes exclamans), and the yellow jacket (Vespula pennsylvanicus), and extracts of each were prepared from the whole body, from the sacless body, and from the venom sac. In order to facilitate the routine determination of protein concentration, light absorption methods were developed and an extinction coefficient for each type of extract was determined for both ultraviolet absorption, at 280 mμ, and for the biuret reaction at 540 mμ. The allergenicity of these preparations was determined by direct skin tests. Positive intradermal skin tests were elicited in sensitive patients with as little as a 1:10,000 dilution of the preparation of insect antigen. Most of the patients reacted to more than one type of insect. Commercial preparations gave similar results. Zone electrophoresis, by filter paper strip and by starch block, revealed two or three separate components. It was noted that the best pH for optimal resolution, over the range of 8.6 to 4.5, was 6.5 for bee and wasp and 4.5 for yellow jacket. This method seemed to have limited value for the possibilities of fractionation of these extracts. The extensive heterogeneity of these extracts was better shown by analytical ultracentrifugation. All three types of whole body extracts had characteristic patterns of five homologous sedimenting boundaries, although the proportions varied for each insect. The venom sac extracts showed varying patterns of minor fast components and major slow ones. At least some of the venom constituents seemed to be absent from the whole body extracts. It will require further study to identify any of these components with the allergenic substance. © 1964.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49749201546

Ten different types of nectar are distinguished (with two or three very uncommon types in addition) and are broadly classified into: Nectars with dominant sucrose. Balanced nectars with about equal amounts of sucrose, fructose and glucose. Nectars with dominant fructose + glucose. Three oligosaccharides occurring in nectar are identified and a fourth is named tentatively. Eight hundred and twenty‐eight species appear to have nectar of constant composition: sixty‐one species have nectar which varies distinctly. The variation does not appear to be linked with locality or date of sampling. The distribution of nectar types is traced through the Herbaceae. Sucrose‐dominated nectars appear to be associated with long‐tubed flowers having protected nectar, and fructose +glucose‐dominated nectars with ‘open’flowers having unprotected nectars. Many humble‐ and honey‐bee, butterfly and moth flowers have nectars with sucrose more or less strongly predominating over fructose and glucose. The climax groups of the Cruciferae, Umbelliferae, a section of the Compositae, the Euphorbiales and the herbaceous Rosaceae have a completely broken‐down nectar of equal parts of fructose and glucose which is technically honey. The preference of Apis mellifera for certain sugar mixtures and the types of nectar in some honey‐bee flowers are explored. Copyright © 1961, Wiley Blackwell.

Histological, nutritional, and biochemical studies relating to female caste differentiation in Apis mellifera, L. are reviewed. Development of the worker larva evidently comprises two distinct phases, delimited by the addition of honey to the diet by nurse bees around the third or fourth day of the larval stadium. Comparisons between workers and queens may conveniently be related to these phases. 2. The dichotomy between castes appears to be initiated during the first phase and consummated in the second. There can be little doubt that nutrition is the major extrinsic factor in caste establishment. The identity of the dietary factor initiating the series of events culminating in female dimorphism has not been established. The results of many rearing experiments strongly suggest the involvement of a substance which is either volatile or unstable. 3. The mode of action of the dietary factor likewise is unknown. It is suggested that a difference in hormonal balance between castes is established in early larval life and is the intermediary factor linking nutrition to dimorphism. Caste differences in the endocrine system are known to exist by the fourth or fifth day of larval life; the earlier instars should now be examined for a relationship between nutritional and hormonal factors. © 1960 Masson & Cie.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0005261962

Actual swarming is more frequent early than late in the summer, but its distribution probably does not truly represent the seasonal fluctuation in the intensity of the factors which induce colonies to swarm. The incidence of swarm preparations in colonies which do not actually swarm, and of empty queen cell cups in colonies which do not prepare to swarm, shows a later maximum and one which, on the average, coincides well with the maximum availability of nectar and pollen in the field. 2. The final seasonal decline in brood rearing in colonies occurs at about the same time as the diminution in the tendency to swarm and in the availability of forage. In the colonies observed brood rearing did not decline permanently before this period except in some of those in which queen rearing occurred. Generally this decline occurred only after queen rearing had begun; thus it might have been a consequence of queen rearing but, in most cases, could not have been a cause of it. More colonies started to rear queens when their brood was increasing than did so when it was decreasing. The time of breeding does not seem to be controlled by changes in the length of day since the relationship of this factor to breeding in sub-tropical climates is the opposite of that which prevails in temperate climates. 3. A number of colonies began queen rearing before they reached their maximum size while others did not do so even after they had reached their maxima. There was no evidence that queen rearing began when the ratio of brood to bees fell below some critical level. 4. Although the time at which swarming occurs seems to be largely determined by the direct action of environmental factors the possibility cannot be excluded that it is influenced to some extent by a cycle of physiological changes within the colonies. © 1959 Masson & Cie.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0043153565

Karyo-typic analysis of haploid males shows eight homomorphic pairs indicating distinct somatic association (2 m.c.+2 s.m.c.+4 s.t.c.). Excepting the gonial and epithelial layers of blastoderm, other tissues show polysomatic increase in euploid or aneuploid numbers through repeated endomitosis. In view of occurrence of eight homomorphic pairs in the male showing somatic association, it is inferred that the male, thoughj numerically haploid is genetically diploid thus the famale being a tetraploid. This is supported by control of certain characters by multiple genes without linkage and diploid, constitution of A. florea having 16 chromosomes in female and 8 in male. It is suggested that A. indica originated from primitive diploid by (1) polyploidy combined with adaptive mutations for multiple enclosed comb habits or (2) hybridization at diploid level among closely related Apis and Trigona followed by polyploidy during pleistocene glaciation in the Indo-Malayan region. Primitive A. indica gradually evolved into A. mellifera which differentiated further into a number of African, Eurasian and Sino-Japanese races during the course of the passage through the three main northern migratory routes of the Himalayas.

The honeybee compound eye (f.f.f.=265/sec) has an e.r.g. quite similar in wave form to that of the cockroach compound eye (f.f.f.=60/sec).

Wave form of the e.r.g., photic sensitivity, and rate of dark adaptation are independent visual functions, not necessarily related to each other or to flicker fusion frequency.

When there were no colonies near to the old site 69-100 per cent. of the bees returned to their colony in its new position, although many of them visited the old site first. Some bees also visited the old site on subsequent occasions; the behaviour of individual bees varied greatly. The proportion of bees visiting the old site depended on the distance between old and new sites, and decreased with increase in the distance their colony had been moved. The greater the distance between old and new sites the longer bees spent at the old site before returning to the new one, and the less likely they were to return to the new one. A colony was moved to a second site out of foraging range of its old one and then, five days later, returned to a third site 15 yards from the first one; fewer bees visited the first site than if the colony had been moved directly from first to third site. © 1985.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343040607

This is followed by a period in which they are both fed by workers, although not to such an extent as previously, and feed themselves from honey cells. After they are about a week old they tend to feed themselves entirely and do not beg food from workers.4.Worker bees 2-26 days old were seen tofeed drones although those of 4-6 days old were most active in so doing. It is most probable that the workers feed drones with brood food.5.The behaviour of workers toward a drone appears to depend upon his age. At the same time as some of the older drones are being attacked by workers the younger drones present are still being fed.6.The workers who attack drones are probably unemployed foragers. © 1957.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0003062062
