The checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique is a semi-quantitative technique that has been previously employed in odontology to detect and quantify a variety of bacterial species in dental samples. Here we tested the applicability of the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique to detect the presence of Aedes aegypti-associated bacterial species in larvae, pupae and adults of A. aegypti. Findings. Using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique we could detect and estimate the number of four bacterial species in total DNA samples extracted from A. aegypti single whole individuals and midguts. A. aegypti associated bacterial species were also detected in the midgut of four other insect species, Lutzomyia longipalpis, Drosophila melanogaster, Bradysia hygida and Apis mellifera. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique can be employed to study the microbiota composition of mosquitoes. The method has the sensitivity to detect bacteria in single individuals, as well as in a single organ, and therefore can be employed to evaluate the differences in bacterial counts amongst individuals in a given mosquito population. We suggest that the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique is a straightforward technique that can be widely used for the characterization of the microbiota in mosquito populations. © 2011 Gaio et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Aedes aegypti; bacteria; Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83655181473

Recent honey bee losses causing decline of bee diversity is found alarming for the pollination of both wild plant biodiversity and crop production. Therefore, determination of genetic diversity of honey bee populations is essential and will provide a valuable resource for conservation purposes. Twenty Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers were used to assess the genetic diversity in 720 worker bees collected from 360 colonies of 25 provinces in Turkey. Ten out of twenty primers produced 105 reproducible, bright bands, all were polymorphic. Mean genetic diversity values ranged between 0.035 and 0.175, coefficient of gene differentiation (GST) values were estimated as 0.060 to 0.441, and the private band patterns reflected a high level of genetic variation. Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) partitioned the total genetic variation as 60% within, 40% among populations. The Mantel test did not reveal significant correlation between the genetic and geographic distances. First three Eigen values of principle coordinate analysis explained 63% of total variation, 27, 21, and 15% for the first, second and third respectively. The cluster analysis showed that the honey bees of Thrace region of Turkey and an island at a short distance were clustered together. The other two populations from southeastern Anatolia which belong to African lineage according to mitochondrial DNA analysis formed a separate cluster and rest of the populations which belong to north Mediterranean branch (C lineage) formed the third cluster. The results showed that genetic variability of honey bee populations from Turkey are determined using RAPD markers and provide information for future management and conservation plans. © 2011 Academic Journals.","Apis mellifera; Genetic diversity; Honeybee; RAPD markers; Turkey",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83455223471

Honey bee larvae are directly exposed to transgenic products by the consumption of GM pollen. But most ERA studies only consider responses of adult bees, although Bt-proteins primarily affect the larval phases of target organisms. We adopted an in vitro larvae rearing system, to assess lethal and sublethal effects of Bt-pollen consumption in a standardized eco-toxicological bioassay. The effects of pollen from two Bt-maize cultivars, one expressing a single and the other a total of three Bt-proteins, on the survival and prepupae weight of honey bee larvae were analyzed. The control treatments included pollen from three non-transgenic maize varieties and of Heliconia rostrata. Three days old larvae were fed the realistic exposure dose of 2 mg pollen within the semi-artificial diet. The larvae were monitored over 120 h, until the prepupal stage, where larvae terminate feeding and growing. Neither single nor stacked Bt-maize pollen showed an adverse effect on larval survival and the prepupal weight. In contrast, feeding of H. rostrata pollen caused significant toxic effects. The results of this study indicate that pollen of the tested Bt-varieties does not harm the development of in vitro reared A. mellifera larvae. To sustain the ecosystem service of pollination, Bt-impact on A. mellifera should always be a crucial part of regulatory biosafety assessments. We suggest that our approach of feeding GM pollen on in vitro reared honey bee larvae is well suited of becoming a standard bioassay in regulatory risk assessments schemes of GM crops. © 2011 Hendriksma et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-83455238797

Previous work in adult honeybees has shown that a single CaMKII gene is strongly expressed in the mushroom bodies (MBs), brain centers associated with sensory integration, and learning and memory formation. To study a potential role of CaMKII in synaptic plasticity, the cellular and subcellular distribution of activated (phosphorylated) pCaMKII protein was investigated at various life stages of the honeybee using immunocytochemistry, confocal microscopy, and western blot analyses. Whereas at pupal stages 3-4 most parts of the brain showed high levels of pCaMKII immunoreactivity, the protein was predominantly concentrated in the MBs in the adult brain. The results show that pCaMKII is present in a specific subpopulation of Kenyon cells, the noncompact cells. Within the olfactory (lip) and visual (collar) subregion of the MB calyx neuropil pCaMKII was colocalized with f-actin in postsynaptic compartments of microglomeruli, indicating that it is enriched in Kenyon cell dendritic spines. This suggests a potential role of CaMKII in Kenyon cell dendritic plasticity. Interestingly, pCaMKII protein was absent in two other types of Kenyon cells, the inner compact cells associated with the multimodal basal ring and the outer compact cells. During adult behavioral maturation from nurse bees to foragers, pCaMKII distribution remained essentially similar at the qualitative level, suggesting a potential role in dendritic plasticity of Kenyon cells throughout the entire life span of a worker bee. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Apis mellifera; Calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II; Learning and memory; Microglomeruli; Olfactory; Synaptic plasticity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054700131

However, convincing evidence supporting the significant contribution of the transferred genes to the evolution of metazoan recipients is rare. Results: In this study, based on sequence data accumulated to date, we used a unified method consisting of similarity search and phylogenetic analysis to detect horizontally transferred genes (HTGs) between prokaryotes and five insect species including Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Bombyx mori, Tribolium castaneum and Apis mellifera. Unexpectedly, the candidate HTGs were not detected in D. melanogaster, An. gambiae and T. castaneum, and 79 genes in Ap. mellifera sieved by the same method were considered as contamination based on other information. Consequently, 14 types of 22 HTGs were detected only in the silkworm. Additionally, 13 types of the detected silkworm HTGs share homologous sequences in species of other Lepidopteran superfamilies, suggesting that the majority of these HTGs were derived from ancient transfer events before the radiation of Ditrysia clade. On the basis of phylogenetic topologies and BLAST search results, donor bacteria of these genes were inferred, respectively. At least half of the predicted donor organisms may be entomopathogenic bacteria. The predicted biochemical functions of these genes include four categories: glycosyl hydrolase family, oxidoreductase family, amino acid metabolism, and others. Conclusions: The products of HTGs detected in this study may take part in comprehensive physiological metabolism. These genes potentially contributed to functional innovation and adaptability of Lepidopteran hosts in their ancient lineages associated with the diversification of angiosperms. Importantly, our results imply that pathogens may be advantageous to the subsistence and prosperity of hosts through effective HGT events at a large evolutionary scale. © 2011 Li et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Functional innovation; Horizontal gene transfer; Insect evolution; Lepidoptera evolution; Pathogenic bacteria",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83155163802

Research on olfaction in honeybees has greatly benefited from the advent of a range of behavioral and neurophysiological paradigms in the Lab. Here I review major findings about how the honeybee brain detects, processes, and learns odors, based on behavioral, neuroanatomical, and neurophysiological approaches. I first address the behavioral study of olfactory learning, from experiments on free-flying workers visiting artificial flowers to laboratory-based conditioning protocols on restrained individuals. I explain how the study of olfactory learning has allowed understanding the discrimination and generalization ability of the honeybee olfactory system, its capacity to grant special properties to olfactory mixtures as well as to retain individual component information. Next, based on the impressive amount of anatomical and immunochemical studies of the bee brain, I detail our knowledge of olfactory pathways. I then show how functional recordings of odor-evoked activity in the brain allow following the transformation of the olfactory message from the periphery until higher-order central structures. Data from extra- and intracellular electrophysiological approaches as well as from the most recent optical imaging developments are described. Lastly, I discuss results addressing how odor representation changes as a result of experience. This impressive ensemble of behavioral, neuroanatomical, and neurophysiological data available inthe bee make it anattractive model for future research aiming to understand olfactory perception and learning in an integrative fashion. © 2011 Sandoz.","Appetitive learning; Brain circuits; Electrophysiology; Insect; Neural processing; Olfaction; Optical imaging; Perception",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856167100

A total of 44 beehives from 8 apiaries located in Sardinia island (Italy) were involved in this research. Adult bee samples were collected from colonies either showing or lacking the disease symptoms, and the average number of P. larvae spores per adult bee was determined through microbiological culture, followed by bacterial identification through a combination of morphological, biochemical and genetic assays. Correspondence between the detection of disease symptoms in the hives and the number of spores per adult bee samples was obtained. In line with previous studies, the outcome of the present investigation supports the employment of adult bee spore load determination as a tool to get information on the actual health status of the colony. This allows an early detection of AFB disease, especially when clinical symptoms in colonies are still not observable. In addition, the results suggest that a level around 3,000 P. larvae spores per adult bee, obtained with our experimental conditions, might represent a threshold for the appearance of clinical symptoms in the colony.","Adult honey bees; American foulbrood; Apis mellifera ligustica; Diagnosis; Spore load",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82355171072

The obtained results showed that, indigenous bees transferred from traditional hives (Aoud) into Langstroth (modern) hives and supplied with frames contained 33 cells/μ2 (regular worker-size cell for indigenous bees) (group I) had significantly higher brood production and population development than indigenous bees transferred from traditional hives into Langstroth hives and supplied with frames contained 25 cells/μ2 (regular worker-size cell for European bees) (group II) and carniolan bees transferred from honey bee nuclei into Langstroth hives and supplied with frames contained 25 cells/μ2 (regular worker-size cell for European bee) (group III). The general mean of brood area in cm2, frames of brood and frames covered with adult bees were (2813.13, 1730.94 and 1867.05 cm2/colony), (3.13, 2.21 and 2.07 brood comb/colony) and (6.39, 4.44 and 4.38 comb of bees/colony), in groups I, II and III, respectively. The indigenous race significantly surpassed the carniolan race in brood production during summer season during high temperature commonly exceeds 45 °C. Data also showed that no significant difference in foraging activity between the two examined races (indigenous and carniolan race) for gathering pollen during the first inspection period extended from 6 to 7 am during the relatively cold, moderate and very high air temperature during inspection months. This situation differed between the two examined races during the second and third inspection period extended from 11 to 12 am and 4 to 5 pm, relatively high air temperature in June, August and October, during which the indigenous race significantly surpassed the carniolan race in foraging activity for gathering pollen. Moreover, the foraging activity was significantly higher in the first inspection period (6–7 am) than the other two periods (11–12 am and 4–5 pm). When the numbers and percentages of died or superseded queens in the three inspection groups (I, II and III) were studied, no died or superseded queens were found in honey bee colonies in group (I) during the experimental period which was extended from March, 2009 to March, 2010. However, the percentages of failed queens during the experimental period were 0.00%, 45.00% and 60.00% in groups (I, II and III), respectively. The results also showed that increasing the size of the worker cells negatively affected brood production and population density in indigenous race and indigenous race is more tolerant and well adapted to the environmental conditions in the search area than carniolan race (imported). Therefore, this study recommends that improving the characteristics of indigenous and carniolan races should take place through breading programs, because the indigenous race shows high ability and good adaptation to the environmental conditions in the area but it is small in size, in addition their honey stomach and pollen basket are small, meanwhile the carniolan race is large in size and their honey stomach and pollen basket are great, but is not acclimatized to environmental conditions in the region, especially during the hot summer when the air temperature exceeds 45 °C. © 2012","Apis mellifera carnica; Apis mellifera jementica; Brood rearing; Foraging activity; Honey bees; Population development; Queen superseding",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873024160

Vitellogenin is associated with fecundity in queens and plays a major role in controlling division of labour in workers, thereby affecting both individual and colony-level fitness. We studied the molecular evolution of vitellogenin and seven other genes sequenced in a large population panel of Apis mellifera and several closely related species to investigate the role of social pleiotropy on adaptive protein evolution. We found a significant excess of nonsynonymous fixed differences between A. mellifera, A. cerana and A. florea relative to synonymous sites indicating high rates of adaptive evolution at vitellogenin. Indeed, 88% of amino acid changes were fixed by selection in some portions of the gene. Further, vitellogenin exhibited hallmark signatures of selective sweeps in A. mellifera, including a significant skew in the allele frequency spectrum, extreme levels of genetic differentiation and linkage disequilibrium. Finally, replacement polymorphisms in vitellogenin were significantly enriched in parts of the protein involved in binding lipid, establishing a link between the gene's structure, function and effects on fitness.

Each device held a tube containing one of five colored fluorescent powders, or a combination of a fluorescent powder (either green or magenta) plus one of two protein powders, resulting in nine unique marks. The powdered protein markers included egg albumin from dry chicken egg whites and casein from dry powdered milk. The efficacy of the marking procedure for each of the unique markers was assessed on honey bees exiting each apiary. Each bee was examined, first by visual inspection for the presence of colored fluorescent powder and then by egg albumin and milk casein specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Data indicated that all five of the colored fluorescent powders and both of the protein powders were effective honey bee markers. However, the fluorescent powders consistently yielded more reliable marks than the protein powders.

In the present study, we cloned the cDNAs encoding the Apis PDF precursor protein, and found that there are at least seven different pdf mRNAs yielded by an alternative splicing site and five alternative polyadenylation sites in the 5′UTR and 3′UTR regions. The amino acid sequence of Apis PDF peptide has a characteristic novel amino acid residue, aspargine (Asn), at position 17. Quantitative real-time PCR of total and 5′UTR insertion-type pdf mRNAs revealed, for the first time, that the expression levels change in a circadian manner with a distinct trough at the beginning of night in LD conditions, and at the subjective night under DD conditions. In contrast, the expression level of 5′UTR deletion-type pdf mRNAs was about half of that of the insertion type, and the expression profile failed to show a circadian rhythm. As the expression profile of the total pdf mRNA exhibited a circadian rhythm, transcription regulated at the promoter region was supposed to be controlled by some of the clock components. Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed that 14 lateral neurons at the frontal margin of the optic lobe express these mRNA isoforms. PDF expressing cells examined with a newly produced antibody raised against Apis PDF were also found to have a dense supply of axon terminals in the optic lobes and the central brain. © 2011 Zoological Society of Japan.","Apis mellifera; cDNA cloning; circadian rhythm; honeybee; immunocytochemistry; in situ hybridization; neuropeptide; pigment-dispersing factor; real-time PCR",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82955223307

Nosema causes significant losses in honey production and the virus decreases population size. We initiated a survey of honey bee colonies on the blooming period of Acacia to determine the prevalence of Nosema and virus in 2011. Most Korean beekeepers have moved from the south to north of Korea to get Acacia nectar for 2 mon. This provided a valuable opportunity to sample bees originating from diverse areas in one location. Twenty hives owned by 18 beekeepers were sampled in this year. Nosema spore counts ranged from zero to 1,710,000 spores per bee. The average number of nosema spores per bee was 580,000. Approximately 95% of the colonies were infected with Nosema, based on the presence of spores in the flowering period of Acacia. This indicates that Nosema is the predominant species affecting honeybee colonies. Also, the seven most important honeybee viruses were investigated by reverse transcription-PCR. Among them, four different viruses were detected in samples. Black queen cell virus was present in all samples. Chronic bee paralysis virus was detected in 10% of samples. Deformed wing virus was present in only 5% of the samples. Prevalence of Sacbrood virus was 15%.

This may influence colony performance via effects on worker behaviour. The effects of experimental wing damage were studied in worker honeybees in observation hives by recording survivorship, how often and for how long bees foraged, and by decoding waggle dances. Mortality rate increased with both age and wing damage. Damaged bees carried out shorter and/or less frequent foraging trips, foraged closer to the hive, and reported the profitability of flower patches to be lower than did controls. These results suggest that wing damage caused a reduction in foraging ability, and that damaged bees adjusted their foraging behaviour accordingly. Furthermore, the results suggest that wing damage affects the profitability of nectar sources. These results have implications for the colony dynamics and foraging efficiency in honeybees.

So far 19 different viruses have been discovered in honey bees (Apis mellifera), but most of them do not cause clinically detectable infection. The recent scientific data confirmed that viruses together with other pathogens such as Varroa destructor and Naosema sp. play an important role in the occurrence of bee colony losses, weak honey bee colonies and shortened life of bees. Carniolan honey bee (Apis mellifera carnica) is, due to the special status of protected species, benefiting from increasing attention of researchers. On the Veterinary Faculty, University of Ljubljana certain methods for detection of bee viruses were introduced between 2007 and 2011. Two hundred and twelve samples collected from bee colonies, queens and brood have been collected in weakened and healthy colonies from all region of Slovenia. Using the molecular methods seven different viruses could be detected. In one sample, we demonstrated the detection of Kashmir bee virus (KBV) for the first time, but Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) we have not yet identified to be established. In a study of the detection of bee viruses by RT-PCR method in 2010, acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) was detected in 35% of samples, black queen cell virus (BQCV) in 88.8% of examined samples, chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) in 15.3%, deformed wing virus (DWV) in 76.6% and sac brood bee virus (SBV) in 2.5% of the examined samples. With the development of new methods and approaches for the detection of viral infections, and with monitoring of clinical manifestations in honey bee colonies, the real impact of virus infections on the life of Carniolan honey bee will be evaluated.","Carniolan honey bee; Detection of bee virus infections; Viral diseases of bees",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892858715

Because the survival of a honeybee colony depends on the exploitation of food sources, forager bees learn and memorize variable flower sites as well as their profitability. Forager bees can be easily trained in natural settings where they forage at a feeding site and learn the related signals such as odor or color. Appetitive associative learning can also be studied under controlled conditions in the laboratory by conditioning the proboscis extension response (PER) of individually harnessed honeybees(3,4). This learning paradigm enables the study of the neuronal and molecular mechanisms that underlie learning and memory formation in a simple and highly reliable way(5-12). A behavioral pharmacology approach is used to study molecular mechanisms. Drugs are injected systemically to interfere with the function of specific molecules during or after learning and memory formation(13-16).

Using honey bee Deformed wing virus (DWV) as a model, we conducted field and laboratory studies to investigate the roles of abiotic and biotic stress factors as well as host health conditions in dynamics of virus replication in honey bees. The results showed that temperature decline could lead to not only significant decrease in the rate for pupae to emerge as adult bees, but also an increased severity of the virus infection in emerged bees, partly explaining the high levels of winter losses of managed honey bees, Apis mellifera, around the world. By experimentally exposing adult bees with variable levels of parasitic mite Varroa destructor, we showed that the severity of DWV infection was positively correlated with the density and time period of Varroa mite infestation, confirming the role of Varroa mites in virus transmission and activation in honey bees. Further, we showed that host conditions have a significant impact on the outcome of DWV infection as bees that originate from strong colonies resist DWV infection and replication significantly better than bee originating from weak colonies. The information obtained from this study has important implications for enhancing our understanding of host-pathogen interactions and can be used to develop effective disease control strategies for honey bees. © 2011 by the authors.","Bee; Temperature; Varroa; Viruses; Vitellogenin",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84255204854

Typically, chemical treatment is essential to control the parasite population in the honey bee colony. Nevertheless a few honey bee populations survive mite infestation without any treatment. We used one such Varroa mite tolerant honey bee lineage from the island of Gotland, Sweden, to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling reduced mite reproduction. We crossed a queen from this tolerant population with drones from susceptible colonies to rear hybrid queens. Two hybrid queens were used to produce a mapping population of haploid drones. We discriminated drone pupae with and without mite reproduction, and screened the genome for potential QTL using a total of 216 heterozygous microsatellite markers in a bulk segregant analysis. Subsequently, we fine mapped three candidate target regions on chromosomes 4, 7, and 9. Although the individual effect of these three QTL was found to be relatively small, the set of all three had significant impact on suppression of V. destructor reproduction by epistasis. Although it is in principle possible to use these loci for marker-assisted selection, the strong epistatic effects between the three loci complicate selective breeding programswith theGotland Varroa tolerant honey bee stock. © 2011 The Authors.","Disease resistance; Drones; Microsatellites; Quantitative trait loci",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867540690

During nectar and pollen foraging in a temperate climate, honeybees are exposed to a broad range of ambient temperatures, challenging their thermoregulatory ability. The body temperature that the bees exhibit results from endothermic heat production, exogenous heat gain from solar radiation, and heat loss. In addition to profitability of foraging, season was suggested to have a considerable influence on thermoregulation. To assess the relative importance of these factors, the thermoregulatory behaviour of foragers on 33 flowering plants in dependence on season and environmental factors was investigated. 2. The bees (Apis mellifera carnica Pollman) were always endothermic. On average, the thorax surface temperature (Tth) was regulated at a high and rather constant level over a broad range of ambient temperatures (Tth = 33.7-35.7°C, Ta = 10-27°C). However, at a certain Ta, Tth showed a strong variation, depending on the plants from which the bees were foraging. At warmer conditions (Ta = 27-32°C) the Tth increased nearly linearly with Ta to a maximal average level of 42.6 °C. The thorax temperature excess decreased strongly with increasing Ta (Tth-Ta = 21.6 - 3.6°C). 3. The bees used the heat gain from solar radiation to elevate the temperature excess of thorax, head, and abdomen. Seasonal dependance was reflected in a 2.7 °C higher mean Tth in the spring than in the summer. An anova revealed that season had the greatest effect on Tth, followed by Ta and radiation. 4. It was presumed the foragers' motivational status to be the main factor responsible for the variation of Tth between seasons and different plants. © 2011 The Authors.

Its use is permitted by law in Argentine and USA, but not in the EU countries, apart from specific cases under veterinary authorization. So far, the optimal dosage of this active ingredient in controlling Nosema ceranae has not been determined. The aim of the present work was to assess the efficiency of different fumagillin dosages on Apis mellifera colonies affected by different N. ceranae intensity. For this purpose, during April and May of 2007, in an apiary located near the Mar del Plata city (Buenos Aires Province, Argentine), forty eight A. mellifera colonies reared in Langhstroth hives, each containing 8 to 10 adult bee combs, were used in order to evaluate the effectiveness of different doses of fumagillin. The colonies were divided into those with mild or semi-severe disease intensity, based on the number of Nosema spores estimated in a sample of 60 returning bees (arb, spores abundance in returning bee). Then the colonies were randomly distributed forming 6 experimental groups (3 with mild intensity: one untreated left as control and the other two treated with 102 mg of fumagillin in two and three doses, respectively; 3 with semi-severe intensity: treated with 102 mg of fumagillin in two and three doses, and with 120 mg of fumagillin in four doses, respectively). Each dose was administered at intervals of 7 days. Before and during each administration, for a period of 35 days, the number of frames covered with adult bees was recorded in each hive and a sample of 100 workers per colony was collected from the hive entrance in order to determine the abundance (arb) and prevalence (prb) of spores. This alternative parameter (prb) was calculated by examining a sub-sample of 10 bees, crushing the propodeum of the bees in 0.5 ml distilled water, taking a drop of suspension and observing 20 fields under a optic microscope (450x) for spore absence (0) or presence (1); then the estimation of spores prevalence (prb) was recorded as percentage of spore presence in the 20 observed fields, and the average of two estimates were used. Moreover, spores from 5 randomly selected colonies were molecularly characterized to confirm the Nosema species. The sequencing results showed a 98% of homology with N. ceranae. The results obtained allow to establish that the efficiency of fumagillin in controlling Nosemosis type C caused by N. ceranae is affected by the intensity of the disease rather than from dosage or way of application. The best result was obtained when colonies were affected by a mild intensity and the drug was administered in two weekly doses of 51 mg per hive.","Antibiotic; Apis mellifera; Fumagillin; Microsporidian; Nosema ceranae",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863899050

However, this fact is more evident in earlier commercial hybrids. There are reports that suggest that bees are not required in modern commercial hybrids where a high level of self-compatibility occurs. The purpose of this study was to define formation capacity of fully developed fruits (FDF) and incompletely developed fruits (IDF) in two modern sunflower hybrids exposed to open and closed pollination.Two hybrids, one of half cycle and the other of short cycle, labelled HA and HB respectively, were submitted to two pollination regimes: auto-pollination (bagged treatment) where the heads were covered with mesh bags from the first anthesis (FA) to the last anthesis (LA), avoiding the action of pollinators and open pollination (open treatment). The study was conducted during three consecutive years in two different locations. In the first year, the experimental plots were located at the Chacra experimental Barrow (Tres Arroyos; 38°20' S; 60°13' W) and in the second and third year at the experimental field of Universidad Nacional del Sur, (Bahía Blanca; 38°45' S; 62°11' W), reaching an average plant density of 60.000 plants/ha. During the second year treatments were conducted only on the HA and during the third year only on the HB. The number of FDF and IDF, in the three experiments on both sites did not show significant differences among treatments. Nevertheless, a non-significant different response in the number of FDF and IDF was observed during two years, probably as a result of changes in environmental conditions during the anthesis period. We conclude that, due to the effect of a high level of self-compatibility, no differences in the generation of fully developed fruits can be observed when plants of modern commercial sunflower hybrids are excluded from pollinators.","Fruit set; Helianthus annuus; Pollination; Self compatibility; Sunflower; Yield",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860495254

Honeybee workers mix their own waxes and β-glucosidase with resins collected from plants, and use it as a sealant and antimicrobial agent to construct and protect their hives. Propolis has been used as a folk medicine since ancient times. Currently, it is used as an alternative medicine due to its broad spectrum of biological activities, such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, immunomodulatory, and others. At present more than 300 constituents of propolis, mainly polyphenols (flavonoids, phenolic acids, esters, aldehydes and ketones) have been identified. Flavonoids have been suggested as the key compounds, contributing to its biological activities. The chemical composition of propolis varies considerably depending on the geographical and botanical origins, greatly influencing species and contents of flavonoids, thereby affecting the biological properties of propolis.

In addition, the single harvest method of honey was compared to the partial method. Partial harvest method permitted a higher production of honey (P≤0.05) than the single method. This result was observed for the 2 types of hives and seems related to the increase of space in the hives when the partial harvest method was used. This factor should stimulate the queen bee to intensify its laying activity and the worker bees to gather more nectar. Results revealed that the evolution of the brood and the honey production were better (P≤0.05) for the Langstroth hive.

Honeybees are social insects that show a high level of organisation and very complex behaviour. This includes the coordination of foraging efforts thanks to their sophisticated mechanism of advertising and recruitment, which includes the well-known waggle dance. This foraging process is needed for general pollination and makes honeybees crucial for a sustainable environment. There exists previous work in the area of honeybee modelling and simulation. Some simulator models use such a fine resolution that can only run for real-time hours. Other work is focused on simply replicating a published observation. Instead, we are interested in simulating long time periods (e.g. months) and learning how the foraging spread patterns and distributions can affect the local flora or contribute to the transmission of diseases or parasites. The main motivation for this work is to support the decision making process in the Biosecurity context. Biosecurity plays a key role in the economic viability of Australia's plant industries due to the devastating effects that plant pests and diseases can cause. Hence, the importance of preventing the spread of diseases between apiaries or to a disease free area (e.g. Fire Blight (Erwinia amylovora) is a serious disease in many fruits and uses honeybees as one of its main vectors for transmission). The simulator is Web based1 so that users do not have to install or update software, or worry about enough computational power or platform compatibility. The user interface allows the introduction of the simulation parameters (e.g. spatial resolution and size, model configuration settings, visual specification of the simulation environment on the map) and receive a detailed results report. A simulation of several weeks usually takes a few seconds to complete. The simulation model is stochastic and discrete in time with 1-trip time steps, which is approximated by difference equations. It is also explanatory, meaning that its behavioural rules depend on well-established entomological knowledge. It can support any number of beehives and floral patches over a two dimensional landscape of unrestricted size and varying resolution. The main simulation model has four interrelated models that include i) a spatial model that represents the landscape to simulate by a grid of cells; ii) a flora model that represents a patch with a number of flowers and seasons defined by nectar quality and quantity; iii) a weather model that considers time periods of temperature and daily hours of light; iv) a foraging model, which represents the foraging behaviour of a honeybee colony.","Biosecurity management.; Foraging; Honeybee; Simulation modelling; Spatio-temporal model",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858851678

Although pollution is among the possible causes of the widely observed pollinator loss, it is still poorly investigated and no studies are known, so far to test the effects of heavy metal contamination in bumblebees (Bombidae) - the second most important group of managed pollinators after honey bees (Apis mellifera Linneaus). We have tested heavy metal (Pb, Cd, and Zn) accumulation, species diversity and parasite load (focusing on the common Nosema bombi Fantham and Porter, Microsporidia: Nosematidae) in bumblebees. For this purpose, we have chosen three heavy metal gradients (Guryevsk, Belovo and Olkusz) and two additional control sites (Kouznetskiy Alatau and Gornaya Shoria). All gradients were approximately 20 km long, starting in close proximity (1.3 km or less) of an active zinc or metal smelter, and each consisting of 5 sites located on semi-natural or degraded meadows in various distance from the smelter. On each site min. 50 bumblebees were caught by sweep nets, each individual identified to species level and next, its abdomen homogenized and used for assessment of N. bombi infestation. Heavy metal levels in soil of the tested gradients varied between (Pb: 13.6-814.2 mg kg -1, Cd: 0.14-20.3 mg kg -1, Zn: 67.0-889.3 mg kg -1) Bumblebees accumulated Pb and Cd (Pb: 0.21-3.3 mg kg -1, Cd: 0.002-0.069 mg kg -1) in their bodies. The content of these metals in bumblebee bodies correlated with their content in soil (Pb: P &lt;0.01, Cd: P = 0.002). However, no correlation was found between the Zn contents in bumblebees (Zn: 74.7-81.9 mg kg -1) and the soil. We have also found that the metal contents in soil or in the bodies of bumblebees caused no changes in species diversity or dominance on polluted sites, irrespective of type and the level of contamination. The variation of Shannon diversity (H'), as well as Simpson's diversity (D) were similar in all studied sites and ranged from 0.543 to 0.81 and from 0.152 to 0.484 respectively. The proportion of infected individuals was generally not higher than 0.29 and did not differ significantly among the studied sites. Incidentally, based on variation in the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU-rRNA) gene, we have found a new strain of Nosema bombi in the Kouznetskiy Alatau and Gornaya Shoria (West Siberia, Kemerovo Region) samples.

The chemical composition of such perfumes in males with either two or three mandibular teeth has previously led to the discovery of two sympatric, cryptic lineages within Euglossa viridissima Friese on the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. Here, we combine chemical, morphological, and genetic data for an integrated characterization of the two lineages. The lectotype of E. viridissima Friese in the Museum of Natural History in Vienna has two mandibular teeth, and the species name viridissima must thus be assigned to the predominantly bidentate lineage, whereas the completely tridentate lineage is described as a novel species, Euglossa dilemma sp. nov. Bembé & Eltz. Chemical profiling and microsatellite genotyping revealed that E. viridissima males can occasionally (~10% of individuals) express a third mandibular tooth, but this tooth is not positioned centrally on the mandible as in E.dilemma, but is displaced towards the tip. Thus, males of the two lineages can be unambiguously diagnosed by mandibular characters alone. Based on 889bp of CO1 sequence data, we confirm that E. viridissima and E. dilemma constitute a monophyletic group within the genus Euglossa. However, CO1 alone failed to separate these two lineages due to the lack of parsimony-informative sites. Both species occur in broad sympatry across Central America, but the orchid bees recently introduced to Florida have three mandibular teeth in males, i.e. belong to E.dilemma. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London.","Apinae; Chemotaxonomy; Cryptic diversity; Pheromone analogue; Reinforcement; Reproductive character displacement; Sister species; Speciation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052447187

Nasonia is well situated for comparative analyses of DNA methylation and genome evolution, since the genomes of a moderately distant outgroup species as well as closely related sibling species are available. Using direct sequencing of bisulfite-converted DNA, we uncovered a substantial level of DNA methylation in 17 of 18 Nasonia vitripennis genes and a strong correlation between methylation level and CpG depletion. Notably, in the sex-determining locus transformer, the exon that is alternatively spliced between the sexes is heavily methylated in both males and females, whereas other exons are only sparsely methylated. Orthologous genes of the honeybee and Nasonia show highly similar relative levels of CpG depletion, despite ∼190 My divergence. Densely and sparsely methylated genes in these species also exhibit similar functional enrichments. We found that the degree of CpG depletion is negatively correlated with substitution rates between closely related Nasonia species for synonymous, nonsynonymous, and intron sites. This suggests that mutation rates increase with decreasing levels of germ line methylation. Thus, DNA methylation is prevalent in the Nasonia genome, may participate in regulatory processes such as sex determination and alternative splicing, and is correlated with several aspects of genome and sequence evolution. © 2011 The Author.","alternative splicing; DNA methylation; genome evolution; molecular evolution; Nasonia; sex determination",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81855206226

Recent outbreaks of Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) has caused loss of more than 35% of bee colonies in the USA, and this is thought to at least in part be due to parasites and/or disease. Interestingly, the honeybee possesses of a limited set of immune genes compared to other insects. Non-canonical immune genes of honeybee are of interest because they may provide greater insights into the peculiar nature of the immune system of this social insect. Previous analyses of bee haemolymph upon bacterial challenge identified a novel leucine-rich repeat protein termed IRP30. Here we show that IRP30 behaves as a typical secreted immune protein. It is expressed simultaneously with carboxylesterase upon treatment with bacteria or other elicitors of immune response. Furthermore we characterize the gene and the mRNA encoding this protein and the IRP30 protein itself. Its regulation and evolution reveal that IRP30 belongs to a protein family, distributed broadly among Hymenoptera, suggesting its ancient function in immune response. We document an interesting case of a recent IRP30 loss in the ant Atta cephalotes and hypothesize that a putative IRP30 homolog of Nasonia emerged by convergent evolution rather than diverged from a common ancestor. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Carboxylesterase; Haemolymph; Honeybee; Hymenoptera; Innate immunity; Phylogeny",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80355131963

Later analyses showed that these colonies had been fed during the winter with a inverted sugar syrup from sugar beet which had a high concentration of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). HMF concentrations ranged from 18.8ppm to 365.6ppm. Data from the scientific literature are quite limited, but several authors confirm the harmful effect of HMF on honey bee health. Other elements, however, may have played a role in this apparent mortality such as crystallization of syrups, resulting in unavailability of sugar for the honey bees, and thus the death of them from starvation. Pending the acquisition of new scientific knowledge on the subject, it is recommended to follow good beekeeping practices detailed in this article to minimize the formation of HMF in syrups for honey bee feeding. In addition, a draft action limit corresponding to a maximal concentration of 40ppm of HMF is proposed in order to control the risk at the producer and distributor of syrups for honey bee feeding level.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876312162

For decades, it has been known that nutrition and juvenile hormone (JH) signaling determine the caste fate of the individual bee. However, it is still largely unclear how these factors are connected. To address this question, we suppressed nutrient sensing by RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene knockdown of IRS (insulin receptor substrate) and TOR (target of rapamycin) in larvae reared on queen diet. The treatments affected several layers of organismal organization that could play a role in the response to differential nutrition between castes. These include transcript profiles, proteomic patterns, lipid levels, DNA methylation response and morphological features. Most importantly, gene knockdown abolished a JH peak that signals queen development and resulted in a worker phenotype. Application of JH rescued the queen phenotype in either knockdown, which demonstrates that the larval response to JH remains intact and can drive normal developmental plasticity even when IRS or TOR transcript levels are reduced. We discuss our results in the context of other recent findings on honey bee caste and development and propose that IRS is an alternative substrate for the Egfr (epidermal growth factor receptor) in honey bees. Overall, our study describes how the interplay of nutritional and hormonal signals affects many levels of organismal organization to build different phenotypes from identical genotypes. © 2011.

This paper presents a novel algorithm based on artificial bee colony (ABC) to deal with multi-objective optimization problems. ABC is one of the most recently introduced algorithms based on the intelligent foraging behavior of a honey bee swarm. It uses less control parameters, and it can be efficiently used for solving multimodal and multidimensional optimization problems. Our algorithm uses the concept of Pareto dominance to determine the flight direction of a bee, and it maintains nondominated solution vectors which have been found in an external archive. The proposed algorithm is validated using the standard test problems, and simulation results show that the proposed approach is highly competitive and can be considered a viable alternative to solve multi-objective optimization problems.

Consequently, new adaptive duel strategies may be generated. The fights between s-b-q died down in 15 h and even more important, s-b-q ceased aggression (long-lasting) not only towards their fight opponents but also towards any stranger queen. Hence, the new active fight-avoidance behavior was generated. Such behavior happened because the aversive abstract rule s' learning imprinted the long-lasting information in the brains of the ineffective dueling s-b-q, as if to say: ""I have no chance to win"". Duels between s-b-q and non-sting blunted queens (n-s-q) have shown that in most of the pairs, s-b-q began fights three times later than n-s-q. Self-assessment of fight abilities in the sting deprived queens was proved in this way. There were no fights between young (virgin) and old egg-laying queens. After pair reconstruction (young + old), fighting was initiated both in the newly created young-queen and old queen pairs. Thus, the fight aversive stimulations are necessary to generate the fight avoidance behaviour. Habituation, emotional abstract rule learning and selfassessment were involved in this phenomenon. Both physical disabilities and the learning of abstract rules can produce fight retreaters or avoiders.","Abstract learning; Apis mellifera; Habituation; Queen duels; Self-assessment",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855878180

Previous studies of pollen digestion in birds have yielded highly variable and often contradictory results. We tested whether these differences could reflect the vastly different methodologies that have been used. We used a standard method to investigate digestion of Banksia grandis (Proteaceae) pollen in New Holland honeyeaters (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae). Four types of B. grandis pollen were examined: fresh, frozen for a week, stored in conditions to stimulate pregermination for 24h, or collected by honeybees. Our data indicate that although pollen treatment may influence digestibility of the pollen grains, these differences do not reach statistical significance because they are dwarfed by a high degree of variability between birds fed the same diet as well as variability in gut transit time (generally more pollen grains were digested over longer transit times). Similar patterns were observed for red wattlebirds (Anthochaera carunculata) fed bee-collected pollen. We believe that feeding behaviour or gut transit time may explain the marked differences between previous studies of pollen digestion by nectarivores, particularly the conflicting results for New Holland honeyeaters. © CSIRO 2011.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862007027

In addition to indicating the position (distance, direction) of a food patch, both the occurrence and frequency of the dances depend on the profitability of the exploited resource (sugar concentration, solution flow rate). During the waggle dance, successful foragers generate pulsed thoracic vibrations that putatively serve as a source of different kinds of information for hive bees, who cannot visually decode dances in the darkness of the hive. In the present study, we asked whether these vibrations are a reliable estimator of the excitement of the dancer when food profitability changes in terms of both sugar concentration and solution flow rate. The probability of producing thoracic vibrations as well as several features related to their intensity during the waggle phase (pulse duration, velocity amplitude, duty cycle) increased with both these profitability variables. The number of vibratory pulses, however, was independent of sugar concentration and reward rate exploited. Thus, pulse number could indeed be used by dance followers as reliable information about food source distance, as suggested in previous studies. The variability of the dancer's thoracic vibrations in relation to changes in food profitability suggests their role as an indicator of the recruiter's motivational state. Hence, the vibrations could make an important contribution to forager reactivation and, consequently, to the organisation of collective foraging processes in honey bees. © 2011.

In this study, the influence of sugar dusting treatments on hygienic behavior was evaluated in 44 strong honey bee colonies. Three doses of pulverized sugar, 20, 30 and 40 g, each applied at three-, seven- and fourteen-day intervals were tested. The percentage of cleaned cells (PCC) in the total number of those with pin-killed brood served as a measure of the hygienic potential. The effect was dependent on the frequency of treatments: all doses applied every third and seventh day significantly (p<0.001) decreased the PCC in comparison with the untreated control colonies. Nevertheless, sugar did not threaten the hygienic potential, as PPC values remained above 94% following all treatments. Thus, it can be concluded that the tested sugar treatments are safe and can be justifiably implemented into integrated pest management strategies to control Varroa destructor.","Apis mellifera; Hygienic behavior; Safe treatments; Sugar dusting; Varroa destructor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857979356

However, little is known about the neural circuits that perform the visual motor computations that underlie this ability. We investigated the motor neurons that innervate two neck muscles (m44 and m51), which produce stabilizing yaw movements of the head. Intracellular recordings were made from five (out of eight) identified neuron types in the first cervical nerve (IK1) of honeybees. Two motor neurons that innervate muscle 51 were found to be direction-selective, with a preference for horizontal image motion from the contralateral to the ipsilateral side of the head. Three neurons that innervate muscle 44 were tuned to detect motion in the opposite direction (from ipsilateral to contralateral). These cells were binocularly sensitive and responded optimally to frontal stimulation. By combining the directional tuning of the motor neurons in an opponent manner, the neck motor system would be able to mediate reflexive optomotor head turns in the direction of image motion, thus stabilising the retinal image. When the dorsal ocelli were covered, the spontaneous activity of neck motor neurons increased and visual responses were modified, suggesting an ocellar input in addition to that from the compound eyes. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Direction selective; Head movement; Insect; Temporal tuning",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81555198401

Studies of the highly eusocial honey bee have shown that nutritional physiology and some conserved nutrient signalling pathways, especially the insulin pathway, also regulate the division of labour between foraging and non-foraging individuals. Typically, lean workers leave the nest to forage for food, and well-nourished workers perform tasks inside the nest. Here we provide the first direct test of whether similar mechanisms operate in a primitively eusocial insect in an independently evolved social lineage, the paper wasp Polistes metricus. We found that food deprivation caused reduced lipid stores and higher levels of colony and individual foraging. Individuals with greatly reduced lipid stores foraged at extremely elevated levels. In addition, brain expression of several foraging-related genes was influenced by food deprivation, including insulin-like peptide 2 (ilp2). Together with previous findings, our results demonstrate that nutrition regulates foraging division of labour in two independently evolved social insect lineages (bees and wasps), despite large differences in social organization. Our results also provide additional support for the idea that nutritional asymmetries among individuals, based on differences in nutritional physiology and expression of conserved nutrient signalling genes in the brain, are important in the division of labour in eusocial societies. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","foraging; gene expression; insulin pathway; nutrition; social behaviour",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82955239971

The fruit of the açai palm is an important source of anthocyanins, which are also phenolics of the flavonoid group. The aim of this study was to assess the antioxidant and antimicrobial effects of a mixture of propolis and açai extracts. Antimicrobial activity was assessed by BHI broth culture with diluted extract, followed by agar subculture, while antioxidant activity was assessed by the DPPH radical scavenging assay. The results showed that around 2% of the propolis extract showed antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis, while low concentrations of both the ethanolic propolis and aqueous açai extracts, alone and combined, exhibited antioxidant activity. In conclusion, this study showed that the antioxidant effects of propolis and açai were summed in the mixed extracts. Furthermore, this combination would show antimicrobial activity if the minimum inhibitory concentration of propolis extract established in this study were used in the formulation. Hence, these extracts could be mixed into formulations used topically to prevent skin aging and, possibly, disorders caused by microbes, such as acne.","Açai; Antimicrobial; Antioxidant; DPPH radical; Flavonoids; Propolis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860860300

The chapter will include a review of relevant articles about structure and function of these organs to provide knowledge of social insect biology with emphasis in larvae and adults of bees, as in Apis mellifera as in Meliponini. This section of the chapter will discuss the basic tissue architecture of midgut and Malpighian tubules and some differences according species and groups. Since the histology and ultra-morphology of midgut and Malpighian tubules are well characterized, any modification in their structure and function or in the physiological process of programmed cell death, induced by xenobiotics, can be diagnosed. The midgut and Malpighin tubules of larvae and adults of bees are involved in the absorption an excretion of chemical compounds, respectively, an assessment of their morphology can reveal ultrastructural alterations induced by environmental stressors such as pesticides.

In the honeybee's olfactory system, sensory input is first processed in the antennal lobe (AL) network. Uniglomerular projection neurons (PNs) convey the sensory code from the AL to higher brain regions via two parallel but anatomically distinct pathways, the lateral and the medial antenno-cerebral tract (l- and m-ACT). Neurons innervating either tract show characteristic differences in odor selectivity, concentration dependence, and representation of mixtures. It is still unknown how this differential stimulus representation is achieved within the AL network. In this contribution, we use a computational network model to demonstrate that the experimentally observed features of odor coding in PNs can be reproduced by varying lateral inhibition and gain control in an otherwise unchanged AL network. We show that odor coding in the l-ACT supports detection and accurate identification of weak odor traces at the expense of concentration sensitivity, while odor coding in the m-ACT provides the basis for the computation and following of concentration gradients but provides weaker discrimination power. Both coding strategies are mutually exclusive, which creates a tradeoff between detection accuracy and sensitivity. The development of two parallel systems may thus reflect an evolutionary solution to this problem that enables honeybees to achieve both tasks during bee foraging in their natural environment, and which could inspire the development of artificial chemosensory devices for odor-guided navigation in robots. © 2011 Schmuker, Yamagata, Nawrot and Menzel.","Antennal lobe; Computational model; Dual pathway odor coding; Insect olfactory system; Intensity-identity tradeoff",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855588292

Thus, the investigation of humoral and cellular immune responses to sPLA 2s from different species can provide a suitable model in the study of antibody and T-cell cross-reactivity. Methods: Specific IgE, IgG 1, IgG 4, and IgA antibodies were analyzed by ELISA against sPLA 2s from pancreas of Bos taurus (BT), Apis mellifera (AM) bee venom, Daboia russellii (DR) and Naja mossambica (NM) snake venoms, and human group III (hGIII) sPLA 2 using sera of nonallergic beekeepers, AM-allergic patients, and healthy controls. T-cell cross-reactivity was investigated in PBMC, and T-cell clones (TCC) are generated against AM sPLA 2. Results: Hyperimmune and allergic individuals showed high levels of sPLA 2-specific IgG 4 and significant IgG 4 cross-reactivity between BT, DR, and NM sPLA 2s. Furthermore, IgE, IgA, and IgG 1 cross-reactivities against BT, DR, and NM sPLA 2s were also detectable in the range of 22.2-44.8%. Allergic patients showed significant T-cell proliferative response to NM sPLA 2 together with increased IFN-γ and IL-13 production even though they had never been exposed to cobra venom. Although nonallergic healthy controls show no cross-reactivity at T-cell level, they did have low levels of IgG 4 and IgA against BT, DR, and NM sPLA 2s. Human TCC spanning three major T-cell epitopes of AM sPLA 2 showed minor proliferative response to NM and hGIII sPLA 2s. Conclusions: This study shows that T cells and antibodies may show cross-reactivity between different species without being naturally exposed to sPLA 2s. © 2011 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.","Allergy; Bee venom; Cross-reactivity; Phospholipases A 2; Snake venom",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82955195717

The inter-annual phenophase variability (start, first bee pasture, pasture on black locust and pasture on linden) is high - variation interval is from 44 to 86 days. With time analysis it was established that as a result of higher air temperatures and earlier plant phenophases also the bee phenophases appear earlier in the last period. Statistically significant linear trend for the first bee pasture is -19 day/decade, for pasture on black locust it is -10 day/decade. Phenophase pasture on linden has no statistically significant trend. The correlation between phenological development and air temperature was studied with correlation analysis. The correlation coefficient values are between -0.45 and -0.70. All three phenophases are best correlated with average monthly temperatures in March and April. Simple regressions models for the prediction of the start of phenophases on the basis of air temperature were developed. As the models explanatory variables average monthly air temperatures and thermal time needed for an individual phenophase start were included. The accumulated thermal time was calculated as the sums of active temperatures (the sum of positive temperatures from January 1) and effective temperatures (the sum of temperatures above the temperature threshold 10 °C from February 28). The variability coefficients (KV) for the calculated thermal time are between 15 per cent and 43 per cent. With backward selection linear regression models for the prediction of time of the first bee pasture and pasture on black locust were formed. With the models we were able to explain 53 per cent to 91 per cent of variability at the start of phenophases.","Bees; Phenophases; Regression models; Thermal time; Trends",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879866923

For A. cerana, the PCA revealed that light intensity was the most important limiting factor. In most cases, A. cerana foragers had more departure flights per unit time and spent more time flying than foragers of L. hoozana. The minimum flight temperatures for L. hoozana ranged from 11°C to 16 °C, and were higher than the minimum flight temperatures of 8 °C to 10 °C for A. cerana.

This lack is particularly evident in Copepoda, given the extraordinary numerical abundance, and taxonomic and ecological diversity of this group. Tigriopus californicus is ideally suited to serve as a genetic model copepod and has been the subject of extensive work in environmental stress and reproductive isolation. Accordingly, we set out to develop a broadly-useful panel of genetic markers and to construct a linkage map dense enough for quantitative trait locus detection in an interval mapping framework for T. californicus--a first for copepods.Results: One hundred and ninety Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to genotype our mapping population of 250 F 2larvae. We were able to construct a linkage map with an average intermarker distance of 1.8 cM, and a maximum intermarker distance of 10.3 cM. All markers were assembled into linkage groups, and the 12 linkage groups corresponded to the 12 known chromosomes of T. californicus. We estimate a total genome size of 401.0 cM, and a total coverage of 73.7%. Seventy five percent of the mapped markers were detected in 9 additional populations of T. californicus. Of available model arthropod genomes, we were able to show more colocalized pairs of homologues between T. californicus and the honeybee Apis mellifera, than expected by chance, suggesting preserved macrosynteny between Hymenoptera and Copepoda.Conclusions: Our study provides an abundance of linked markers spanning all chromosomes. Many of these markers are also found in multiple populations of T. californicus, and in two other species in the genus. The genomic resource we have developed will enable mapping throughout the geographical range of this species and in closely related species. This linkage map will facilitate genome sequencing, mapping and assembly in an ecologically and taxonomically interesting group for which genomic resources are currently under development. © 2011 Foley et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81355160984

Pesticides or environmental effects may target the biochemistry of insect chitin and cuticle coating. Denaturing of chitin involves a combination of deacetylation, intercalation, oxidation, Schweiger-peeling, and the formation of amine hydrochloride salt. The term ""denatured chitin"" calls attention to structural and property changes to the internal membranes and external carapace of organisms so that some properties affecting biological activities are diminished. Methodology/Principal Findings: A case study was performed on honey bees using silver staining and microscopic computer-tomographic x-ray radiography (micro-CT). Silver nitrate formed counter-ion complexes with labile ammonium cations and reacted with amine hydrochloride. Silver was concentrated in the peritrophic membrane, on the abdomen, in the glossa, at intersegmental joints (tarsi), at wing attachments, and in tracheal air sacs. Imaged mono-esters and fatty acids from cuticle coating on external surfaces were apparently reduced by an alcohol pretreatment. Conclusions/Significance: The technique provides 3-dimensional and sectional images of individual honey bees consistent with the chemistries of silver reaction and complex formation with denatured chitin. Environmental exposures and influences such as gaseous nitric oxide intercalant, trace oxidants such as ozone gas, oligosachharide salt conversion, exposure to acid rain, and chemical or biochemical denaturing by pesticides may be studied using this technique. Peritrophic membranes, which protect against food abrasion, microorganisms, and permit efficient digestion, were imaged. Apparent surface damage to the corneal lenses of compound eyes by dilute acid exposure consistent with chitin amine hydrochloride formation was imaged. The technique can contribute to existing insect pathology research, and may provide an additional tool for research on CCD. © 2011 Peter R. Butzloff.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-81155134399

The 5'SAGE approach provides a powerful tool for identifying TSSs in the sequenced genome. The main purpose of this study is to identify the actual TSSs of expressed genes as well as the usage of different TSSs in the Apis mellifera genome. We performed a 5'LongSAGE (5'LS) analysis for the adult drone head, and the TSSs of the expressed genes were determined by mapping the 5'LS tag sequences to the honeybee genome. A total of 8,280 unique 19bp 5'LS tag sequences were identified that corresponded to 3,655 predicted genes. Out of these tags, 4,998 tags (60.4%) were mapped to a region from -1,000bp to +100bp of the start codon of 2,301 reference coding sequences. Notably, we observed that 28-47% of the 3,655 honeybee genes initiated transcription from alternative TSSs. The TSS consensus pattern of the honeybee genes, DT richPyPu(G rich)(T/A)(T rich) 3, was obtained by aligning the sequences flanking the 5'LS-TSSs. We also identified three new genes in the regions downstream of 5'LS tags and validated 21 TSSs using RT-PCR amplification. Additionally, 17 genes identified by the 5'LS tags were associated with the Gene Ontology term ""behavior."" Mapping of the 5'LS tags on the genome not only provided direct evidence of expression for in silico predicted genes but also allowed for the identification of previously unrecognized, novel exons and alternative TSSs. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054892786

Here, we show that two existing valuation methods, previously thought to be unrelated, are each a special case of a more general equation. We then present a new method, termed attributable net income, for valuing insect pollination of crops. The attributable net income method improves upon previous methods in three ways: (1) it subtracts the cost of inputs to crop production from the value of pollination, thereby not attributing the value of these inputs to pollinators; (2) it values only the pollination that would be utilized by the crop plant for fruit production, thereby not valuing pollen deposited in excess of the plants' requirements; and (3) it can attribute value separately to different pollinator taxa, for example to native vs. managed pollinators. We demonstrate all three methods using a data set on watermelon pollination by native bees and honey bees in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, USA. We discuss the reasons why different methods produce disparate values, and why the attributable net income method most accurately reflects the actual ecosystem service that is being valued, marketable fruit production. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Apis mellifera; Biodiversity-ecosystem function; Ecosystem service valuation; Ecosystem services; Native bee; Pollinator; Valuation; Wild bee",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80055056449

One of these genes, referred to in honey bees as Amdop2, shows a close phylogenetic relationship to the a-adrenergic-like octopamine receptor family. In this study we examined in parallel the functional and pharmacological properties of AmDOP2 and the honey bee octopamine receptor, AmOA1. For comparison, pharmacological properties of the honey bee dopamine receptors AmDOP1 and AmDOP3, and the tyramine receptor AmTYR1, were also examined. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using HEK293 cells heterologously expressing honey bee biogenic amine receptors, we found that activation of AmDOP2 receptors, like AmOA1 receptors, initiates a rapid increase in intracellular calcium levels. We found no evidence of calcium signaling via AmDOP1, AmDOP3 or AmTYR1 receptors. AmDOP2- and AmOA1-mediated increases in intracellular calcium were inhibited by 10 μM edelfosine indicating a requirement for phospholipase C-β activity in this signaling pathway. Edelfosine treatment had no effect on AmDOP2- or AmOA1-mediated increases in intracellular cAMP. The synthetic compounds mianserin and epinastine, like cis-(Z)-flupentixol and spiperone, were found to have significant antagonist activity on AmDOP2 receptors. All 4 compounds were effective antagonists also on AmOA1 receptors. Analysis of putative ligand binding sites offers a possible explanation for why epinastine acts as an antagonist at AmDOP2 receptors, but fails to block responses mediated via AmDOP1. Conclusions/Significance: Our results indicate that AmDOP2, like AmOA1, is coupled not only to cAMP, but also to calcium-signalling and moreover, that the two signalling pathways are independent upstream of phospholipase C-β activity. The striking similarity between the pharmacological properties of these 2 receptors suggests an underlying conservation of structural properties related to receptor function. Taken together, these results strongly support phylogenetic analyses indicating that the AmDOP2 and AmOA1 receptor genes are immediate paralogs. © 2011 Beggs et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80855133578

The aim of the study was to optimize the formulation of candy taking 1 honey as one of the ingredients. Optimization of candy ingredients was done using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The independent variables were honey, butter, starch, Skim Milk Powder (SMP) and pectin. The responses were moisture content, hardness and yellowness index. The proportions of ingredients taken were honey (10-50%), butter (0-30%), starch (10-40%), SMP (0-24%) and pectin (0-6%). The formulated ingredients were blended and heat treated at 85°C for 7 min. The cooked candy was then cooled to 15°C, molded, wrapped with aluminum foil and kept for physico-chemical analysis. It was evident from statistical analysis that moisture content increased with the increase in honey level. Butter had a negative correlation with the moisture content along with pectin. Hardness decreased with the increase in honey level. Butter and pectin followed the negative correlation with hardness. Yellowness index increased with the increase in honey level where as it decreased with the increase in starch as well as skim milk powder level. Contour plots and response surfaces were developed for each response. Optimum values were predicted by superimposition of contours of each response by keeping standard values for each response in view. The optimum combination found were honey 44, butter 15, starch 25, SMP 12% and pectin 5.55%.

In this study we estimate recombination rate in a eusocial wasp Vespula vulgaris that represents a third phylogenetic lineage within eusocial hymenopterans.Results: A genetic linkage map of V. vulgaris based on 210 markers shows that the total map length is 2129 cM and the recombination rate is 9.7 cM/Mb (or 103 kb/cM). The present estimate in V. vulgaris is somewhat smaller than in the honeybee Apis mellifera and intermediate between the estimates from two ant species (Acromyrmex echinatior, Pogonomyrmex rugosus). Altogether, the estimates from these eusocial species are higher than in any other insect reported so far.Conlusions: The four species (V. vulgaris, A. mellifera, A. echinatior, P. rugosus) are characterized by advanced eusociality with large colonies, clear queen-worker dimorphism and well developed task specialization. They also have colonies with a single, normally multiply inseminated (polyandrous) queen. Benefits of genotypic diversity within colonies (e.g. through improved task specialization or pathogen and parasite resistance) may have selected for both polyandry and high recombination rate in such advanced eusocial insects. © 2011 Sirviö et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80155137343

Honey bees were observed to have an even distribution across the parent lines, although individual bees largely maintained fidelity to the particular line on which they foraged.

Many factors have been evoked to explain the losses, among which are the presence of residues of pesticides and veterinary products in hives. Multiple residues are present at the same time, though most often in low concentrations so that no single product has yet been associated with losses. Involvement of a combination of residues to losses may however not be excluded. To understand the impact of an exposure to combined residues on honey bees, we propose a mechanism-based strategy, focusing here on Multi-Drug Resistance (MDR) transporters as mediators of those interactions. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using whole-animal bioassays, we demonstrate through inhibition by verapamil that the widely used organophosphate and pyrethroid acaricides coumaphos and τ-fluvalinate, and three neonicotinoid insecticides: imidacloprid, acetamiprid and thiacloprid are substrates of one or more MDR transporters. Among the candidate inhibitors of honey bee MDR transporters is the in-hive antibiotic oxytetracycline. Bees prefed oxytetracycline were significantly sensitized to the acaricides coumaphos and τ-fluvalinate, suggesting that the antibiotic may interfere with the normal excretion or metabolism of these pesticides. Conclusions/Significance: Many bee hives receive regular treatments of oxytetracycline and acaricides for prevention and treatment of disease and parasites. Our results suggest that seasonal co-application of these medicines to bee hives could increase the adverse effects of these and perhaps other pesticides. Our results also demonstrate the utility of a mechanism-based strategy. By identifying pesticides and apicultural medicines that are substrates and inhibitors of xenobiotic transporters we prioritize the testing of those chemical combinations most likely to result in adverse interactions. © 2011 Hawthorne, Dively.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80355136437

Individual organisms display consistent differences in their ""impulsivity,"" and vary in their tendency to make rapid, impulsive choices as opposed to slower, more accurate decisions. However, we do not yet know whether groups of animals consistently differ in their tendency to prioritize decision speed over accuracy. We challenged 17 swarms of honey bees (Apis mellifera) to simultaneously choose a new nest site in each of three locations, and measured their decision speeds in each trial. We found that swarms displayed consistent personality differences in the number of waggle dances and shaking signals they performed and in how actively they scouted for new nest sites. However, swarms did not consistently differ in how long they took to choose a nest site. We suggest that house-hunting A. mellifera swarms may place an especially high emphasis on decision accuracy when choosing a nest site, and that chance events-such as the time when each swarm discovers a sufficiently high-quality nest site-may consequently play a greater role in determining a swarm's decision speed than intrinsic characteristics such as a swarm's ""impulsivity."" © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Collective decision-making; Honey bees; Nest-site selection; Personality differences; Speed-accuracy tradeoff; Swarm cognition",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053953448

In the first experiment, we studied the spatial distribution within confinement sites of six beetle species at eight time intervals following their introduction into honey bee observation hives. For each beetle species, we also determined whether the beetle's level of integration into honey bee colonies correlated with its ability to hide at confinement sites within colonies. In experiment 1, we used five species of nitidulid beetles and one species of tenebrionid beetle, collectively representing three differing levels of integration into honey bee colonies. These species (and their level of integration) included Aethina tumida (highly integrated), Lobiopa insularis, and Epuraea luteola (accidentals), and Carpophilus humeralis, C. hemipterus, and Tribolium castaneum (non-integrated). There were always more A. tumida found in confinement sites than beetles of the other species. This difference became more pronounced over the 24-h observation period. In experiment 2, we determined whether previous A. tumida occupation of confinement sites predisposed those sites to hosting invading A. tumida never before exposed to honey bee colonies. The results from this study indicate that invading A. tumida find hiding sites within honey bee colonies more rapidly if other A. tumida previously occupied the confinement sites. Collectively, these studies suggest that A. tumida is unique among beetle invaders with respect to its ability to seek out and occupy confinement sites inside honey bee colonies. © 2011 International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).","Aethina tumida; Apis mellifera; Confinement behavior; Nitidulidae; Small hive beetle; Tenebrionidae",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052593791

Managed honey bees are highly social, frequent a multitude of environmental niches, and continually share food, conditions that promote the transmission of parasites and pathogens. Additionally, commercial honey bees used in agriculture are stressed by crowding and frequent transport, and exposed to a plethora of agricultural chemicals and their associated byproducts. When considering this problem, the hive of the honey bee may be best characterized as an extended organism that not only houses developing young and nutrient rich food stores, but also serves as a niche for symbiotic microbial communities that aid in nutrition and defend against pathogens. The niche requirements and maintenance of beneficial honey bee symbionts are largely unknown, as are the ways in which such communities contribute to honey bee nutrition, immunity, and overall health. In this review, we argue that the honey bee should be viewed as a model system to examine the effect of microbial communities on host nutrition and pathogen defense. A systems view focused on the interaction of the honey bee with its associated microbial community is needed to understand the growing agricultural challenges faced by this economically important organism. The road to sustainable honey bee pollination may eventually require the detoxification of agricultural systems, and in the short term, the integrated management of honey bee microbial systems. © 2011 International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI) (outside the USA).","Extended organism; Microbial ecology; Pathogen defense; Social insects; Symbiosis",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052568117

In response, honey bees evolved several adaptations to face the increased risks of epidemic diseases. As the antimicrobial venom peptides of Apis mellifera are present both on the cuticle of adult bees and on the nest wax it has been recently suggested that these substances act as a social antiseptic device. Since the use of venom by honey bees in the context of social immunity needs to be more deeply investigated, we extended the study of this potential role of the venom to different species of the genus Apis (A. mellifera, Apis dorsata, Apis cerana and Apis andreniformis) using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry techniques. In particular we investigated whether (similarly to A. mellifera) the venom is spread over the body cuticle and on the comb wax of these three Asian species. Our results confirm the idea that the venom functions are well beyond the classical stereotype of defence against predators, and suggest that the different nesting biology of these species may be related to the use of the venom in a social immunity context. The presence of antimicrobial peptides on the comb wax of the cavity-dwelling species and on the cuticle of workers of all the studied species represents a good example of "" collective immunity"" and a component of the "" social immunity "" respectively. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","A. andreniformis; A. cerana; A. dorsata; A. mellifera; Collective immunity; MALDI-TOF MS",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82555197962

A novel CRH-BP gene AccCRH-BP from Apis cerana cerana was identified and characterized. Its genomic DNA was consisted of seven exons and six introns, and shared high similarity with the homologous members from other insects and vertebrates. Homologous and phylogenetic analysis indicated that AccCRH-BP was highly conserved, suggesting the maintenance of conservative structure might be necessary for its biological function. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that AccCRH-BP was highly expressed in pupa and adult, especially in the head of pupa. However, there was no expression in larval stage. Furthermore, the transcripts of AccCRH-BP in the brain of honeybees were induced by exposure to environmental stresses including UV-light, heat, and cold. The expression level of AccCRH-BP in workers or queens was significantly higher than that of drones. Additionally, analysis of 5'-flanking region of AccCRH-BP revealed a number of putative development and stress transcription factor-binding sites. These data suggest that AccCRH-BP may play important roles in the regulation of honeybee development, and in the central nervous system of the brain to regulate the neuroendocrine stress responses. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Apis cerana cerana; CRH-BP; Development; Neuroendocrine stress responses; Real-time quantitative PCR",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054717411

To investigate nuclear microsatellites population structure in A. cerana, single workers of A. cerana colonies from Thailand were genotyped at 18 microsatellite loci. The loci showed intermediate to high levels of heterozygosity and a range of allele numbers. The analyses confirmed a fundamental subdivision of the Thai A. cerana population into the ""Asia Mainland"" and ""Sundaland"" regions at the Isthmus of Kra. However, the nuclear microsatellite differentiation was less distinct than mtDNA haplotype differences, suggesting male-biased dispersal and population admixture. Overall, samples showed a weak isolation-by-distance effect. The isolated population on Samui island was most differentiated from the other samples. The results do not support our initial hypothesis of local host-pathogen co-evolution, which predicts a strict correspondence between the nuclear genome and the lineage of parasitic Varroa mite of the A. cerana samples, because the gene flow indicated by our nuclear microsatellite markers should also mix potential Varroa resistance alleles among subpopulations. Instead, our study suggests that the coincidental distribution of Varroa lineages and A. cerana population structure in Thailand are the result of biogeographic history and current migration patterns. © 2011 International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).","Biogeography; Co-evolution; Local adaptation; Microsatellites; Population structure",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052589212

Our main aim was to determine how nest site requirements affect the bees' decision-making process. We either calculated our model parameters from experimental data or chose them so that our model would generate similar numbers of dancing bees and dance followers to those observed in real swarms with access to an abundance of suitable nest sites in all directions. We found that A. florea is less capable of making a collective decision on a new nest site when the area occupied by suitable sites is small compared to when suitable sites are abundant. Increasing the use of information regarding the location of potential nest sites or the accuracy of the information available enhanced the decision-making ability of A. florea when nest sites were scarce. We also found that swarm guidance might be hindered when suitable nest site areas are wide apart. We therefore examined two possible mechanisms for increasing directional agreement among dancers: mimicry of unverified dance information and self-regulation by inhibiting or changing dance behaviour based on observations of other dances. We show that, even at low levels, dance mimicry greatly enhances the ability of an A. florea swarm to make a decision and reduces the time to make a decision. However, in the presence of mimicry errors propagate through the swarm. Self-regulation had little or no effect, probably because of the overall low levels of dance activity present on the swarm at any given time. Our model results suggest that A. florea's decision-making process allows swarms to locate a new nest site provided nest sites are abundant, even when they are of similar quality. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Agent-based model; Apis florea; Decentralized decision making; Waggle dance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054760985

Despite being productive, they are highly aggressive and cause fatal accidents. This study aimed to evaluate patients at the Clinical Hospital of Botucatu Medical School (HC-FMB) and to propose treatment guidelines. Methods: From 2005 to 2006, the clinical and laboratorial aspects of 11 patients (7 male and 4 female) and the anatomopathological aspects of one patient who had died in 2003 were analyzed. Results: The age of the surviving patients varied from 5 to 87 years, with a mean of 42.5 years. The majority of accidents occurred in the afternoon, and the number of stings ranged from 20 to 500. The principal signs and symptoms were pain and local inflammatory signs, nausea, tachycardia, and vomiting. Biochemical findings presented increased levels of creatine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate/alanine aminotransferase. An 11-year-old male patient died upon entering the attic of a two-storey building where he was attacked by a swarm, receiving more than 1,000 stings. He was sent to HC-FMB where he was treated, but he died 24h later. Observed at the autopsy were erythematous-purpuric skin lesions besides necrosis at the sting locations, rhabdomyolysis, focal myocardial necrosis, tubular hydropic degeneration and focal tubular acute necrosis of the kidneys, myoglobinuria, and centrolobular necrosis in the liver. Conclusions: Accidents caused by multiple AHB stings always constitute a medical emergency. As there is no specific antivenom, we have developed guidelines, including first aid, drugs, and the proper removal of stingers.","Africanized honeybee stings; Apis mellifera; Treatment guidelines",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855827325

Insect pollinators represent such examples; the introduction of commercial bumble bee species for crop pollination has resulted in competition for an ecological niche with native species, genetic disturbance caused by mating with native species, and pathogen spillover to native species. The European honey bee, Apis mellifera, was first introduced into Japan for apiculture in 1877, and queen bees have been imported from several countries for many years. However, its effects on Japanese native honey bee, Apis cerana japonica, have never been addressed. We thus conducted the survey of honey bee viruses and Acarapis mites using both A. mellifera and A. c. japonica colonies to examine their infestation in native and non-native honey bee species in Japan. Honey bee viruses, Deformed wing virus (DWV), Black queen cell virus (BQCV), Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), and Sacbrood virus (SBV), were found in both A. mellifera and A. c. japonica colonies; however, the infection frequency of viruses in A. c. japonica was lower than that in A. mellifera colonies. Based on the phylogenies of DWV, BQCV, and SBV isolates from A. mellifera and A. c. japonica, DWV and BQCV may infect both honey bee species; meanwhile, SBV has a clear species barrier. For the first time in Japan, tracheal mite (Acarapis woodi) was specifically found in the dead honey bees from collapsing A. c. japonica colonies. This paper thus provides further evidence that tracheal-mite-infested honey bee colonies can die during cool winters with no other disease present. These results demonstrate the infestation of native honey bees by parasite and pathogens of non-native honey bees that are traded globally. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80255133248

We studied the rare perennial herb Dictamnus albus as a model plant, with the aim of describing the plant-pollinator system from both plant and pollinator perspectives and analysing features that promote outcrossing in an entomophilous species. The breeding system and reproductive success of D. albus were investigated in experimental and natural conditions, showing that it is potentially self-compatible, but only intra-inflorescence insect-mediated selfing is possible. Nectar analysis showed gender-biased production towards the female phase, which follows the male phase, and during flowering, full blooming is found in flowers at the bottom of the raceme. Among a wide spectrum of insect visitors, three genera (Bombus, Apis, Megachile) were found to be principal pollinators. A study of insect behaviour showed a tendency towards bottom-to-top flights for the most important pollinators Bombus spp. and Apis mellifera: upward movements on the racemes could be explained by foraging behaviour, from more to less rewarding flowers. In accordance with the 'declining reward hypothesis', bumblebees and honeybees leave the plant when gain of reward is low, after which few flowers are visited, reducing the chance of self-pollen transfer among flowers. Intra-flower self-pollination is prevented in D. albus by protandry and herkogamy, while the nectar-induced sequential pattern of pollinator visits avoids geitonogamy and tends to maximise pollen export, promoting outcrossing. All these features for preventing selfing benefit plant fitness and population genetic structure. © 2011 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","Breeding system; Dictamnus albus; Foraging behaviour; Gender-biased nectar production; Plant-pollinator interaction; Pollinator behaviour",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053915042

Most of these studies look at individual factors related to colony losses. In contrast, we here present our data on the interaction of pathogens and parasites in honey bee colonies. We performed a longitudinal cohort study over 6 years by closely monitoring 220 honey bee colonies kept in 22 apiaries (ten randomly selected colonies per apiary). Observed winter colony losses varied between 4.8% and 22.4%; lost colonies were replaced to ensure a constant number of monitored colonies over the study period. Data on mite infestation levels, infection with viruses, Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae, and recorded outbreaks of chalkbrood were continuously collected. We now provide statistical evidence (i) that Varroa destructor infestation in summer is related to DWV infections in autumn, (ii) that V. destructor infestation in autumn is related to N. apis infection in the following spring, and most importantly (iii) that chalkbrood outbreaks in summer are related to N. ceranae infection in the preceding spring and to V. destructor infestation in the same season.

This bee is, however, a poor pollinator of several crops compared with native insects. Indeed, honey bees can displace native pollinators and reduce their diversity. The present study evaluated the potential impacts of A. mellifera on the diversity of native pollinators of highland coffee (Coffea arabica) and its putative consequences for coffee production at the state of Veracruz, Mexico. 2 The abundance of A. mellifera and diversity of native pollinators were assessed during blooming at 12 shade coffee plantations and pollination experiments were conducted to determine the impacts of pollinators on coffee fruit production. Regression analyses were used to assess whether the abundance of honey bees was related to native pollinator diversity, and whether fruit production was influenced by both the diversity of pollinators and the abundance of A. mellifera. 3 Native pollinator diversity decreased as the number of honey bees increased. Furthermore, although coffee fruit production was positively related to the diversity of native pollinators, an increasing abundance of A. mellifera was correlated with a decrease in fruit production. 4 Highland shade coffee plantations are considered as reservoirs of the Mexican insect fauna. Thus, native pollinator diversity could be better preserved if beekeepers reduced the number of managed hives that they brought into plantations. This may also help to increase coffee yield by decreasing the putative negative effects of A. mellifera on native pollinators. © 2011 The Authors.

However, virtually all other aspects of invertebrate DNA methylation have remained a mystery until now. Here, using a comparative methylomics approach, we demonstrate that Nematostella vectensis, Ciona intestinalis, Apis mellifera, and Bombyx mori show two distinct populations of genes differentiated by gene-body CpG density. Genome-scale DNA methylation profiles for A. mellifera spermatozoa reveal CpG-poor genes are methylated in the germline, as predicted by the depletion of CpGs. We find an evolutionarily conserved distinction between CpG-poor and GpC-rich genes: The former are associated with basic biological processes, the latter with more specialized functions. This distinction is strikingly similar to that recently observed between euchromatin-associated genes in Drosophila that contain intragenic histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) and those that do not, even though Drosophila does not display CpG density bimodality or methylation. We confirm that a significant number of CpG-poor genes in N. vectensis, C. intestinalis, A. mellifera, and B. mori are orthologs of H3K36me3-rich genes in Drosophila. We propose that over evolutionary time, gene-body H3K36me3 has influenced gene-body DNA methylation levels and, consequently, the gene-body CpG density bimodality characteristic of invertebrates that harbor CpG methylation. © 2011 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80555125018

Following injury, an acute inflammation response takes place resulting in moderate cell necrosis and extracellular matrix damage. Melittin, the major bioactive component in the venom of honey bee Apis mellifera, is a 26-residue amphipathic peptide with well-known cytolytic, antimicrobial and proinflammatory properties. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity of melittin have not been elucidated in liver fibrosis. We investigated whether melittin ameliorates liver inflammation and fibrosis in thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver fibrosis. Two groups of mice were treated with TAA (200 mg/L, in drinking water), one of the groups of mice was co-treated with melittin (0.1 mg/kg) for 12 weeks while the other was not. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were cultured with tumor necrosis factor α in the absence or presence of melittin. Melittin suppresses the expression of proinflammatory cytokines through the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, melittin reduces the activity of HSCs in vitro, and decreases the expression of fibrotic gene responses in TAA-induced liver fibrosis.

We used largescale transcriptomic and proteomic experiments, physiological experiments and RNA interference to explore the mechanistic basis for this lipid loss. Lipid loss was associated with thousands of gene expression changes in abdominal fat bodies. Many of these genes were also regulated in young bees by nutrition during an initial period of lipid gain. Surprisingly, in older bees, which is when maximum lipid loss occurs, diet played less of a role in regulating fat body gene expression for components of evolutionarily conserved nutrition-related endocrine systems involving insulin and juvenile hormone signaling. By contrast, fat body gene expression in older bees was regulated more strongly by evolutionarily novel regulatory factors, queen mandibular pheromone (a honey bee-specific social signal) and vitellogenin (a conserved yolk protein that has evolved novel, maturationrelated functions in the bee), independent of nutrition. These results demonstrate that conserved molecular pathways can be manipulated to achieve stable lipid loss through evolutionarily novel regulatory processes. © 2011.

In these complex systems, pheromones produced by the reproductive individuals (queens) are critical in establishing and maintaining dominant reproductive status over hundreds to thousands of workers. The proximate and ultimate mechanisms by which these intricate pheromone communication systems evolved are largely unknown, though there has been much debate over whether queen pheromones function as a control mechanism or as an honest signal facilitating cooperation. Here, we summarize results from recent studies in honey bees, bumble bees, wasps, ants and termites. We further discuss evolutionary mechanisms by which queen pheromone communication systems may have evolved. Overall, these studies suggest that queen-worker pheromone communication is a multi-component, labile dialog between the castes, rather than a simple, fixed signal-response system. We also discuss future approaches that can shed light on the proximate and ultimate mechanisms that underlie these complex systems by focusing on the development of increasingly sophisticated genomic tools and their potential applications to examine the molecular mechanisms that regulate pheromone production and perception. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Behavior; Chemical communication; Evolution; Genomics; Honey bees; Pheromones; Social insects",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82655184096

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of these transcriptomic profiles showed three clusters that correspond to three ecologically important behavioral categories: aggression, maturation, and foraging. To explore the genetic influences potentially regulating these behavior-specific neurogenomic states, we reconstructed a brain transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) model. This brain TRN quantitatively predicts with high accuracy gene expression changes of more than 2,000 genes involved in behavior, even for behavioral phenotypes on which it was not trained, suggesting that there is a core set of TFs that regulates behavior-specific gene expression in the bee brain, and other TFs more specific to particular categories. TFs playing key roles in the TRN include well-known regulators of neural and behavioral plasticity, e.g., Creb, as well as TFs better known in other biological contexts, e.g., NF-κB (immunity). Our results reveal three insights concerning the relationship between genes and behavior. First, distinct behaviors are subserved by distinct neurogenomic states in the brain. Second, the neurogenomic states underlying different behaviors rely upon both shared and distinct transcriptional modules. Third, despite the complexity of the brain, simple linear relationships between TFs and their putative target genes are a surprisingly prominent feature of the networks underlying behavior.","Apis mellifera; Gene regulation; Social behavior; Systems biology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81055126281

Caste determination is a consequence of environmental conditions during development, during which female larvae may become either queens or workers depending on their larval diet. This bipotency introduces significant variation in the reproductive potential of queen bees, with queens raised from young worker larvae exhibiting high reproductive potential and queens raised from older worker larvae exhibiting lower reproductive potential. We verify that low-quality queens are indeed produced from older worker larvae, as measured morphometrically (e.g., body size) and by stored sperm counts. We also show, for the first time, that low-quality queens mate with significantly fewer males, which significantly influences the resultant intracolony genetic diversity of the worker force of their future colonies.

By contrast, harnessed bees in the laboratory were not thought to be capable of learning a Pavlovian association between a visual stimulus (CS) and sucrose reward (US). For reasons as yet unknown, harnessed bees only learn visual cues in association with sucrose if their antennae are ablated. However, slow acquisition and low retention performances are obtained in this case. Here, we established a novel visual conditioning protocol, which allows studying visual learning and memory in intact harnessed bees in the laboratory. This protocol consists of conditioning the sting extension reflex (SER) by pairing a visual stimulus (CS+) with an electric shock punishment (US), and a different visual stimulus (CS-) with the absence of shock. Bees with intact antennae learned the discrimination between CS+ and CS- by using chromatic cues, achromatic cues or both. Antennae ablation was not only unnecessary for learning to occur but it even impaired visual SER conditioning because of a concomitant reduction of responsiveness to the electric shock. We thus established the first visual conditioning protocol on harnessed honeybees that does not require injuring the experimental subjects. This novel experimental approach opens new doors for accessing the neural correlates of visual learning and memory in honeybees. © 2011.

Ocellar lenses are divided into a dorsal and a ventral part by a cusp-shaped indentation. The retina is also divided, with a ventral retina looking skywards and a dorsal retina looking at the horizon. The focal plane of lenses lies behind the retina in lateral ocelli, but within the dorsal retina in the median ocellus of both workers and drones. Ventral retinula cells are ca. 25μm long with dense screening pigments. Dorsal retinula cells are ca. 60μm long with sparse pigmentation mainly restricted to their proximal parts. Pairs of retinula cells form flat, non-twisting rhabdom sheets with elongated, straight, rectangular cross-sections, on average 8.7μm long and 1μm wide. Honeybee ocellar rhabdoms have shorter and straighter cross-sections than those recently described in the night-active bee Megalopta genalis. Across the retina, rhabdoms form a fan-shaped pattern of orientations. In each ocellus, ventral and dorsal retinula cell axons project into two separate neuropils, converging on few large neurons in the dorsal, and on many small neurons in the ventral neuropil. The divided nature of the ocelli, together with the particular construction and arrangement of rhabdoms, suggest that ocelli are not only involved in attitude control, but might also provide skylight polarization compass information. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Drones; Honeybees; Ocelli; Polarization sensitivity; Rhabdom organization; Workers",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81255187959

The pheromone (180 mg) is contained in a plastic pouch with a pheromone-permeable polyethylene release membrane and a pheromone-impermeable Mylar backing. The pouch is mounted in a solid plastic holder. A 12-replicate, 70-day, single-blind experiment was set up on 4 February 2009 at Abbotsford BC, Canada, to test the utility of SuperBoost for enhancing spring build-up of overwintered honey bee colonies. Colonies were randomly assigned as untreated controls or to be treated with freshly-loaded SuperBoost devices. Devices were replaced once (after 37 days). Supplementary pollen substitute (Bee Pro®) was fed to bees ad libitum. Measurements of BeePro consumption were made on nine occasions. On days 16 and 70 the area of brood comb and numbers of adult bees were determined. When colonies were divided (split), the numbers of daughter colonies were recorded. Two colonies treated with SuperBoost died during the experiment, as did one control colony. SuperBoost devices released 0.37 and 0.54 mg per day of pheromone over the two exposure periods, as determined gravimetrically. By Day 70, treated colonies had consumed 50% more BeePro than control colonies. Treated colonies had significantly more brood comb area (2.4 times) and adults (2.0 times) than control colonies. By day 96, six of the 10 surviving SuperBoost treated colonies had produced nine daughter colonies, a significantly higher proportion than the two of 11 control colonies, which produced four splits. We suggest that SuperBoost has substantial potential for enhancing the spring build-up of overwintered colonies. © IBRA 2011.","Honey bees; Overwintering; Spring buildup; SuperBoost; Synthetic brood pheromone",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81155133330

The mite fall on the bottom board of the hive was scored after the second and seventh day of oxalic acid use. During the treatment with oxalic acid, the colonies included an average of 0.23 dm2 (from 0 to 0.8 dm2) of sealed brood, which can be a source of new populations of mites. The degree of the mite infestation of the sealed brood ranged from 0 to 55% of comb cells with pupae. The efficacy of the treatment was evaluated on the basis of the number of fallen mites after oxalic acid application and the number of fallen mites after a subsequent single fumigation with amitraz (Apiwarol AS). The average efficiency of oxalic acid in removing the parasites was estimated at 69%, which means that a single application of this acid in October reduces infestation but cannot ensure the removal of over 95% of mites, which is the level recommended for medicines.","Honeybee colonies; Oxalic acid; Varroa destructor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82155188412

This may have important consequences for the pollination of crops and native plant species. In Spain, as in other parts of Europe, land abandonment has led to a decrease in the number of non professional beekeepers, which aggravates the problem of honeybee decline as a result of bee diseases In this study, we investigated the effects of honeybees on the pollination of three native plant species in northern Spain, namely wildcherry Prunus avium L., hawthorn Crataegus monogyna Jacq., and bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus L. We quantified fruit set of individuals from the target species along transects established from an apiary outwards. Half the samples were bagged in a nylon mesh to avoid insect pollination. Mixed-effects models were used to test the effect of distance to the apiary on fruit set in non-bagged samples. The results showed a negative significant effect of distance from the apiary on fruit set for hawthorn and bilberry, but no significant effects were detected for wildcherry. This suggests that the use of honeybees under traditional farming practices might be a good instrument to increase fruit production of some native plants. This may have important consequences for wildlife conservation, since fruits, and bilberries in particular, constitute an important feeding resource for endangered species, such as the brown bear Ursus arctos L. or the capercaillie Tetrao urogallus cantabricus L. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Apis mellifera; Bilberry; Cantabrian Mountains; Hawthorn; Pollination; Tetrao urogallus; Ursus arctos; Wildcherry",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054722788

Box 56, Dunedin, New Zealand","The parasitic mite Varroa destructor is responsible for heavy losses in honey bee colonies and represents a major threat to the beekeeping industry. Essential oils offer an attractive alternative to the use of synthetic chemicals for the control of varroa. Amongst them, thymol appears to be particularly promising. However, treatments using thymol as their active substance, such as the gel formulation Apiguard ®, are suspected to have adverse effects on honey bee colonies. In this study, laboratory assays are used to investigate the effects of Apiguard ® exposure on honey bee behaviour. Our results reveal that honey bee responses to this anti-varroa treatment change with honey bee age. While 2-day-old bees respond neutrally to Apiguard ®, older bees generally avoid the Apiguard ® gel. Responses of forager bees were particularly striking. Foragers appear to be repelled by Apiguard ®. Touching their antennae with Apiguard ® induces robust fanning behaviour. Our data suggest, however, that forager bees exposed to Apiguard ® in the hive can become habituated to this treatment. These results offer interesting new perspectives on the effects of Apiguard ® on honey bee behaviour and serve to highlight age-related changes in honey bee responses to gustatory, as well as olfactory cues. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Avoidance; Contact chemoreception; Miticide; Olfaction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80255132666

The orange membranes covering both sides of the mating sign do not touch the hairy rim of the bursa copulatrix. The thin thread at the end of the mating sign is pushed forward on the surface of the sign in most queens. This makes the end of the sign look blunt. Simulated stages of natural mating showed that it is impossible for the orange membranes covering the cornua of the endophallus to become stuck to the mating sign of the same drone. Mating signs with additional pairs of orange membranes were found. In some queens, the semen or additional second mating signs were found at the end of the sign protruding from queen's sting chambers. Those three additional parts originated from drones, which attempted to mate, but failed to remove the mating sign of the predecessor. The thin thread at the end of the mating sign was pushed to the surface of the sign, because the next drone attempted to mate, but failed to remove the sign of its predecessor. The last drone, which failed to mate, left the orange membranes of his endophallic cornua at the mating sign of his predecessor. Thus, the mating sign originates from two drones.

Treatment groups received propolis until killing (at 3 or 6 weeks). X-ray, histological, bone mineral density measurement findings and endogenous antioxidant levels were examined. The bone mineral density was higher, radiological and histological evaluation scores were better, and superoxide dismutase, total glutathione and myeloperoxidase levels were lower among the rats that received oral propolis treatment compared with the controls. In addition, bone mineral density and histological assessment scores showed time-dependent improvement in the treatment group.

Honey samples produced in Venezuela from Melipona species were analyzed using a combination of solid-phase extraction and HPLC-DAD-MSn/ESI methodologies with specific study of the fragment ions produced from flavonoid glycosides. The analyses revealed that flavonoid glycosides were the main constituents. The honey samples analyzed contained a consistent flavonoid pattern composed of flavone-C-glycosides, flavonol-O-glycosides and flavonoid aglycones. The HPLC-DAD-MSn/ESI analysis and the study of the fragment ions obtained allowed the characterization and quantification for the first time of five apigenin-di-C-glycosides, and ten quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin O-glycosides (di- and tri- glycosides), and the aglycones pinobanksin, quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin in the different samples. This is the first report of flavonoid-C-glycosides in honey. The results show that the content of flavonoid-glycosides (mean values of 2712 μg/100. g) in stingless bee honeys is considerably higher than the content of flavonoid aglycones (mean values of 315 μg/100. g). This differs from previous studies on Apis mellifera honeys that consistently showed much higher aglycone content and smaller flavonoid glycoside content. The occurrence of relevant amounts of flavonoid glycosides, and particularly C-glycosides, in stingless bee honeys could be associated with their putative anticataract properties. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Flavonoid C-glycosides; Honey; HPLC-MS; Melipona",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053316831

The protein based substances produced by the hypopharyngeal and Mandibular glands are two important component of the royal jelly, which is responsible for caste differentiation and used to feed larvae, drones and the queen. Several factors may alter the physiology of glandular structures in honeybees and consequently their role within the beehive, and one of the most important factors is their nutritional status. However, few studies have evaluated the development of HG against different diets on Africanized honeybees. Our experiment was composed of four diets (treatments) offered to different groups of workers: (Tl) honey, (T2) honey + soybean extract, (T3) honey + pollen and (T4) sucrose solution. The development °f the glands was evaluated in two periods: 7 and 10 days of exposure to the diet types. According to the results, an interference of the diet on the acini area of the HG was observed. Bees that were fed with the sucrose solution or soybean extract presented the smallest acini areas as compared to the other treatments. Hie time of exposure to the different types of diets also had an effect on acini areas. Worker bees fed with honey and soybean extract for 10 days presented smaller acini areas when compared to bees dissected at the 7th day of exposure to those same diet types. Nevertheless, we also observed that factors other than just nutrition are important to the full development of the HG, such as the stimulus promoted by the young breeds.","Apis mellifera; Hypopharyngeal glands; Nutrition; Pollen; Royal jelly",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890573348

In Brazil this mite does not encounter good conditions for parasitism because weather conditions are not ideal for its maintenance, and some strains of Africanized honey bees are resistant to the parasite. This status is reflected in the low number of dead colonies caused by varroatosis and also the stability of infestation levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the damage caused by mite infestations in hives with higher levels of infestation than the ones considered normal for Brazilian apiaries. The level of infestation in each colony was determined and the mortality rates of parasitized bees during development were periodically recorded. The G Test of Independence and a Test of Proportions were used to compare the data. The rates of mortality of pupae and larvae were mostly proportional to the level of infestation in each colony. All colonies showed mortality rates significantly higher than the control one. In Africanized honeybee colonies with high rates of infestation by Varroa destructor mortality rates varied from 19.27% to 23.28% in pupae ( X = 21.27%) and from 15.71% to 16.15% in larvae {X = 15.93%), against 3.85% and 3.74% in the control colony, respectively. In the parasitized colonies the average rates of mortality caused by the hurtful effects of the mite were, respectively, 5.52 and 4.26 times greater in those two developmental stages. Thus it can be concluded that even in tropical regions, like Brazil, it is necessary to give special attention to the levels of mite infestation (IR), particularly where the IR tends to be higher.","Africanized honeybees; Apis mellifera; Development; Mortality analysis; Varroa destructor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890783936

Samples were taken from feral and managed colonies, aiming to maximise the variation in worker and colony heterozygosity. We quantified worker heterozygosity using microsatellites, and tested the idea that individual worker heterozygosity predicts immune response, measured as the enzymatic activity of an antimicrobial peptide phenoloxidase (PO) and encapsulation response. We found substantial variation in worker heterozygosity, but no significant effects of heterozygosity on PO activity or encapsulation response, either on the individual or colony level. Heterozygosity was found to be higher in workers of feral colonies compared with managed colonies.

However, the relationship between phenotypic plasticity and molecular evolution remains poorly understood. We addressed this issue by investigating the evolution of genes associated with phenotypically plastic castes, sexes, and developmental stages of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta. We first determined if genes associated with phenotypic plasticity in S. invicta evolved at a rapid rate, as predicted under theoretical models. We found that genes differentially expressed between S. invicta castes, sexes, and developmental stages all exhibited elevated rates of evolution compared with ubiquitously expressed genes. We next investigated the evolutionary history of genes associated with the production of castes. Surprisingly, we found that orthologs of caste-biased genes in S. invicta and the social bee Apis mellifera evolved rapidly in lineages without castes. Thus, in contrast to some theoretical predictions, our results suggest that rapid rates of molecular evolution may not arise primarily as a consequence of phenotypic plasticity. Instead, genes evolving under relaxed purifying selection may more readily adopt new forms of biased expression during the evolution of alternate phenotypes. These results suggest that relaxed selective constraint on protein-coding genes is an important and underappreciated element in the evolutionary origin of phenotypic plasticity.","Eusociality; Protein evolution; Sex-biased gene expression; Sexual dimorphism; Social insect",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053169442

Melittin has multiple effects, including anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-inflammatory, in various cell types. However, the anti-apoptotic mechanisms of melittin have not been fully elucidated in hepatocytes. Apoptosis contributes to liver inflammation and fibrosis. Knowledge of the apoptotic mechanisms is important to develop new and effective therapies for treatment of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, liver cancer, and other liver diseases. In the present study, we investigated the anti-apoptotic effect of melittin on transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes. TGF-""1-treated hepatocytes were exposed to low doses (0.5 and 1 μg/mL) and high dose (2 μg/mL) of melittin. The low doses significantly protected these cells from DNA damage in TGF-β1-induced apoptosis compared to the high dose. Also, melittin suppressed TGF-β1-induced apoptotic activation of the Bcl-2 family and caspase family of proteins, which resulted in the inhibition of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. These results demonstrate that TGF-β1 induces hepatocyte apoptosis and that an optimal dose of melittin exerts anti-apoptotic effects against TGF-β1-induced injury to hepatocytes via the mitochondrial pathway. These results suggest that an optimal dose of melittin can serve to protect cells against TGF-β1-mediated injury. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Apoptosis; Hepatocytes; Liver disease; Melittin; TGF-β1",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053133552

By far the most important contribution honey bees make to modern agriculture is the pollination services that they provide. Fifty-two of the 115 leading global food commodities depend on honey bee pollination for either fruit or seed set. Honey bee is the most ideal pollinator, and honey bee industry has played a vital role in maintenance of environment development and protection of ecological equilibrium. At present, propaganda should be vigorously carried out on the role of honey bee pollination in increasing agriculture production and protection of ecological equilibrium. Honey bees are a greatly valued resource all of the world. They are prized for their honey and wax production and depended upon for pollination of many important crops. While globally honey bee populations have been increasing, the rate of increase is not keeping pace with demand. Further, honey bee populations have not been increasing in all parts of the world, and have declined in many nations in Europe and in North America. In recent year, CCD has broken out many times in the global range, and the population number of honey bees has sharply declined, so the situation is worrisome. Managed honey bee populations are influenced by many factors including diseases, parasites, pesticides, the environment, and socio-economic factors. These factors can act alone or in combination with each other. Modern agriculture increasingly depends on the use of chemical substances to control weeds, fungi and arthropod pests to ensure high yields. Honey bees may frequently become exposed to environmental chemicals as a consequence of their foraging activities, and traditionally, the focus of pesticide regulations was more on protection of bees against direct poisoning. However, since the substances that are being used have changed, damage from acute toxicity is not the only threat to bees. Instead, sub-lethal effects such as paralysis, disorientation or behavioral changes, both from short-term and long-term exposure, increasingly come into focus. In contrast to direct poisoning of bees that is apparent and easily observable, sub-lethal effects of pesticides on honey bees and other pollinators are much more difficult to demonstrate. The evolution of beekeeping as a cultural practice and as a profession has resulted in the development and use of techniques that may ultimately reduce the vitality of honey bee colonies. Selective pressures on the bee population are routinely being influenced by management decisions like the regular use of medication to control parasites and diseases, the protection of hives against cold weather, and artificial feeding. Consequently, weak and susceptible colonies are kept alive and given a chance to participate in the reproductive process. Colonies that were treated against diseases or parasites may be selected over non-treated colonies that have been forced to cope with the pathogens, thereby lowering the natural resistance against diseases and other environmental selection factors in the honey bee population. With the development of modern agriculture, the traditional survival conditions for honey bees are destroyed in China, which has threatened the existence and sustainable development of the honeybees, evidenced by the constant substantial decreases in the number of honeybees. This review summarizes the changes in ecological conditions, introduces the main factors affecting the survival of honeybees, analyzes the reasons behind the difficult survival of honeybees, and based on which several countermeasures have been raised to address the problem as well as how to maintain strong honeybee colonies, as a reference for future research.","Diversity; Ecological conditions; Effect; Honeybees",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053924319

In honey bees (Apis mellifera), pollen, which is the main dietary source of proteins, amino acids and lipids, is essential to adult bee physiological development while reducing their susceptibility to parasites and pathogens. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying pollen's nutritive impact on honey bee health remained to be determined. For that purpose, we investigated the influence of pollen nutrients on the transcriptome of worker bees parasitized by the mite Varroa destructor, known for suppressing immunity and decreasing lifespan. The 4 experimental groups (control bees without a pollen diet, control bees fed with pollen, varroa-parasitized bees without a pollen diet and varroa-parasitized bees fed with pollen) were analyzed by performing a digital gene expression (DGE) analysis on bee abdomens.Results: Around 36, 000 unique tags were generated per DGE-tag library, which matched about 8, 000 genes (60% of the genes in the honey bee genome). Comparing the transcriptome of bees fed with pollen and sugar and bees restricted to a sugar diet, we found that pollen activates nutrient-sensing and metabolic pathways. In addition, those nutrients had a positive influence on genes affecting longevity and the production of some antimicrobial peptides. However, varroa parasitism caused the development of viral populations and a decrease in metabolism, specifically by inhibiting protein metabolism essential to bee health. This harmful effect was not reversed by pollen intake.Conclusions: The DGE-tag profiling methods used in this study proved to be a powerful means for analyzing transcriptome variation related to nutrient intake in honey bees. Ultimately, with such an approach, applying genomics tools to nutrition research, nutrigenomics promises to offer a better understanding of how nutrition influences body homeostasis and may help reduce the susceptibility of bees to (less virulent) pathogens. © 2011 Alaux et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053604381

A total of 1000 beesdead after from the bottom of the hive from bee colonies were analyzed. Spores were identified with the use of a light microscope (400-600x magnification). Spores were assigned to species by the multiplex PCR method. The microscopic evaluation revealed the presence of Nosema spp. spores in 803 samples (80.3%). Nosema ceranae spores were observed in 353 positive samples (43.96%), Nosema apis spores were found in 300 samples (37.35%), while 150 samples (19.67%) showed signs of a mixed infection. A multiplex PCR analysis revealed that 806 samples were infested with Nosema spp., of which 206 were affected only by Nosema ceranae, 600 showed signs of mixed invasion, while no samples were infected solely by Nosema apis parasites. In two cases, the presence of spores detected under a light microscope was not confirmed by the PCR analysis. The results of the study indicate that Nosema ceranae is the predominant parasitic species found in post-winter worker bees from the bottom of the hive in the region of Warmia and Mazury.","16S rRNA; Apis mellifera; Multiplex PCR; Nosema apis; Nosema ceranae",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053253584

This disease affects the larval development after having been fed with ""barbatimão"" pollen (Stryphnodendron polyphyllum and Stryphnodendron adstringens); the workers become intoxicated and die between the prepupae and pupae stages. This study verified the effect of pollen substitute on the reduction of Apis mellifera L. mortality, caused by Brazilian sac brood during Stryphnodendron adstringens flowering. Two treatments were used: in treatment one, colonies received pollen substitute weekly (a blend of a soy flour, maize flour and wheat flour of equal proportions). The hives of treatment 2 didn't receive the replacement of pollen substitute, receiving only the pollen found in nature. The hives which were fed with the pollen substitute had significant difference of 93.5% of brood survival viability when compared to non-fed which had 80.4% of survival. The frequency of pollen S. adstringens in pollen traps, in treatment 1, was of 0.21. However, in treatment 2, the frequency was of 4.38, indicating that the hives that were not fed with the substitute showed a higher frequency of pollen of this plant when compared with those who had the artificial diet. The results suggest that supplying with pollen substitute, before and during Stryphnodendron adstringens flowering, is important in reducing the effects of Brazilian sac brood disease.","Artificial feeding; Stryphnodendron adstringens; Toxic pollen",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054974626

In addition, we examined whether foraging activity was affected by either the addition of hives of the honey bee, Apis mellifera L., or by field size. Thirty-five pumpkin (Cucurbita spp.) fields ranging from 0.6 to 26.3 ha, 12 supplemented with A. mellifera hives and 23 not supplemented, were sampled during peak flowering over three successive weeks in 2008 and 2009. Flowers from 300 plants per field were visually sampled for bees on each sampling date. A. mellifera, Bombus impatiens Cresson, and Peponapis pruinosa (Say) accounted for 99% of all bee visits to flowers. A. mellifera and B. impatiens visited significantly more pistillate flowers than would be expected by chance, whereas P. pruinosa showed no preference for visiting pistillate flowers. There were significantly more A. mellifera visits per flower in fields supplemented with A. mellifera hives than in fields not supplemented, but there were significantly fewer P. pruinosa visits in supplemented fields. The number of B. impatiens visits was not affected by supplementation, but was affected by number of flowers per field. A. mellifera and P. pruinosa visits were not affected by field size, but B. impatiens visited fewer flowers as field size increased in fields that were not supplemented with A. mellifera hives. Declining A. mellifera populations may increase the relative importance of B. impatiens in pollinating pumpkins in New York. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.","Bombus impatiens; Cucurbita spp.; Peponapis pruinosa; pollination",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051708305

This contribution reports the presence of A. bombi parasitizing both A. mellifera and Bombus terrestris at a site in Northwestern Argentine Patagonia (Bariloche, close to the border with Chile) and analyses its possible absence in the Pampas region, the most important beekeeping region of the country. In Bariloche, prevalence of A. bombi in A. mellifera was 7.6% in 2009, and 13.6% in 2010, whereas in B. terrestris it was 12.1%. Infections were not detected in 302 bee hives periodically prospected along 3 years (almost 400000 honeybee specimens) in the Pampas. Analysis with the probability program FreeCalc2 suggested a possible absence of A. bombi in this area. Because of high virulence showed in several species of Bombus in the Northern hemisphere, A. bombi should be closely monitored in A. mellifera and in native Bombus species or other Apidae. © 2011 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960502619

Of the 410 participating apiaries, 379 apiaries were included in analyses of seasonal infestation rates and 352 apiaries were included in multivariable regression analysis. The highest infestation rate (86.3%) of T. mercedesae was encountered in autumn, followed by summer (66.5%), spring (17.2%) and winter (14.8%). In autumn, 28.9% (93) of the infested apiaries were in the north (including the northeast and northwest of China), 71.1% (229) were in the central and south (including east, southeast and southwest China), and 306 apiaries (82.9%) were co-infested by both T. mercedesae and Varroa. Multivariable regression analysis showed that geographical location, season, royal jelly collection and Varroa infestation were the factors that influence the intensity of T. mercedesae. The influence of beekeeper's education, time of beekeeping, operation size, and hive migration on the intensity of T. mercedesa was not statistically significant.

Each sensillum on the lancet differs from that on the stylet in terms of their topography and external morphology. The sensory afferents of the campaniform sensilla display slow-adapted firing responses to deformation of the cuticle that would be caused by the action of inserting the sting into a substrate, and their afferent signals induce and/or prolong the stinging response. By contrast, the mechanosensory hairplates are located at basal cuticular plates and on the posterior surface of the lancet valves.

Methods: Api m 10 was produced as soluble, aglycosylated protein in Escherichia coli and as differentially glycosylated protein providing a varying degree of fucosylation in insect cells. IgE reactivity and basophil activation of allergic patients were analyzed. For detection of Api m 10 in different venom preparations, a monoclonal human IgE antibody was generated. Results: Both, the aglycosylated and the glycosylated variant of Api m 10 devoid of cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCD), exhibited IgE reactivity with approximately 50% of HBV-sensitized patients. A corresponding reactivity could be documented for the activation of basophils. Although the detection of the native protein in crude HBV suggested content comparable to other relevant allergens, three therapeutical HBV extracts lacked detectable amounts of this component. Conclusion: Api m 10 is a genuine allergen of A. mellifera venom with IgE sensitizing potential in a significant fraction of allergic patients independent of CCD reactivity. Thus, Api m 10 could become a key element for component-resolved diagnostic tests and improved immunotherapeutic approaches in hymenoptera venom allergy. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Api m 10; cross-reactive carbohydrate determinant; insect venom allergy; recombinant allergens; venom preparation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052680684

Honey is produced primarily from floral nectars, and fructose and glucose are the major components. Overall, the chemical composition of honey varies depending on plant source, season, production methods, and storage conditions. Analytical methods applied to honey generally deal with different topics such as determination of botanical or geographical origin, quality control according to the current standards, and detection of adulteration or residues. Traditional chemical composition analysis and physical properties assessment are routinely performed in commercial trading of honey using time-consuming analytical methods that require considerable sample preparation and analytical skills. Spectroscopic techniques in the infrared (IR) wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum have been used in the food industry to monitor and evaluate the composition of foods and are becoming one of the most attractive and commonly used methods of analysis. This review discusses the use, with advantages and limitations, of IR spectroscopy technologies to evaluate and monitor the composition of honey.

With the advent of high-throughput sequencing, it is possible to map methylomes, i.e. detect methylated CGs on a genome-wide scale. The methylomes sequenced to date reveal a divergence in prevalence and targeting of CG methylation between taxa, despite the conservation of the DNA methyltransferase enzymes that cause DNA methylation. Therefore, interspecific methylation usage is predicted to diverge. In various taxa, this tenet gains support from patterns of CG depletion that can be traced in DNA before methylomes are explicitly mapped. Depletion of CGs in methylated genomic regions is expected because methylated cytosines are subject to increased mutability caused by nucleotide deamination. However, the basis of diverging interspecific methylation usage is less clear. We use insights from the methylome of honeybees (Apis mellifera) to emphasize the possible importance of organismal life histories in explaining methylation usage and the accuracy of methylation prediction based on CG depletion. Interestingly, methylated genes in honeybees are more conserved across taxa than nonmethylated genes despite the divergence in utilization of methylation and the increased mutability caused by deamination. © 2011.

Two insulin receptor genes are present in the released genomes of other social hymenopterans. Limited information is available on the IIS pathway role in ants. The predicted insulin receptor sequences from the recently released draft genome of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are incomplete and biologically significant data are also lacking. To elucidate the role of the IIS pathway in the fire ant, two putative insulin receptors (SiInR-1 and SiInR-2) were cloned; the first InR cDNAs cloned from social insects. Analyses of putative post-translational modification sites in SiInRs revealed the potential for differential regulation. We investigated the transcriptional expression of both receptors at different developmental stages, castes and queen tissues. In last instar larvae and pharate pupae of workers and reproductive, transcriptional abundance of both receptors was negatively correlated with body size and nutritional status. The expression level of both receptors in different queen tissues appears to correlate with requirements for queen reproductive physiology and behaviours.

The study was undertaken in an area of hyperxerophilous caatinga at the Estação Biológica de Canudos, Bahia State, Brazil, from May 2005 to June 2007. The flowers of the three species are disposed in a protogynic dichasium. In J. ribifolia both staminate and pistilate flowers last for about 48 hours and flower opening is diurnal, while in J. mollissima and J. mutabilis the staminate flowers last from 12 to 15 hours and the pistilate flowers from 36 to 48 hours, with flower opening occurring at sunset. Nectar production, pollen viability, and stigma receptivity initiate soon after full opening of both floral types, and sexual activity overlaps until senescence. Nectar production varied throughout the day, with higher production by the pistilate flowers; pollen viability and stigma receptivity during the lifetime of the flower occurred in all three species. Significant differences occurred between the reproductive system treatments of J. mollissima (KW = 59.796), J. mutabilis (KW = 59.058), or J. ribifolia (KW = 63.660). The three species produced fruits by experimental geitonogamy as well as experimental xenogamy, while only J. ribifolia produced fruits by spontaneous geitonogamy. The bees Apis mellifera, Xylocopa frontalis and X. grisescens and the hummingbirds Chlorostilbon lucidus and Anopetia gounellei are potential pollinators for J. mollissima and J. mutabilis and A. mellifera and X. grisescens are potential pollinators for J. ribifolia. The diversity of anthophiles on flowers of the three species allows pollen flow and fruit set. On the other hand asynchronous flowering and differences of flower morphology and anthesis help maintain the reproductive isolation and prevent the loss of interspecific pollen due to sharing of pollinators.","Bees; Floral biology; Melittophily; Ornithophyly; Reproductive system",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856057322

In addition, interactions with pollen vectors were expected to explain the structural complexity of the architecture of these flowers since operative flower strength may be determined by a combination of morphological traits which form part of an intrafloral functional module.MethodsSix papilionate species were studied: Collaea argentina, Desmodium uncinatum, Galactia latisiliqua, Lathyrus odoratus, Spartium junceum and Tipuana tipu. Measurements were made of the strength needed to open keels and the strength that pollinators were capable of exerting. Morphological traits of all petals were also measured to determine which of them could be either mutually correlated or correlated with operative strength and moment of strength and participated in a functional module.Key ResultsIt was observed that pollinators were capable in all cases of exerting forces higher and often several times higher than that needed to access floral rewards, and no association could be detected between floral operative strength and strength exerted by the corresponding pollinators. On the other hand, strong and significant correlations were found among morphometric traits and, of these, with operative strength and moment. This was particularly evident among traits of the keel and the wings, presumably involved in the functioning of the floral moveable mechanism.ConclusionsThough visitors are often many times stronger than the operative strength of the flowers they pollinate, exceptionally weak bees such as Apis mellifera cannot open the strongest flowers. On the other hand, strong correlations among certain petal morphometric traits (particularly between the keel and wings) give support to the idea that an intrafloral module is associated with the functioning of the mechanism of these legume flowers. In addition, the highly significant correlations found across petals support the view of functional phenotypic integration transcending the ontogenetic organization of flower structure. © The Author 2011.","bee; biomechanic; Fabaceae; filtering mechanism; floral phenotypic integration; functional module; legume; papilionate flowers; pollination; strength",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053227330

Civil engineering and electromechanical cost-effectiveness and constraints in an expected stream flow are also considered. The optimisation is driven by an objective function that includes the annual difference between generated energy, operating costs and depreciation costs for both initial investment and operation costs, considering various performance and hydraulic constraints. The HBMO algorithm specifies the annual benefit of generated energy and simultaneously determines the annualised operating cost. The solution includes selection of turbine types, number of turbines, penstock diameter, as well as scheduling the operation of an RoR power plant that results in maximum annualised benefit for a given set of river inflow histograms. The results of the proposed algorithm, which are compared with those of an analytical approach using Lagrange multipliers (LM), highlight the advantages in design, effective operation, ease of application and capability of the proposed HBMO algorithm for solving complex problems of this type.","Economics & finance; Mathematical modelling; Renewable energy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053249746

While the structure of this interaction network keeps the young individuals relatively isolated from the rest of the colony, there are two possible mechanisms that can generate this organizational immunity. A spatial segregation that restricts the young bees to the center of the colony can shield them with equal effectiveness as a behavioral segregation in which old bees choose to interact with young bees less frequently. We test the role of these two mechanisms by determining the interaction frequency between different age groups and testing their correlation with the olfactory sensitivity of different age groups to the cuticular odor of each other. Young bees were found to interact with bees of all age groups with equal frequency, which correlates with their lack of olfactory bias for any specific age, while old bees interacted more with other old bees, which correlates with their higher olfactory sensitivity toward the cuticular odor of old bees. The distribution of olfactory responsiveness was found to be positively skewed for old bees, which provides a mechanistic basis for the heterogeneous connectivity of the interaction network observed in an earlier study. As old bees are more likely to be responsible for introducing a potential disease into the colony from the outside and spreading it via the interaction network, these results suggest that behavioral segregation, mediated by olfactory discrimination, plays an important role in generating the organizational immunity within the honeybee colony. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Cuticular hydrocarbons; Electroantennogram; Honeybees; Interaction network; Organizational immunity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052713511

Peripheral taste detection occurs within cuticular hairs, the chaetic and basiconic sensilla, which host gustatory receptor cells and, usually a mechanoreceptor cell. Gustatory sensilla are mostly located on the distal segment of the antennae, on the mouthparts, and on the tarsi of the forelegs. These sensilla respond with varying sensitivity to sugars, salts, and possibly amino acids, proteins, and water. So far, no responses of receptor cells to bitter substances were found although inhibitory effects of these substances on sucrose receptor cells could be recorded. When bees are free to express avoidance behaviors, they reject highly concentrated bitter and saline solutions. However, such avoidance disappears when bees are immobilized in the laboratory. In this case, they ingest these solutions, even if they suffer afterward a malaise-like state or even die from such ingestion. Central processing of taste occurs mainly in the subesophageal ganglion, but the nature of this processing remains unknown. We suggest that coding tastants in terms of their hedonic value, thus classifying them in terms of their palatability, is a basic strategy that a central processing of taste should achieve for survival. © The Author 2011.

Some beekeepers have suggested that sunflower seeds treated with the insecticide fipronil could be an important factor in causing those losses. Therefore, an in-depth field study has been carried out in two regions of Spain where sunflower production is intense (Cuenca and Andalucía) and where, for some crops and varieties, fipronil has been used as seed insecticide. RESULTS: Samples of adult bees and pollen were analysed for bee pathogens and pesticide residues respectively. Neither fipronil residues nor its metabolites were detected in any of the samples analysed, indicating that short-term or chronic exposure of bees to fipronil and/or its metabolites can be ruled out in the apiaries surveyed. Varroa destructor and Nosema ceranae were found to be very prevalent. CONCLUSION: The combination of the two pathogens could augment the risk of colony death in infected colonies, without fipronil residues exerting a significant effect in the given field conditions. Indeed, in this study the losses observed in apiaries located close to sunflower crops were similar to those in apiaries situated in forested areas with wild vegetation. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.","Colony losses; Fipronil; Honey bee; Nosema ceranae; Pesticides; Varroa destructor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052454272

However, little is known about the molecular basis of this spectacular form of altruism. Here, we compared gene expression patterns between nonreproductive, altruistic workers and reproductive, non-altruistic workers in queenless honeybee colonies using a whole-genome microarray analysis. Our results demonstrate massive differences in gene expression patterns between these two sets of workers, with a total of 1292 genes being differentially expressed. In nonreproductive workers, genes associated with energy metabolism and respiration, flight and foraging behaviour, detection of visible light, flight and heart muscle contraction and synaptic transmission were overexpressed relative to reproductive workers. This implies they probably had a higher whole-body energy metabolism and activity rate and were most likely actively foraging, whereas same-aged reproductive workers were not. This pattern is predicted from evolutionary theory, given that reproductive workers should be less willing to compromise their reproductive futures by carrying out high-risk tasks such as foraging or other energetically expensive tasks. By contrast, reproductive workers mainly overexpressed oogenesis-related genes compared to nonreproductive ones. With respect to key switches for ovary activation, several genes involved in steroid biosynthesis were upregulated in reproductive workers, as well as genes known to respond to queen and brood pheromones, genes involved in TOR and insulin signalling pathways and genes located within quantitative trait loci associated with reproductive capacity in honeybees. Overall, our results provide unique insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying alternative reproductive phenotypes in honeybee workers. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Altruism; Apis mellifera; microarray; reproductive division of labour",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053290846

This research work investigated the effect of the method of harvesting on the quality of honey. The quality attributes investigated include: colour, total solids, viscosity, pH, diastase activity, acidity, sugars, ash, nitrogen, total antioxidants, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) content and microbial properties. The results revealed that the honey samples harvested using modern harvesting method had better quality in terms of ash content, total antioxidants, diastase activity, colour, sugars and microbiological attributes. The lower quality of honey harvested using traditional method could be attributed to the adverse effect of the burning during traditional harvesting on the quality of the honey. It is therefore concluded that modern method of harvesting honey produces better quality of honey and should be encouraged. © 2011 Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).","Honey quality; Modern harvesting; Physico-chemical properties; Traditional harvesting",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054948277

Driven by environmental pressures, animals have evolved adaptations which can give valuable insights into human biomedical conditions. The giraffe by virtue of its extremely long neck has a mean arterial pressure much higher than other mammals. However, the giraffe does not develop vascular damage or heart failure despite its high mean arterial pressure. The giraffe's cardiovascular physiology challenges a number of current concepts concerning the genesis of hypertensive vascular damage in the human. All animals senesce, and, in general, the manifestations of this senescence are similar to the aging features observed in humans. The characteristics of aging in natural animals strongly suggest that the so-called chronic degenerative diseases of humans are not really diseases but actually manifestations of the aging phenotype. Glucose regulation in birds and the naked mole rat has features which mimic the characteristics of the diabetic state, yet these animals do not develop the complications occurring in humans with diabetes. Disruptions in the functioning of the circadian molecular clock are thought to underlie certain neuropsychiatric disorders. The honeybee and the zebrafish have emerged as natural animal models for studying the regulation of molecular clocks and the mechanisms underlying plasticity of circadian rhythms.

In particular, robust laboratory methods for assessing adverse effects on honey bee brood are required. In addition, from a statistical point of view, the shared origin of test individuals must be considered when analysing ecotoxicological data. 2.To improve honey bee in vitro rearing, we adopted a nongrafting method to collect honey bee larvae without direct manipulation. Linear mixed effects model to evaluate LD 50, larvae survival and prepupae weights integrated the colony background of larvae as a random factor into the statistical analyses. The novel rearing approach and appropriate statistical tools for data analyses are illustrated in an in vitro case study on acute oral dimethoate toxicity. 3.We recommend our honey bee larvae collection approach for in vitro larvae-rearing applications, because of (i) a mere 3% background mortality upon the prepupae stage, (ii) a high quantitative capacity and (iii) because of robustness of performance which are great benefits for standardization. 4.The analyses indicate clear adverse effects of dimethoate by a significant survival reduction and prepupae weight reduction.

However, few studies have considered landscape effects on the stability of ecosystem services. We tested whether isolation from florally diverse natural and semi-natural areas reduces the spatial and temporal stability of flower-visitor richness and pollination services in crop fields. We synthesised data from 29 studies with contrasting biomes, crop species and pollinator communities. Stability of flower-visitor richness, visitation rate (all insects except honey bees) and fruit set all decreased with distance from natural areas. At 1km from adjacent natural areas, spatial stability decreased by 25, 16 and 9% for richness, visitation and fruit set, respectively, while temporal stability decreased by 39% for richness and 13% for visitation. Mean richness, visitation and fruit set also decreased with isolation, by 34, 27 and 16% at 1km respectively. In contrast, honey bee visitation did not change with isolation and represented >25% of crop visits in 21 studies.

High levels of each of the honeybee silk proteins can be produced recombinantly by fermentation in Escherichia coli. In this study we have used electrospinning to fabricate a single recombinant honeybee silk protein, AmelF3, into nanofibers of around 200 nm diameter. Infrared spectroscopy found that the molecular structure of the nanofibers was predominantly coiled coil, essentially the same as native honeybee silk. Mats of the honeybee nanofibers were treated with methanol or by water annealing, which increased their β-sheet content and rendered them water insensitive. The insoluble mats were degraded by protease on a time scale of hours to days. The protease gradually released proteins from the solid state and these were subsequently rapidly degraded into small peptides without the accumulation of partial degradation products. Cell culture assays demonstrated that the mats allowed survival, attachment and proliferation of fibroblasts.

Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman is controlled with pesticides and alternative treatments in all these regions. To determine the concentration-mortality response lines of V. destructor, bioassays with four pesticides that are used for its control in the Gulf of Mexico, Yucatan Peninsula and Central-Highland regions were conducted. The Burgerjon spraying tower was used to apply known concentrations of flumethrin, fluvalinate, amitraz and coumaphos. Lethal concentrations 50 (LC50) and resistance indexes were calculated with Probit analyses. In the Gulf region, the resistance indexes were: flumethrin, 659.43; fluvalinate, 21.83; amitraz, 12.77; coumaphos, 1.49×. In the Central-Highland region: flumethrin, 243.43; fluvalinate, 19.04; amitraz, 8.56; coumaphos, 1.22 x.

Furthermore, differences in how experimental methods are executed can make it difficult to distinguish between effects of focal versus extraneous variables. Insect neural function is commonly evaluated using Pavlovian conditioning techniques; learning and memory in many species can be assessed using the proboscis extension reflex (PER). However, there are significant inconsistencies in methods used to immobilize insects prior to PER tests. We compared responses of honeybees immobilized in a refrigerator, on ice, and in a freezer, and evaluated influence of recovery interval before testing. Ice-chilling weakly decreased learning (response to an originally neutral odor) more so than refrigeration or freezing, but not 24-h recall of odor. We found no significant differences in responsiveness to sucrose relative to cooling method, but responsiveness was significantly lower among honeybees left to recover for only 0.75. h versus 1.5 or 3. h. Finally, we observed increased responsiveness to sucrose and geraniol between June and August.

In the honeybee Apis mellifera, nAChRs are expressed in diverse structures including the primary olfactory centers of the brain, the antennal lobes (ALs) and the mushroom bodies (MBs), where they participate in olfactory information processing. To understand the nature and properties of the nAChRs involved in these processes, we performed a pharmacological and molecular characterization of nAChRs on cultured Kenyon cells of the MBs, using whole cell patch-clamp recordings combined with single-cell RT-PCR. In all cells, applications of ACh as well as nicotinic agonists such as nicotine and imidacloprid induced inward currents with fast desensitization. These currents were fully blocked by saturating doses of the antagonists α-bungarotoxin (α-BGT), dihydroxy-β-erythroidine (DHE), and methyllycaconitine (MLA) (MLA ≥ α-BGT ≥DHE). Molecular analysis of ACh-responding cells revealed that of the 11 nicotinic receptor subunits encoded within the honeybee genome, α2, α8, and β 1 subunits were expressed in adult Kenyon cells. Comparison with the expression pattern of adult AL cells revealed the supplementary presence of subunit α7, which could be responsible for the kinetic and pharmacological differences observed when comparing ACh-induced currents from AL and Kenyon cells. Together, our data demonstrate the existence of functional nAChRs on adult MB Kenyon cells that differ from nAChRs on AL cells in both their molecular composition and pharmacological properties, suggesting that changing receptor subsets could mediate different processing functions depending on the brain structure within the olfactory pathway. © 2011 the American Physiological Society.","Antennal lobe cells; Kenyon cells; Patch clamp; Single-cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054031733

We utilized the honey bee model and a newly developed spatial avoidance conditioning assay to probe effects of biogenic amines octopamine (OA) and dopamine (DA) on avoidance learning. In this new protocol non-harnessed bees associate a spatial color cue with mild electric shock punishment. After a number of experiences with color and shock the bees no longer enter the compartment associated with punishment. Intrinsic aspects of avoidance conditioning are associated with natural behavior of bees such as punishment (lack of food, explosive pollination mechanisms, danger of predation, heat, etc.) and their association to floral traits or other spatial cues during foraging. The results show that DA reduces the punishment received whereas octopamine OA increases the punishment received. These effects are dose-dependent and specific to the acquisition phase of training. The effects during acquisition are specific as shown in experiments using the antagonists Pimozide and Mianserin for DA and OA receptors, respectively.

Gel-based and gel-free proteomics approaches and high-performance liquid chromatography-chip quadruple time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry were applied to comprehensively investigate the protein components of RJ. Overall, 37 and 22 nonredundant proteins were identified by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis and gel-free analysis, respectively, and 19 new proteins were found by these two proteomics approaches. Major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs) were identified as the principal protein components of RJ, and proteins related to carbohydrate metabolism such as glucose oxidase, α-glucosidase precursor, and glucose dehydrogenase were also successfully identified. Importantly, the 19 newly identified proteins were mainly classified into three functional categories: oxidation-reduction (ergic53 CG6822-PA isoform A isoform 1, Sec61 CG9539-PA, and ADP/ATP translocase), protein binding (regucalcin and translationally controlled tumor protein CG4800-PA isoform 1), and lipid transport (apolipophorin-III-like protein).

Workers display a marked change in physiology when they transition from in-nest tasks to foraging. Recent technological advances have made it possible to unravel the metabolic modifications associated with this transition. Previous studies have revealed extensive remodeling of brain, thorax, and hypopharyngeal gland biochemistry. However, data on changes in the abdomen is scarce. To narrow this gap we investigated the proteomic composition of abdominal tissue in the days typically preceding the onset of foraging in honeybee workers. In order to get a broader representation of possible protein dynamics, we used workers of two genotypes with differences in the age at which they initiate foraging. This approach was combined with RNA interference-mediated downregulation of an insulin/insulin-like signaling component that is central to foraging behavior, the insulin receptor substrate (irs), and with measurements of glucose and lipid levels. Our data provide new insight into the molecular underpinnings of phenotypic plasticity in the honeybee, invoke parallels with vertebrate metabolism, and support an integrated and irs-dependent association of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism with the transition from in-nest tasks to foraging. © 2011 Chan et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053277324

The present study addresses the question whether individual castes (queen, major and minor) of the weaver ant, Oecophylla smaragdina (Fabricius) differ in the organization of the chemosensory structures on the antenna, maxillary and labial palps. The sensory structures were studied by light and scanning electron microscopy. It was observed that the sensilla numbers differ among the three castes, whereas all the three castes possess similar types of chemosensilla. This variation may be a factor underlying the differential chemosensory ability of castes. As the number of sensilla differs among castes, it is likely that a differential development of castes in terms of the number of primary mother cells, which are precursors of chemosensory structures, causes the variation of sensilla numbers. This mechanism appears to be a common principle in the caste-specific sensory system development as the visual system of honey bee has also been shown to follow such a mechanism.","Ant; Antenna; Castes; Chemosensilla; Mouthparts",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80755171542

Although lethal for larvae, the disease normally has relatively low virulence at the colony level. A recent study showed that there is genetic variation for host susceptibility, but whether Ascosphaera apis strains differ in virulence is unknown. We exploited a recently modified in vitro rearing technique to infect honeybee larvae from three colonies with naturally mated queens under strictly controlled laboratory conditions, using four strains from two distinct A. apis clades. We found that both strain and colony of larval origin affected mortality rates. The strains from one clade caused 12-14% mortality while those from the other clade induced 71-92% mortality. Larvae from one colony showed significantly higher susceptibility to chalkbrood infection than larvae from the other two colonies, confirming the existence of genetic variation in susceptibility across colonies. Our results are consistent with antagonistic coevolution between a specialized fungal pathogen and its host, and suggest that beekeeping industries would benefit from more systematic monitoring of this chronic stress factor of their colonies. © 2011 Vojvodic et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053062016

Bee colonies were placed under the shade provided by straw, polypropylene screen (80% shading), and trees, and under direct solar radiation, in a completely randomized design, with six replications. Data concerning beehives weight and breeding and feeding areas were analyzed by using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Honey samples collected from beehives were submitted to chemical analyses, in order to determine hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), acidity, and diastase activities. It was observed that the artificial covers did not provide significant beneficial effects on the colonies development. Thermoregulation was impaired in the beehives kept under polypropylene screen and those directly exposed to the sun, in the dry season. The arboreal shading provided the faster development for the breeding area and the straw and arboreal shadings favored the maintenance of lower HMF levels in the honey.","Apis mellifera L.; Honey quality; Honeybee colonies; Thermal environment",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052736772

Until recently, Nosema apis had been regarded as the causative agent of the disease, that causes heavy economic losses in apicultures. Nosema ceranae is an emerging microsporidian parasite of European honeybees, A. mellifera, but its distribution is not well known. Previously, nosemosis in honeybees in Iran was attributed exclusively to N. apis. Methods: Six Nosema positive samples (determined from light microscopy of spores) of adult worker bees from one province of Iran (Savadkouh- Mazandaran, northern Iran) were tested to determine Nosema species using previously- developed PCR primers of the 16 S rRNA gene. As it is difficult to distinguish N. ceranae and N. apis morphologically, a PCR assay based on 16 S ribosomal RNA has been used to differentiate N. apis and N. ceranae. Results: Only N. ceranae was found in all samples, indicating that this species present in Iran apiaries. Conclusion: This is the first report of N. ceranae in colonies of A. mellifera in Iran. It seems that intensive surveys are needed to determine the distribution and prevalence of N. ceranae in different regions of Iran.","Honeybee; Nosema apis; Nosema ceranae; PCR",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052573892

Honeybee venom expresses its toxicity not only by allergic reactions but it also causes molecular toxicity by making alteration in enzymes and bio-molecules. To come out from these toxic effects, polyclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing albino mice. Antibody was partially purified by octanoic acid precipitation and by ammonium sulphate treatment. The presence of antibody in the antiserum was confirmed by immuno-double diffusion test. 40% of LD 50 of bee venom was incubated with 400, 800, and 1200 μg of purified antibody and this incubated mixture was injected into experimental mice. Parallel to this, one set of mice were injected with only 40% of LD 50 and another injected with only saline which was considered as the control. The venom injected group showed 89.69% decrease in serum protein content while free amino acid, uric acid, cholesterol, pyruvic acid, total lipid and glucose was increased by 112.5, 122.10,102.48,110.0, 125.0 and 107.22% respectively.

Traditional methods of volatile detection used by law enforcement agencies and rescue teams typically consist of reliance on canine olfaction. This concept of using dogs to detect specific substances is quite old. However, dogs have some limitations such as cost of training and time of conditioning. Thus, the possibility of using other organisms as biosensors including rats, dolphins, honeybees, and parasitic wasps for detecting explosives, narcotics and cadavers has been developed. Insects have several advantages unshared by mammals. Insects are sensitive, cheap to produce and can be conditioned with impressive speed for a specific chemical-detection task. Moreover, insects might be a preferred sensing method in scenarios that are deemed too dangerous to use mammalian. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the biosensors used in forensic sciences.","Apis mellifera; Biosensors; Explosives; Human remains; Indicator animals; Microplitis croceipes; Narcotics",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052606847

The evolution of this worker sterility has been plausibly explained by kin selection theory [Hamilton W (1964) J Theor Biol 7:1-52], and many traits have evolved to prevent conflict over reproduction among the females in an insect colony. In honeybees (Apis mellifera), worker reproduction is regulated by the queen, brood pheromones, and worker policing. However, workers of the Cape honeybee, Apis mellifera capensis, can evade this control and establish themselves as social parasites by activating their ovaries, parthenogenetically producing diploid female offspring (thelytoky) and producing queen-like amounts of queen pheromones. All these traits have been shown to be strongly influenced by a single locus on chromosome 13 [Lattorff HMG, et al. (2007) Biol Lett 3:292-295]. We screened this region for candidate genes and found that alternative splicing of a gene homologous to the gemini transcription factor of Drosophila controls worker sterility. Knocking out the critical exon in a series of RNAi experiments resulted in rapid worker ovary activation - one of the traits characteristic of the social parasites. This genetic switch may be controlled by a short intronic splice enhancer motif of nine nucleotides attached to the alternative splice site. The lack of this motif in parasitic Cape honeybee clones suggests that the removal of nine nucleotides from the altruistic worker genome may be sufficient to turn a honeybee from an altruistic worker into a parasite.","Caste determination; Cuticular protein 2-family; Gene expression",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053081882

But the unexplained death of more than one-third of honey bee colonies in North America during each of the past 3 years, termed colony collapse disorder, has endangered the continuous supply of honey bees as pollinators of flowering plants. Among the factors more frequently associated with these die-offs are the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor and the endoparasitic microsporidia Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae.

This article gives a description of studies conducted during the past several decades that have contributed to our knowledge of specific behavioral and immune-based defenses of honey bees to diseases and parasites. Despite recent advancements at the behavioral level, the study of the genetic basis of disease resistance at the molecular level is still in its infancy and remains poorly understood.

Although much research have been done to investigate the causes of honeybee caste polymorphism, information at subcellular protein levels is limited. We analyzed queen- and worker-destined larvae mitochondrial proteome at three early developmental stages using combinations of differential centrifugation, two-dimensional electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, bioinformatics, and quantitative real time PCR. In total, 67, 69, and 97 protein spots were reproducibly identified as mitochondrial proteins at 72, 96, and 120 h, respectively. There were significant qualitative and quantitative protein expression differences between the two castes at three developmental stages. In general, the queen-destined larvae up-regulated large proportions of proteins at all of the developmental stages and, in particular, 95% at 72 h. An overwhelming majority of the queen larvae up-regulated proteins were physiometabolic-enriched proteins (metabolism of carbohydrate and energy, amino acid, and fatty acid) and involved in protein folding, and this was further verified by functional enrichment and biological interaction network analyses as a direct link with metabolic rates and cellular responses to hormones. Although wide-ranging mitochondrial proteomes participate to shape the metabolic, physiologic, and anatomic differences between the two castes at 72 h, physiometabolic-enriched proteins were found as the major modulators of the profound marking of this caste differentiation. Owing to nutritional difference, prospective queen larvae showed enhanced growth, and this was manifested through the overexpression of metabolic enzymes. Differently from similar studies targeting the causes of honeybee caste polymorphism, this subcellular level study provides an in-depth insight into mitochondrial proteins-mediated caste polymorphism and greatly improves protein coverage involved during honeybee caste determination. Hence, it is a major step forward in the analysis of the fundamental causes of honeybee caste pathway decision and greatly contributes to the knowledge of honeybee biology. In particular, the consistency between the 22 proteins and mRNA expressions provides us important target genes for the reverse genetic analysis of caste pathway modulation through RNA interference. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","honeybee; mitochondria; pathways; polymorphism; proteome",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052439444

Wing images of honeybee subspecies, obtained from the Morphometric Bee Data Bank in Oberursel, Germany, were assigned to four honeybee lineages from the indivudial images, and 40 Cartesian coordinates were obtained. Honeybee lineages were significantly different based on individual and colony consensus average wing shapes of honeybee subspecies (P<0.001). According to the discriminant function analysis of honeybee lineages, the A lineage and M lineage showed some degree of overlap. Multivariate statistical analysis displayed that Apis mellifera intermissa, a member of M lineage, seemed to belong to the A lineage. In addition, Apis mellifera sicula, a member of C lineage; Apis mellifera sahariensis, a member of M lineage; and Apis mellifera syriaca, a member of O lineage, were located closer to the A lineage rather than to their own lineages. In the previous studies, the results of principal component analysis of morphometric data and the mtDNA analysis of honeybee subspecies supported these subspecific affinities. Thus, geometric morphometric analysis of wing shape could be used as a reliable tool to discriminate among honeybee subspecies and may have advantages over standard morphometry. © INRA, DIB-AGIB and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., 2011.","Apis mellifera; Discriminant function analysis; Geometric morphometric; Landmark; Subspecies",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054710475

Here, we test whether this reproductive division of labour is evident in both the socially parasitic workers that invade a colony as well as in their offspring generation. We infected six Apis mellifera scutellata host colonies with pseudo-clonal socially parasitic Cape honeybee workers (Apis mellifera capensis). We show that the first generation of socially parasitic workers can monopolize reproduction within host colonies. Of the initially invading parasites, 94.4% became reproductive pseudoqueens with activated ovaries and produced queen-like pheromones. Their offspring, however, had much lower levels of ovary activation (3.1%), yet 89% showed fatty acid synthesis typical of the queen substance (9-oxo-2(E)-decenoic acid) biochemical pathway. However, in these second-generation workers, the last oxidation step from the precursor (9-hydroxy-2(E)-decenoic acid) to the queen substance was interrupted and appears to be required for reproductive dominance in honeybee workers. Our data show that despite the absence of genetic diversity, residual queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) variation is sufficient to establish reproductive dominance hierarchies among parasitic workers. Consequently, QMP produced by a group of workers can maintain reproductive division of labour in queenless honeybee colonies. © INRA, DIB-AGIB and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., 2011.","Cape honeybees; Division of labour; Queen mandibular pheromone; Response thresholds; Self-organisation; Worker reproduction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054698431

The strain formed a branched substrate mycelium and mature aerial mycelium bore short chains of arthrospores with warty surfaces. The cell wall contained meso-2,6-diaminopimelic acid (cell-wall type III) and the whole cell sugars were fucose, galactose, glucose, madurose, mannose and ribose. The major isoprenoid quinone was hexahydrogenated menaquinone with nine isoprene units and the predominant cellular fatty acids were C 16: 0 (33.8%), C 18: 1ω9c (32.7%), summed feature 3 (C 16: 1ω7c and/or iso-C 15: 0 2-OH) (8.7%) and 10-methyl C 18: 0 (8.2%).

In comparison to Nosema apis, which has been infecting the honeybee for much longer, N. ceranae seems to have co-evolved less with this host, causing a more virulent disease. Given that N. apis and N. ceranae are obligate intracellular microsporidian parasites, needing host energy to reproduce, energetic stress may be an important factor contributing to the increased virulence observed. Through feeding experiments on caged bees, we show that both mortality and sugar syrup consumption were higher in N. ceranae-infected bees than in N. apis-infected and control bees. The mortality and sugar syrup consumption are also higher in N. apis-infected bees than in controls, but are less than in N. ceranae-infected bees. With both microsporidia, mortality and sugar syrup consumption increased in function of the increasing spore counts administered for infection. The differences in energetic requirements between both Nosema spp. confirm that their metabolic patterns are not the same, which may depend critically on host-parasite interactions and, ultimately, on host pathology. The repercussions of this increased energetic stress may even explain the changes in host behavior due to starvation, lack of thermoregulatory capacity, or higher rates of trophallaxis, which might enhance transmission and bee death. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052312454

The specific functions of serotonin are mediated by its binding to and subsequent activation of membrane receptors. The vast majority of these receptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. We report here the in vivo expression pattern of a recently characterized 5-HT 1 receptor of the honeybee Apis mellifera (Am5-HT 1A) in the mushroom bodies. In addition, we summarize current knowledge on the distribution of serotonin and serotonin receptor subtypes in the brain and specifically in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the honeybee. Functional studies in these two species have shown that serotonergic signaling participates in various behaviors including aggression, sleep, circadian rhythms, responses to visual stimuli, and associative learning. The molecular, pharmacological, and functional properties of identified 5-HT receptor subtypes from A. mellifera and D. melanogaster will also be summarized in this review. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Apis mellifera; Drosophila melanogaster; G-protein-coupled receptor; Mushroom body; Serotonin",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052903128

Bee colonies were provided six different pollen substitutes viz., full fat soy flour (FFSF), roasted full fat soy flour (RFFSF), germinated soybean flour (GSF), defatted soy flour (DFSF), roasted defatted soy flour (RDFSF), soy protein concentrate (SPC) and compared with the control (no feeding) to determine their impact on desirable attributes of bee colonies. Results indicated that the per cent palatability of all the diets were more than 60%. A gradual increase in brood area, honey store and pollen store were observed after feeding in all the diet combination, viz SPC, followed by GSF, DFSF, FFSF and RDFSF. All the desirable parameters were found to be least in RFFSF. However, all the diets were found significantly superior over control. Significant increase in the foraging activity of the bees was found to be in colonies fed with pollen substitute. Cost and shelf-life of these patties were also calculated, in support of the adoption of these patties.

Mating stimulates dramatic changes in queen behavior, physiology, gene expression, and pheromone production. Here, we used virgin, single drone- (SDI), and multi-drone- (MDI) inseminated queens to study the effects of instrumental insemination and insemination quantity on the pheromone profiles of the Dufour's gland, and the expression of the egg-yolk protein, vitellogenin, in the fat body. Age, environmental conditions, and genetic background of the queens were standardized to specifically characterize the effects of these treatments. Our data demonstrate that insemination and insemination quantity significantly affect the chemical profiles of the Dufour's gland secretion. Moreover, workers were more attracted to Dufour's gland extract from inseminated queens compared to virgins, and to the extract of MDI queens compared to extract of SDI queens. However, while there were differences in the amounts of some esters between MDI queens and the other groups, it appears that the differences in behavioral responses were elicited by subtle changes in the overall chemical profiles rather than dramatic changes in specific individual chemicals. We also found a decrease in vitellogenin gene expression in the fat body of the MDI queens, which is negatively correlated with the quantities of Dufour's gland content. The possible explanations of this reduction are discussed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Behavior; Chemical ecology; Gene expression; Pheromone; Social insects",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052821702

Myosin-Va is present in the honey bee Apis mellifera nervous system of the larvae and adult castes and subcastes. DYNLL1/LC8 and myosin-IIb, -VI and -IXb have also been detected in the adult brain. SNARE proteins, such as CaMKII, clathrin, syntaxin, SNAP25, munc18, synaptophysin and synaptotagmin, are also expressed in the honey bee brain. Honey bee myosin-Va displayed ATP-dependent solubility and was associated with DYNLL1/LC8 and SNARE proteins in the membrane vesicle-enriched fraction. Myosin-Va expression was also decreased after the intracerebral injection of melittin and NMDA. The immunolocalization of myosin-Va and -IV, DYNLL1/LC8, and synaptophysin in mushroom bodies, and optical and antennal lobes was compared with the brain morphology based on Neo-Timm histochemistry and revealed a distinct and punctate distribution. This result suggested that the pattern of localization is associated with neuron function.

This is potentially explained by the adaptive defensive strategies of host bees when faced with nest invaders exhibiting various levels of colony integration (based on adaptations to the nest habitat and frequency of nest inhabitation). In the present study, experiments are performed to determine the behaviour at the nest entrance of European honeybee guards Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) toward beetle invaders of various levels of behavioural integration into colonies. The species used to test this include Aethina tumida Murray (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), which is regarded as a highly integrated, unwelcome guest (synechthran) or true guest (symphile); Lobiopa insularis Laporte (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) and Epuraea luteola Erichson (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) that are accidentals; and Carpophilus humeralis Fabricius (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), Carpophilus hemipterus L. (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) and Tribolium castaneum Herbst (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), all of which are species that are not integrated into honeybee colonies. The responses of guard bees to a control bead also are noted. In general, bees ignore T. castaneum and E. luteola to a greater extent than other beetle species. Bees make contact with the black glass bead (a non-aggressive behaviour) more than they do all beetle species. Bees treat A. tumida more defensively than they treat any other beetle species and the level of bee defensiveness varies by colony. These data suggest an adaptive heightened defensive response by bees toward the most integrated colony intruder but a significantly reduced level of response toward invaders representing all other levels of colony integration. © 2011 University of Florida.

Forty-eight varroa-infested colonies were randomly distributed amongst six experimental groups (n = 8 colonies per group): one control group (G1); two groups tested applications of different dosages of a 40 g OA/l sugar solution 1:1 trickled on bees (G2 and G3); three groups tested different applications of FA: 35 ml of 65% FA in an absorbent Dri-Loc ® pad (G4); 35 ml of 65% FA poured directly on the hive bottom board (G5) and MiteAwayII™ (G6). The efficacy of treatments (varroa drop), colony development, honey yield and hive survival were monitored from May until September. Five honey bee queens died during this research, all of which were in the FA treated colonies (G4, G5 and G6). G6 colonies had significantly lower brood build-up during the beekeeping season. Brood populations at the end of summer were significantly higher in G2 colonies. Spring honey yield per colony was significantly lower in G6 and higher in G1. Summer honey flow was significantly lower in G6 and higher in G3 and G5. During the treatment period, there was an increase of mite drop in all the treated colonies. Varroa daily drop at the end of the beekeeping season (September) was significantly higher in G1 and significantly lower in G6. The average number of dead bees found in front of hives during treatment was significantly lower in G1, G2 and G3 versus G4, G5 and G6. Results suggest that varroa control is obtained from all spring treatment options. However, all groups treated with FA showed slower summer hive population build-up resulting in reduced honey flow and weaker hives at the end of summer. FA had an immediate toxic effect on bees that resulted in queen death in five colonies. The OA treatments that were tested have minimal toxic impacts on the honey bee colonies. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Apis mellifera; Formic acid; Oxalic acid; Spring treatments; Varroa destructor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79961021394

All bacterial 16S rRNA genes were sequenced and deposited in GenBank. The 34 isolated strains yielded three distinct rRNA sequences of 15 different strains. Lactobacillus sequences isolated from the bees' honey stomachs were comprised of Lactobacillus kunkeei related-sequences (56%) with other abundant sequences being related to other Lactobacillus sp. (38%) and Lactobacillus vermiform (6%). These strains can be good candidates for potential application as probiotics in honeybees and also as natural food preservatives, which, in turn, may be useful in the food industry. © INRA, DIB-AGIB and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., 2011.","Apis dorsata; Honey stomach; Lactobacillus bacteria; Probiotics",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054693082

These samples were analyzed by the cleaved amplified polymorphisms technique using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as a molecular marker in their COI-COII intergenic region (Cytochrome Oxidase I and II). Polymerase chain reaction amplicons (500-950 bp) were subjected to restriction analysis by DraI enzyme. The restriction profiles were analyzed and compared with the existing mtDNA markers on polyacrylamide gels. Sixteen new haplotypes were identified, 14 of them on the African lineage A, one new haplotype on the North Mediterranean lineage C and one other on the West Mediterranean lineage M. DNA sequences of all these haplotypes were subsequently determined. We also identified five other haplotypes that had been described in a previous study. These five haplotypes were renamed and grouped more appropriately with the subgroup Z, rather than with the Oriental lineage O. The sequence structures of these novel haplotypes clearly display the specific characteristics of the African branch (A). However, they differ from the African haplotypes by a new restriction site; therefore, they have been moved into a new subgroup.

African honeybee populations seem healthier and no major losses have been reported despite the presence of all the major pests and diseases. The scattered colonies in the large wild population of the continent might ensure slow pathogen spread and thus protect the unmanaged colonies in comparison with the concentration of colonies in managed apiaries. Beekeeping and trade in bee products is responsible for spreading many diseases throughout the world. The recent outbreak of the bacterial disease American foulbrood (AFB) in South Africa is a matter of great concern. Despite a growing number of apiaries testing positive for AFB, no major colony losses have been reported yet. This could be based on higher disease resistance of African honeybees, but such a trait might not persist if pathogens accumulate in the hives. In the first part of this article we review what is known on the history, biology and epidemiology of AFB as well as the control methods available. We then argue that given the particular context of honeybees in Africa, protection policies need to be put in place to ensure that African honeybees remain healthy.","AFB; Apis mellifera scutellata; brood disease; Paenibacillus larvae; South Africa",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81255136455

However, worker division of labor and reproductive competition under queenless conditions are influenced by worker ovary size. Little comparative information on ovary size exists in the different honey bee species. Here, we report ovariole numbers of freshly dissected workers from six Apis species from two locations in Southeast Asia. The average number of worker ovarioles differs significantly among species. It is strongly correlated with the average mating number of queens, irrespective of body size. Apis dorsata, in particular, is characterized by numerous matings and very large worker ovaries. The relation between queen mating number and ovary size across the six species suggests that individual selection via reproductive competition plays a role in worker ovary size evolution. This indicates that genetic diversity, generated by multiple mating, may bear a fitness cost at the colony level. © Springer-Verlag 2011.","Caste divergence; Levels of selection; Ovarioles; Reproductive conflict; Social evolution; Worker reproduction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80055025103

Within a colony, division of labor, the performance of tasks by different individuals, follows genetically determined physiological changes that go along with aging. Modern advances in tools of molecular biology and genomics, as well as the sequentiation of A. mellifera genome, have enabled a better understanding of honeybee behaviour, in particular social behaviour. Numerous studies show that aspects of worker behaviour are genetically determined, including defensive, hygienic, reproductive and foraging behaviour. For example, genetic diversity is associated with specialization to collect water, nectar and pollen. Also, control of worker reproduction is associated with genetic differences.

Hence, the discovery of new approaches for the design of novel vaccines and antiviral compounds attains high attention. Here we describe the potential of artificial ribonucleases (aRNases), low molecular weight compounds capable to cleave phosphodiester bonds in RNA under mild conditions, to act as antiviral compounds via destroying the genome of non-enveloped RNA viruses, and the potential of utilizing honey bee larvae and adult bees (Apis mellifera) as a novel experimental system for the screening of new antiviral compounds. Pre-incubation of an Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) suspension with aRNases D3-12, K-D-1 or Dp12F6 in a concentration-dependent manner increased the survival rate of bee larvae and adult bees subsequently infected with these preparations, whereas incubation of the virus with aRNases ABL3C3 or L2-3 had no effect at all. The results of RT-PCR analysis of viral RNA isolated from aRNase-treated virus particles confirmed that virus inactivation occurs via degradation of viral genomic RNA: dose-dependent inactivation of ABPV correlates well with the cleavage of viral RNA. Electron microscopy analysis revealed that the morphology of ABPV particles inactivated by aRNases remains unaffected as compared to control virus preparations. Altogether the obtained results clearly demonstrate the potential of aRNases as a new virus inactivation agents and bee larvae/ABPV as a new in vivo system for the screening of antiviral compounds. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Acute bee paralysis virus; Antiviral activity; Artificial ribonucleases; Bee larvae; Killed-virus vaccine; Virus inactivation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960471647

Using traditional estimates of effectiveness (visitation rate and seed set), our results show that hummingbirds were the most effective pollinators as expected. Bees and ants were less effective, and their contributions were one-fourth to one-tenth of that observed for hummingbirds. We then modified this measure of effectiveness by adding two components, fitness of progeny and temporal availability of visitors, both of which refine estimates of flower visitor effectiveness. With these new estimations, we found that the effectiveness values of all three animal visitors decreased; however, the role of hummingbirds as the principal pollinator was maintained, whereas the effectiveness values of bees and ants approached zero.

Observations were made on 40 inflorescences per treatment. The treatments included unlimited floral access by all visitors, bagged flowers to deny all visits, and limited visits by X. calens only. In addition, all flower visitors were recorded. The carpenter bee's seasonal rhythm of activity, its foraging behavior on flowers, its pollination efficiency, the fructification rate and the number of seeds per pod were recorded. Individuals from 16 species of insects were recorded visiting flowers of P. coccineus in the 2 years. Xylocopa calens was the most frequent, followed by Chalicodoma cincta cincta and Apis mellifera. Apart from bees, wasps were also recorded as likely predators. Xylocopa calens mainly foraged for nectar resources. The mean foraging speed was 9.62 flowers/min. Flowers visited by X. calens had higher fruiting rate compared with others, while those bagged had the lowest. In addition, seed formation was higher in X. calens-visited flowers compared with all others. The results show that this crop experiences pollination deficit even under normal circumstances, considering that flowers visited by X. calens had higher yields compared with those under unlimited access by all visitors. The fruiting rate, the number of seeds/pod and the percentage of normal seeds of unprotected inflorescences were significantly higher than those of inflorescences protected from insects. X. calens foraging resulted in a significant increment of the fruiting rate by 25.80%, as well as the number of seeds/pod by 14.97% and the percentage of normal seeds by 27.75% in 2008 and 18.39% in 2009.

It has, however, been notoriously difficult to find conclusive empirical support for these predictions. We performed a comprehensive test of the energy budget rule in the honeybee, Apis mellifera, by constructing empirical utility functions and by testing the choice of bees for a constant or variable reward with an olfactory conditioning assay subsequent to manipulating their energy budgets. We demonstrate that a decline in energetic state leads to an increasing choice for a variable reward, while an increase in energetic state leads to an increased choice for a constant reward. We then show that subjects maintained on constant high or low energy budgets are risk indifferent, which suggests that an animal must perceive a change in its energetic state to be risk sensitive. We discuss the challenges of finding empirical evidence for the energy budget rule and the necessity of integrating physiological assays in these tests. Based on our previous results showing that parasitic infections cause an energetic stress in honeybees, we also discuss the possibility of energetic shortfall being responsible for the observed display of risky behaviour in infected bees. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Choice behaviour; Decision making; Energy budget rule; Honeybee; Nosema; Optimal foraging; Proboscis extension conditioning; Risk sensitivity; Utility function; Variability",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051666356

The detection of negative strand RNA of BQCV, an indicator of active virus replication, in the gut of B. huntii suggests that virus particles replicate within the gut and then cross the gut lining to other tissues through hemolymph circulation. The observation of active replication of the BQCVin the gut, together with the fact that BQCV was more widespread in the body offield-collected bees than that of lab-reared bees, implies a possible association between the foraging activities of bumble bees and virus transmission. The fact that bumble bees and honey bees are able to share nectar and pollen resources in the same field suggests that geographical proximity of two host species could play a role in host range breadth of BQCV. © INRA, DIB-AGIB and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., 2011.","Black Queen Cell Virus; Bombus huntii; Bumble bee; Host range",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054709067

Pollinator preferences may exert direct selection on floral color; however, floral color might also be the indirect target of selection through genetic associations with other traits under selection. Malva moschata (Malvaceae) is a North American species that produces either red or white flowers. In the present study, we present reflectance spectrophotometry data that characterize the nature of floral color variation in this species and show that honey bees and bumble bees should be able to distinguish between the morphs through differential sensitivity at the green (long-wavelength) photoreceptor. Second, we use a series of phenotypic measures to investigate whether the color morphs differ with respect to other floral traits, vegetative traits or female reproductive success, and use a series of correlation analyses to infer the relative independence of color from these other traits. We found that red-flowered morphs produced more anthers per flower and had greater leaf area, and that white-flowered morphs had greater percentage fruit set; however, there were no reproductive success differences between the morphs. The relationship between flower size and anther number was the only correlation that differed between the morphs. Finally, a series of pollinator-choice experiments showed that bumble bees strongly prefer red morphs in terms of visit frequency and duration, but honey bees have no preference. Taken together, our results suggest that color is rather independent of other phenotypic traits, and that honey bee abundance is likely to play a role in maintaining color variation in this system. © 2011 The Authors.

Specifically, 63-83% use at least one type of alternative medicine and 25-63% use herbals and vitamins. Propolis is a naturopathic honeybee product, and CAPE (caffeic acid phenethyl ester), is a major medicinal component of propolis. CAPE, in a concentration dependent fashion, inhibits MCF-7 (hormone receptor positive, HR+) and MDA-231 (a model of triple negative BC (TNBC) tumor growth, both in vitro and in vivo without much effect on normal mammary cells and strongly influences gene and protein expression. It induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and reduces expression of growth and transcription factors, including NF-κB. Notably, CAPE down-regulates mdr-1 gene, considered responsible for the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Further, CAPE dose-dependently suppresses VEGF formation by MDA-231 cells and formation of capillary-like tubes by endothelial cells, implicating inhibitory effects on angiogenesis. In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that CAPE inhibits MDA-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer growth via its apoptotic effects, and modulation of NF-κB, the cell cycle, and angiogenesis. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Angiogenesis; Apoptosis; Breast cancer; CAPE; Cell cycle",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958157538

Honeybees are a good model for revealing these mechanisms because they display various social behaviors, such as division of labor, in their colonies. Image processing is a precise and convenient tool for obtaining animal behavior data, but even recent methods are inadequate for the identification or description of honeybee behavior. This is because of the difficulty distinguishing between the large number of individuals in a small hive and their multiple movements. The present study developed a new computer-aided system, using a vector quantization method, for the identification and behavioral tracking of individual honeybees. The vector quantization method enabled separation of honeybee bodies in photographs recorded as a movie. This system succeeded in analyzing a huge number of frames quickly and can thus save both time and labor. Moreover, the system identified more than 72% of the bees in a hive and found and determined the active areas in the hive by extracting the trajectories of walking bees. In addition, useful behavioral data on the honeybee waggle dance were obtained using the present system. © INRA, DIB-AGIB and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., 2011.","Apis mellifera; Behavioral tracking; Honeybee; Image processing",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054706539

Although diagnostic methods for CSBV have been established in many clinical laboratories, application of these methods is largely restricted by the apparatus needed to carry out the reaction and by cost, therefore a simpler and less expensive diagnostic method for CSBV infection is required. In this study a simple and inexpensive system is described that is based on the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. The LAMP and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods were compared for their ability to detect CSBV in 31 clinical samples, in purified CSBV-LNQY strains or to be able to discriminate between cDNA samples from other viruses. The detection limit of the LAMP method was 1. pg, showing that LAMP is as sensitive as reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR for CSBV detection. In addition, no DNA band from other related viruses samples was amplified by either method, suggesting that this LAMP assay is as specific as RT-PCR for CSBV detection. All 31 clinical samples that were LAMP assay-positive were also amplified by RT-PCR, however the LAMP assay was faster, more cost effective, and easier to perform as the target gene amplified rapidly, within 2. h, and only a standard laboratory water bath or heat block was required for the reaction. The results demonstrate clearly that this LAMP-based assay is a useful tool for the rapid and sensitive diagnosis of CSBV infection of bees. © 2011.","Chinese sacbrood virus; Loop-mediated isothermal amplification; Sensitivity; Specificity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960576723

The risks of relying on a single species are obvious. Other species have been developed for particular crops. Here we present an extension of the framework of Bosch and Kemp (2002) that deals on how to develop a bee species into a crop pollinator. We used nesting aids in different settings to address five important issues that are necessary for an effective management of a bee species in a commercial setting. Our study system was the red mason bee (Osmia bicornis) in apple orchards in eastern Germany, but our approach should be transferable to other settings. The first issue was to demonstrate that it is possible to increase population size of O. bicornis by providing nesting aids. Second, we present how someone can study landscape features that promote the occurrence and abundance of O. bicornis. Further, we studied the dispersal of the species inside the orchard, and could demonstrate that bees prefer to disperse along lines of trees. Finally, we studied the effect of nesting substrate and type of farming on the recruitment of bees. We found a close relationship between the length of nesting tubes and achieved sex ratio and a negative effect of conventional farming on the number of nests built. We conclude with recommendations on how our findings can be used to optimize the management of O. bicornis in apple orchards. © INRA, DIB-AGIB and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., 2011.","Apoidea; Management; Pollination; Solitary bees; Yield increase",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054704310

Here, we present evidence that the serine protease found in bumblebee venom exhibits fibrin(ogen)olytic activity. Compared to honeybee venom, bumblebee venom contains a higher content of serine protease, which is one of its major components. Venom serine proteases from bumblebees did not cross-react with antibodies against the honeybee venom serine protease. We provide functional evidence indicating that bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) venom serine protease (Bt-VSP) acts as a fibrin(ogen)olytic enzyme. Bt-VSP activates prothrombin and directly degrades fibrinogen into fibrin degradation products. However, Bt-VSP is not a plasminogen activator, and its fibrinolytic activity is less than that of plasmin. Taken together, our results define roles for Bt-VSP as a prothrombin activator, a thrombin-like protease, and a plasmin-like protease. These findings offer significant insight into the allergic reaction sequence that is initiated by bee venom serine protease and its potential usefulness as a clinical agent in the field of hemostasis and thrombosis. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Bumblebee; Fibrin(ogen)olytic enzyme; Honeybee; Serine protease; Venom",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051582996

The focus was on the establishment method (undersowing or seed mixture sown post-tillage), seed mixture (competitive Festuca pratensis-Phleum pratense-Trifolium pratense or less competitive Agrostis capillaris-Festuca ovina mixture) and duration (1 or 2 years) of the fallow. The seed mixture and duration affected the pollinators more than the method of establishment. Pollinator species richness was higher in fallows sown with less competitive than with competitive grasses and it increased in the second year. Stubble fields reached as high pollinator species richness already during the first year as fallows with less competitive grasses did in the second year. Pollinator abundance was highest in those treatments in which species richness of flowering plants was highest. The results suggest that the benefits of rotational fallows for pollinators increase when they are established as stubble or using seeds of less competitive grasses and when the field is fallowed for (at least) two summers. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Bumblebee; Butterfly; Day-active moth; Farmland biodiversity; Honey bee; Set-aside experiment",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052783774

A comparable increase in neuropil volume results from treatment of worker honey bees with pilocarpine, an agonist for muscarinic-type cholinergic receptors. A component of the neuropil growth induced by foraging experience is growth of dendrites in the collar region of the calyces. We show here, via analysis of Golgi-impregnated collar Kenyon cells with wedge arborizations, that significant increases in standard measures of dendritic complexity were also found in worker honey bees treated with pilocarpine. This result suggests that signaling via muscarinic-type receptors promotes the increase in Kenyon cell dendritic complexity associated with foraging. Treatment of worker honey bees with scopolamine, a muscarinic inhibitor, inhibited some aspects of dendritic growth.

The honey bee developmental programme includes both larval components that determine plastic growth responses to larval nutrition and nurse components that regulate larval nutrition. We studied how these two components contribute to variation in worker and queen body size and ovary size for two pairs of honey bee lineages that show similar differences in worker body-ovary size allometry but have diverged over different evolutionary timescales. Our results indicate that the lineages have diverged for both nurse and larval developmental components, that rapid changes in worker body-ovary size allometry may disrupt queen development and that queen-worker dimorphism arises mainly from discrete nurse-provided nutritional environments, not from a developmental switch that converts variable nutritional environments into discrete phenotypes.

As its principal unsaturated fatty acid, RJ contains 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10-HDA), which may have antitumor and antibacterial activity and a capacity to stimulate collagen production. RJ has attracted interest in various parts of the world for its pharmacological properties. However, the effects of RJ on ultraviolet (UV)-induced photoaging of the skin have not been reported. In this study we measured the 10-HDA content of RJ by high-performance liquid chromatography and tested the effects of RJ on UVB-induced skin photoaging in normal human dermal fibroblasts. The effects of RJ and 10-HDA on UVB-induced photoaging were tested by measuring procollagen type I, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 after UVB irradiation. The RJ contained about 0.211% 10-HDA. The UVB-irradiated human skin fibroblasts treated with RJ and 10-HDA had increased procollagen type I and TGF-β1 productions, but the level of MMP-1 was not changed.

High levels of the Hex110 transcript were expressed in both worker and queen larvae. Low levels of this transcript were also detected in adult fat bodies, and the expression level was higher in the queen than in the worker. Bisulfite sequencing revealed that the Hex110 gene is overall methylated at a low level, with a limited number of CpG sites methylated at relatively high levels. These highly methylated sites were exclusively located in the exon regions. The average methylation rate of the Hex110 gene was higher in the adult stage than in the larval stage. Furthermore, several CpG sites were differentially methylated between the worker and queen larvae.

The aim of this study is to obtain a global view of the presence of environmental contaminants in beehives and, develop a fast, cheap and sensitive tool to analyze environmental contaminants in apiarian matrices. A multi residue analysis was developed to quantify 80 environmental contaminants, pesticides and veterinary drugs, belonging to different chemical classes, in honeys, honeybees and pollens. It consists in a single extraction, based on a modified "" QuEChERS method"" , followed by gas chromatography coupled with Time of Flight mass spectrometry (GC-ToF) and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The "" QuEChERS method"" combines salting-out liquid-liquid extraction with acetonitrile and a dispersive-SPE clean up. It was adjusted to honey and especially to honeybee and pollen, by adding a small fraction of hexane in acetonitrile to eliminate lipids that interfere with mass spectrometry analysis. This method, combined with accurate and sensitive detection, allowed quantification and confirmation at levels as low as 10. ng/g, with recoveries between 60 and 120%.

E. vulgare belongs to medicinal, ornamental and bee plants, since it is a source of nectar and pollen forage. These flowers are frequently visited by bumblebees and honey bees. Flowering specimens of common viper's bugloss were collected in the area of Lublin. Flowers and their parts were observed using stereoscopic microscopy. The micromorphology of the nectary at the initial stage of nectar secretion was observed in a scanning electron microscope. The rate of nectar production and pollen yield of the plants were determined as well as insects visiting flowers of this species were identified. The nectary, located at the base of the ovary, was found to be fused with its lower part. Nectar is secreted through numerous stomata located in the epidermis of the nectary. Nectar secretion, which starts at the bud stage, lasts throughout the flower life (3-4 days). Over this period, one flower of common viper's bugloss produces 2.14 mg of nectar with high sugar concentration (48%). Sugar yield of its flowers is on average 9.8 mg/10 flowers. The flowers start to shed pollen at bud break and release the largest amount of pollen during late morning hours. The weight of pollen produced by 10 flowers is 5.4 mg. The present study shows that the flowers of E. vulgare are a very good source of nectar and pollen forage.","Echium vulgare; Morphology; Nectar secretion; Nectary; Pollen yield",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051862395

We present here an analysis of features of its gene content and genome organization in comparison with Apis mellifera to assess the variation within the genus Apis and among main groups of Hymenoptera. The size of the entire mt genome of A. cerana is 15,895 bp, containing 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes and one control region. These genes are transcribed from both strands and have a nucleotide composition high in A and T. The contents of A+T of the complete genomes are 83.96% for A. cerana. The AT bias had a significant effect on both the codon usage pattern and amino acid composition of proteins. There are a total of 3672 codons in all 13 protein-coding genes, excluding termination codons. The most frequently used amino acid is Leu (15.52%), followed by Ile (12.85%), Phe (10.10%), Ser (9.15%) and Met (8.96%). Intergenic regions in the mt genome of A. cerana are 705 bp in total. The order and orientation of the gene arrangement pattern is identical to that of A. mellifera, except for the position of the tRNA-Ser (AGN) gene. Phylogenetic analyses using concatenated amino acid sequences of 13 protein-coding genes, with three different computational algorithms (NJ, MP and ML), all revealed two distinct groups with high statistical support, indicating that A. cerana and A. mellifera are two separate species, consistent with results of previous morphological and molecular studies. The complete mtDNA sequence of A. cerana provides additional genetic markers for studying population genetics, systematics and phylogeographics of honeybees. © 2011 Tan et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051653324

Orthodenticle genes have conserved roles, often with hunchback, in maternal anterior patterning in several insect species. We show that two orthodenticle genes, otd1 and otd2, and hunchback act as maternal anterior patterning genes in the honeybee (Apis mellifera) but, unlike other insects, act to pattern the majority of the anteroposterior axis. These genes regulate the expression domains of anterior, central and posterior gap genes and may directly regulate the anterior gap gene giant. We show otd1 and hunchback also influence dorsoventral patterning by regulating zerknült (zen) as they do in Tribolium, but that zen does not regulate the expression of honeybee gap genes. This suggests that interactions between anteroposterior and dorsalventral patterning are ancestral in holometabolous insects. Honeybee axis formation, and the function of the conserved anterior patterning gene orthodenticle, displays unique characters that indicate that, even when conserved genes pattern the axis, their regulatory interactions differ within orders of insects, consistent with relatively fast evolution in axis formation pathways. © 2011.

Vision in honeybees has been extensively studied at the behavioral level and, to a lesser degree, at the physiological level using intracellular electrophysiological recordings of single neurons. However, our knowledge of visual processing in honeybees is still limited by the lack of functional studies of visual processing at the circuit level. Here we contribute to filling this gap by providing a neuroanatomical and neurophysiological characterization at the circuit level of a practically unstudied visual area of the bee brain, the anterior optic tubercle (AOTu). First, we analyzed the internal organization and neuronal connections of the AOTu. Second, we established a novel protocol for performing optophysiological recordings of visual circuit activity in the honeybee brain and studied the responses of AOTu interneurons during stimulation of distinct eye regions. Our neuroanatomical data show an intricate compartmentalization and connectivity of the AOTu, revealing a dorsoventral segregation of the visual input to the AOTu. Light stimuli presented in different parts of the visual field (dorsal, lateral, or ventral) induce distinct patterns of activation in AOTu output interneurons, retaining to some extent the dorsoventral input segregation revealed by our neuroanatomical data. In particular, activity patterns evoked by dorsal and ventral eye stimulation are clearly segregated into distinct AOTu subunits. Our results therefore suggest an involvement of the AOTu in the processing of dorsoventrally segregated visual information in the honeybee brain. © 2011 the authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051562785

In this paper we analyze the statistics of visually captured high-precision dance trajectories of European honeybees (Apis mellifera carnica). The trajectories were produced using a novel automatic tracking system and represent the most detailed honeybee dance motion information available. Although honeybee dances seem very variable, some properties turned out to be invariant. We use these properties as a minimal set of parameters that enables us to model the honeybee dance motion.

Using a proteomic approach, we have investigated the expression of OBPs and CSPs in the mandibular glands of adult honey bees in relation to caste and age. OBP13 is mostly expressed in young individuals and in virgin queens, while OBP21 is abundant in older bees and is prevalent in mated queens. OBP14, which had been found in larvae, is produced in hive workers' glands. Quite unexpectedly, the mandibular glands of drones also contain OBPs, mainly OBP18 and OBP21. We have expressed three of the most represented OBPs and studied their binding properties. OBP13 binds with good specificity oleic acid and some structurally related compounds, OBP14 is better tuned to monoterpenoid structures, while OBP21 binds the main components of queen mandibular pheromone as well as farnesol, a compound used as a trail pheromone in the honey bee and other hymenopterans.

Cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification contributes to pyrethroid tolerance in many insects, but specific P450s responsible for pesticide detoxification in honey bees (indeed, in any hymenopteran pollinator) have not been defined. We expressed and assayed CYP3 clan midgut P450s and demonstrated that CYP9Q1, CYP9Q2, and CYP9Q3 metabolize tau-fluvalinate to a form suitable for further cleavage by the carboxylesterases that also contribute to tau-fluvalinate tolerance. These in vitro assays indicated that all of the three CYP9Q enzymes also detoxify coumaphos. Molecular models demonstrate that coumaphos and tau-fluvalinate fit into the same catalytic pocket, providing a possible explanation for the synergism observed between these two compounds. Induction of CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3 transcripts by honey extracts suggested that diet-derived phytochemicals may be natural substrates and heterologous expression of CYP9Q3 confirmed activity against quercetin, a flavonoid ubiquitous in honey. Up-regulation by honey constituents suggests that diet may influence the ability of honey bees to detoxify pesticides. Quantitative RT-PCR assays demonstrated that tau-fluvalinate enhances CYP9Q3 transcripts, whereas the pyrethroid bifenthrin enhances CYP9Q1 and CYP9Q2 transcripts and represses CYP9Q3 transcripts. The independent regulation of these P450s can be useful for monitoring and differentiating between pesticide exposures in-hive and in agricultural fields.","Apidae; Miticide; Transcriptional regulation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79961228944

The aim of this study was to evaluate the biological parameters associated with the interaction Apis mellifera x Baccharis dracunculifolia, to elucidate the supply of resin for green propolis production in Minas Gerais. We selected male and female individuals of two populations of Baccharis dracunculifolia located on São Judas Tadeu Farm - FSJT, in the municipality of Betim, MG and the Experimental Garden of the Ezequiel Dias Foundation - HORTO, located in an urban area in Belo Horizonte, MG. We made weekly observations, from June 2007 to June 2008, and evaluated in both populations: richness and abundance of insect visitors; resin collecting visits of Apis mellifera; presence of Baccharopelma dracunculifoliae galls; growth of individuals and phenological phases. Statistical analyses were made using R software. The rainy season showed the highest number of visitors. A. mellifera collected resin in shoot apices of Baccharis dracunculifolia from August to April, only in the FSJT population, where galls of B. dracunculifoliae were also present. Ovoposition of gall inductor on host plants occurs during the rainy season, when there is a peak of visitants and resin collecting visits of honeybees. This fact stimulates plant defense strategies against parasitoids and predators, which includes the production of several secondary metabolites, and ultimately reduces competition for food by inhibiting the attack of other phytophagous insects, not adapted to the chemical environment of plant tissues. Green propolis production in Minas Gerais is related to the abundant supply of resin by Baccharis dracunculifolia, when they are parasitised by B. dracunculifoliae galls. They induce plant production of defense exudates, which attract Apis mellifera bees to collect resin and consequently favour the production of green propolis.","Apis mellifera; Baccharis dracunculifolia; Baccharopelma dracunculifoliae; Galls; Green propolis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052590391

Performance of each species was determined by comparing single-visit pollen deposition, percentage of visits that contacted the stigma, flower-handling time, fruit and seed set, and fruit weight per number of visits. Fruit yield from small fields (0.6 ha) supplemented with commercial B. impatiens colonies was compared with yield from those not supplemented. A. mellifera spent nearly 2 and 3 times longer foraging on each pistillate flower compared with B. impatiens and P. pruinosa, respectively. A. mellifera also visited pistillate flowers 10-20 times more frequently than B. impatiens and P. pruinosa, respectively. Yet, B. impatiens deposited 3 times more pollen grains per stigma and contacted stigmas significantly more often than either A. mellifera or P. pruinosa. Fruit set and weight from flowers visited four to eight times by B. impatiens were similar to those from open-pollinated flowers, whereas flowers pollinated by A. mellifera and P. pruinosa produced fewer fruit and smaller fruit compared with those from open-pollinated flowers. Fields supplemented with B. impatiens produced significantly more pumpkins per plant than nonsupplemented fields. B. impatiens was a better pollinator of pumpkin than P. pruinosa and should be considered as a promising alternative to A. mellifera for pollinating this crop. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.","common eastern bumble bee; European honey bee; foraging behavior; P. pruinosa; pumpkin",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051752958

These are most expressively denoted in ovary size, with adult queens having large ovaries consisting of 150-200 ovarioles each, while workers typically have only 1-20 ovarioles per ovary. This morphological differentiation is a result of hormonal signals triggered by the diet change in the third larval instar, which eventually generate caste-specific gene expression patterns. To reveal these we produced differential gene expression libraries by Representational Difference Analysis (RDA) for queen and worker ovaries in a developmental stage when cell death is a prominent feature in the ovarioles of workers, whereas all ovarioles are maintained and extend in length in queens. In the queen library, 48% of the gene set represented homologs of known Drosophila genes, whereas in the worker ovary, the largest set (59%) were ESTs evidencing novel genes, not even computationally predicted in the honey bee genome. Differential expression was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR for a selected gene set, denoting major differences for two queen and two worker library genes. These included two unpredicted genes located in chromosome 11 (Group11.35 and Group11.31, respectively) possibly representing long non-coding RNAs. Being candidates as modulators of ovary development, their expression and functional analysis should be a focal point for future studies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Caste development; Cell death; Differential gene expression; Ovary development; Suppression subtractive hybridization",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959513976

We used a green fluorescent protein-expressing baculovirus with wild-type envelope and two pseudotype viruses of which one overexpressed GP64 and the other expressed a virion protein of a honeybee virus on the envelope. After injection of these baculoviruses into queen pupae, infection was detected in the fat bodies, but not in the ovaries. Pupae injected with a titer of 1×10 5 infectious units survived to eclose, and the infection was also detected in the fat bodies of adult queen honeybees, suggesting that baculoviruses can transiently express genes in the fat bodies, and therefore, can be used for further analysis of gene functions. In addition, although the viruses examined in this study failed to express the reporter gene in the ovaries, the infection in the fat bodies suggests that baculoviruses could be potentially useful for transgenesis, if appropriately developed. © INRA, DIB-AGIB and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., 2011.","Gene transfer; Honeybee; Pseudotype; Transgenesis; Virus vector",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054710832

The experiment was carried out using apitoxin extractors of a Canadian type which function by electro-stimulation. Three hives were used for each treatment and different extraction frequencies were evaluated: every 20 days (T1) and every 30 days (T2). The variables analysed were: effect on the weight of the colonies, bee mortality and quantity of apitoxin extracted. No significant differences were found between the variables studied (weight colonies p = 0.127, bee mortality p = 0.827, and amount of bee venom p = 0.507)and it was therefore concluded that its is recommended to carry out extractions every 30 days rather than every 20 days, since it is preferable to do this operation at longer time intervals in order to reduce operation costs and disturbance of the bees.","Extractors; Venom",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82055180600

In this study, we identified and characterized two novel β subunit genes (Accβ1 and Accβ2) from Apis cerana cerana. Homology analysis indicated that Accβ1 and Accβ2 possess characteristics that are typical of nAChR subunits although Accβ2 was distinct from Accβ1 and the other nAChR subunits, due to its unusual transmembrane structure and uncommon exon-intron boundary within the genomic region encoding the TM1 transmembrane domain. Analysis of the 5' flanking regions indicated that Accβ1 and Accβ2 possess different regulatory elements, suggesting that the genes might exhibit various expression and regulatory patterns. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that Accβ2 was expressed at a much higher level than Accβ1 in the tissues of adult bees. During development, Accβ1 was highly expressed at the pupal stages, whereas Accβ2 was abundantly expressed at the larval stages. Furthermore, Accβ1 and Accβ2 were both induced by exposure to various insecticides and environmental stresses although Accβ2 was more responsive than Accβ1. These results indicate that Accβ1 and Accβ2 may have distinct roles in insect growth and development and that they may belong to separate regulatory pathways involved in the response to insecticides and environmental stresses. This report is the first description of the differences between the nAChR β subunit genes in the Chinese honey bee and establishes an initial foundation for further study. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Apis cerana cerana; Insecticide; Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor β subunit; Promoter; Semi-quantitative RT-PCR",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960439717

A strong attention has been paid towards the phenomenon named Colony Collapse Disorder in which colonies suddenly disappear with no clear explanations. Honeybee colonies can be affected by abiotic factors, such as environmental pollution or insecticide applications for agricultural purposes. Also biotic stresses cause colony losses, including bacterial (e.g. Paenibacillus larvae) and fungal (e.g. Ascosphaera apis) pathogens, microsporidia (e.g. Nosema apis), parasites (i.e. Varroa destructor) and several viruses. In the light of recent research, intestinal dysbiosis, considered as the relative disproportion of the species within the native microbiota, has shown to affect human and animal health. In arthropods, alteration of the gut microbial climax community has been shown to be linked to health and fitness disequilibrium, like in the medfly Ceratitis capitata for which low mate competitiveness is determined by a gut microbial community imbalance. According to these observations, it is possible to hypothesize that dysbiosis may have a role in disease occurrence also in honeybees. Here we aim to discuss the current knowledge on dysbiosis in the honeybee and its relation with honeybee health by reviewing the investigations of the microbial diversity associated to honeybees and the recent experiments performed to control bee diseases by microbial symbionts. We conclude that, despite the importance of a good functionality of the associated microbiota in preserving insect health has been proved, the mechanisms involved in honeybee gut dysbiosis are still unknown. Accurate in vitro, in vivo and in field investigations are required under healthy, diseased and stressed conditions for the host. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag, GmbH.","Biological control; Gut homeostasis; Microbial climax community; Symbiosis",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960116597

(Hymenoptera: Apidae), has recently become a model for studying brain asymmetry among invertebrates. A strong lateralization favouring the right antenna was discovered in odour learning and short-term memory recall experiments, and a lateral shift favouring the left antenna for long-term memory recall. Corresponding morphological asymmetries have been found in the distribution of olfactory sensilla between the antennae and confirmed by electrophysiological odour response measurements in isolated right and left antennae. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a morphological asymmetry can be observed in the volume of the primary olfactory centres of the central nervous system, the antennal lobes (ALs). Precise volume measurements of a subset of their functional units, the glomeruli, were performed in both sides of the brain, exploiting the advantages of two-photon microscopy. This novel method allowed minimal invasive acquisition of volume images of the ALs, avoiding artefacts from brain extraction and dehydration. The study was completed by a series of behavioural experiments in which response asymmetry in odour recall following proboscis extension reflex conditioning was assessed for odours, chosen to stimulate strong activity in the same glomeruli as in the morphological study. The volumetric measurements found no evidence of lateralization in the investigated glomeruli within the experimental limits.

In meliponaries of Scaptotrigona mexicana, it is usual to observe drones forming such congregations close to the nests, apparently waiting for a virgin queen for mating. We hypothesize that drones of this species, similarly to those of A. mellifera and the stingless bee Scaptotrigona postica, use olfactory signals to detect queens and evaluate their reproductive status. In both field and laboratory experiments, our results showed that S. mexicana drones were able to differentiate between virgin and physogastric queens. It seems that this ability to discriminate depends on the amount of 2-alcohols, since even though no differences were observed in the qualitative content between virgin and physogastric queens, these compounds were found in larger quantities in the virgin queens. Attraction is due to compounds found in the queen head, mainly 2-alcohols, where 2-nonanol is the most significant for drone attraction in field and laboratory bioassays and for eliciting a high drone antennal response. © INRA, DIB-AGIB and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., 2011.","Behavior; Drones; EAG; Scaptotrigona mexicana",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054681228

Although many species are known to provide pollination services, honeybees (Apis mellifera) are often assumed to provide the majority of these services to agriculture. Using data from a range of secondary sources, this study assesses the importance of insect pollinated crops at regional and national scales and investigates the capacity of honeybees to provide optimal pollination services to UK agriculture. The findings indicate that insect pollinated crops have become increasingly important in UK crop agriculture and, as of 2007, accounted for 20% of UK cropland and 19% of total farmgate crop value. Analysis of honeybee hive numbers indicates that current UK populations are only capable of supplying 34% of pollination service demands even under favourable assumptions, falling from 70% in 1984. In spite of this decline, insect pollinated crop yields have risen by an average of 54% since 1984, casting doubt on long held beliefs that honeybees provide the majority of pollination services. Future land use and crop production patterns may further increase the role of pollination services to UK agriculture, highlighting the importance of measures aimed at maintaining both wild and managed species. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Crop pollination; Ecosystem ser vices; Honeybees; Pollination services",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051582930

In this context, we evaluated the impact of nutritional manipulations on worker physiology and colony demography. Specifically, we manipulated protein availability by feeding colonies on royal jelly, lowquality pollen, or regular pollen stores. After acclimation to these treatments, experimental cohorts of workers were introduced and later assessed with regards to life expectancy, protein content, and intestinal stem cell proliferation. We also monitored their hives for the amount of workers, brood, and pollen trapped in front of the hive entrances. Workers that fed on royal jelly showed a reduced rate of intestinal stem cell proliferation at nurse bee age. Total soluble protein content of individuals and adult worker lifespan were not systematically affected. However, we cannot exclude an auxiliary role of poor nutrition to declining bee health by weakening the intestinal epithelium. In contrast to the weak experimental effects on individual variables, the brood production differed drastically among the experimental hives. Although not yet replicated, this observation might indicate that hive demographic plasticity rather than individual plasticity is important for acclimation to different food regimes. © INRA, DIB-AGIB and Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.","Demographic plasticity; Intestinal stem cells; Mortality; Nutrition; Pollen",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054680234

Previous research has shown that when wax combs are reciprocally swapped between two colonies, guards become more accepting of workers from the swap partner. However, when combs were transferred only one way, guards in the comb-receiver colony became more accepting of bees from the comb-donor colony, but not vice versa. Hence, the increased acceptance of non-nestmates caused by reciprocal comb swapping was not because of introduced bees acquiring odours from the transferred combs, which was surprising because comb wax was known to affect the odour of bees. In the current experiment, we caused workers to acquire either nestmate or non-nestmate odours by holding them for 15min in a tube, which had previously held nestmates or non-nestmates and then measured their acceptance by entrance guards of nestmate or non-nestmate hives. When transferred workers had acquired odours of non-nestmates, acceptance by their own colony's guards significantly decreased to 66% from 91%. Conversely, the acceptance of non-nestmates that had acquired odours of the guards' own nestmates was unchanged, 25% vs. 25%. These results show that when equivalent changes in the odour of introduced bees are made, guards are more sensitive to changes that cause nestmates to acquire non-nestmate odours than vice versa. These results are also a likely explanation for the earlier and surprising results from the unidirectional comb swap experiment (Couvillon et al. 2007).

Mourera fluviatilis belongs to the family and has a disjunct distribution in the Amazon and northeastern Brazil. The following hypotheses were tested: (i) both autogamy and anemophily act on the pollination system of M. fluviatilis, and (ii) the highest reproductive success is achieved by cross-pollination. Natural populations were monitored in the rivers Pirangi and Ipojuca, northeastern Brazil. Floral visitors are the polylectic bees Apis mellifera, Trigona spinipes (Apidae), Augochlora sp. and Augochloropsis sp. (Halictidae), though only the latter three are effective pollinators. In experiments on the reproductive system and pollination there was a high percentage of fruit formation (>86%), both in treatment and control plants. Although the index of self-incompatibility is 0.86, there was a significant difference in the number of seeds produced among reproductive system treatments, and xenogamy produced more seeds. There was no significant difference in the number of penetrated ovules between control and manual cross-pollination (xenogamy) treatments, 24. h after pollination. However, there were differences among treatments, 48. h after pollination, except for the control and xenogamy treatments. The pollen tubes from cross-pollination treatments usually penetrate the micropyle in shorter time and in higher quantity. We found differences among pollination experiments, except for the control and non-emasculated treatments, and between emasculated treatments. In spite of the ambiguity of floral attributes (pedicel, filaments and anthers colors, sweet odor, reduced perianth, absence of nectar, small and dry pollen grains), wind pollination is less important for this species; what predominates instead are first allogamy mediated by bees and second self-pollination at the end of anthesis. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Allogamy; Anemophily; Aquatic plant; Atlantic Rain Forest; Entomophily; Lotic habitat",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960015664

However some insecticides employed in maize seed dressing, namely belonging to the neonicotinoid family and fipronil, have been claimed to play a role in the decline of honeybees (Apis mellifera L.). Pneumatic drills used in maize sowing are charged with contributing to the dispersion of the abrasion dust produced by dressed seeds, favoring the contamination of the honeybee habitat. Different devices similar to air deflectors have been introduced on pneumatic drills in order to reduce dust drift. During previous field tests carried out by the authors during recent years reduction of dust concentration both in the air and at soil surface has been shown as a consequence of their application. As field tests are affected by the variability of environmental parameters (namely wind speed and direction) the results are not always reliable, comparable and of a general validity. This paper refers to a sowing simulation test system in which pneumatic drills can be tested at a fixed point under controlled conditions of the main environmental parameters. In the test area, protected by external influences, artificial wind conditions are created by means of a fan. The drill, suitably placed in the test area, operates the seed distribution ""sur place"" by means of an electric engine connected to the drill's driving wheel. A 22.5m long sampling area, leeward with respect to the drill position, has been identified. Along the sampling area a series of Petri dishes has been placed, with the aim of capturing the depositing dust and providing the concentration of the active ingredients (a.i.) at ground level. At the same time, three air samplers with PTFE diskette filters have been used for the detection of the a.i. The test system has been used for the test of a pneumatic drill, equipped with and without air deflectors, using maize seed dressed with four a. i. (imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiametoxam, fipronil). The results showed regularly decreasing of the concentrations as distance increased, both in the air and at ground level. Moreover, the difference determined by the adoption of the drift reducing device (air deflectors) resulted clear and it can be quantified at around 50% of the a.i. amounts observed without deflectors. Finally, the paper proposes a data processing method that, from the values observed at fixed point, provides the theoretical a.i. concentration behavior that would occur in field, under the same conditions of wind speed and direction and working speed. The obtained results are coherent with previous field test. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Dust drift; Honey bee; Neonicotinoids; Pesticides; Seed coating",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960513350

We ask here whether the wood ant Formica rufa learns a sequence of visual features encountered at different stages along a route, as reported for honeybees. We trained ants in several simple mazes to follow two alternative routes. Along each two-stage route, the ants first encountered one of two priming stimuli. The identity of the priming stimulus determined which of two choice stimuli was rewarded in the second stage of the route. As stimuli we used ultraviolet and yellow/green light panels, and two black-and-white patterns. Did ants learn to pair each colour with the appropriate black-andwhite pattern? Ants learnt readily to discriminate between the two coloured stimuli or between the two black-and-white patterns. They could also pair coloured and black-and-white patterns, provided that the two were presented simultaneously. The ants' behaviour with sequential stimuli varied according to whether the priming stimulus was a coloured stimulus or a black-and-white pattern. When the priming stimulus was coloured, ants seemed to learn the two sequences, but tests showed that their success was probably caused by the after-effects of colour adaptation. With a black-and-white priming stimulus and a coloured second stage stimulus, robust sequential learning could not be demonstrated, although under certain experimental conditions a tiny proportion of ants did acquire the sequence. Thus, ants perform conditional discriminations reliably when priming and choice stimuli are simultaneous, but they usually fail when the stimuli are sequential. © 2011.

In the soil the highly nutritious provisions can be attacked by a large number of microorganisms. We investigated the effect of fungal infestations of larval provisions on the reproductive success of beewolves. Although fungal infestations reduced larval survival, female beewolves largely eliminated this effect by embalming larval provisions with ample amounts of hydrocarbons.

This study was conducted to determine the influence of brood removal and subsequent host reinvasion of varroa mites on mite reproduction. We collected foundress mites from stages of brood (newly sealed larvae, prepupae, white-eyed pupae, and pink-eyed pupae) and phoretic mites from adult bees. We then inoculated these mites into cells containing newly sealed larvae. Successful reproduction (foundress laid both a mature male and female) was low (13%) but most common in mites coming from sealed larvae. Unsuccessful reproductive attempts (foundress failed to produce both a mature male and female) were most common in mites from sealed larvae (22%) and prepupae (61%). Lack of any progeny was most common for mites from white-eyed (83%) and pink-eyed pupae (92%). We also collected foundress mites from sealed larvae and transferred them to cells containing newly sealed larvae, prepupae, white-eyed pupae, or pink-eyed pupae. Successful reproduction only occurred in the transfers to sealed larvae (26%). Unsuccessful reproductive attempts were most common in transfers to newly sealed larvae (40%) and to prepupae (25%). Unsuccessful attempts involved the production of immature progeny (60%), the production of only mature daughters (26%) or the production of only a mature male (14%). Generally, lack of progeny was not associated with mites having a lack of stored sperm. Our results suggest that mites exposed to the removal of prepupae or older brood due to hygiene are unlikely to produce viable mites if they invade new hosts soon after brood removal. Asynchrony between the reproductive status of reinvading mites and the developmental stage of their reinvasion hosts may be a primary cause of NR mites in hygienic colonies. Even if reinvading mites use hosts having the proper age for infestation, only a minority of them will reproduce. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.","Asynchronous development; mating failure; nonreproduction; resistance; Varroa destructor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051756493

Imidacloprid has been detected and quantified by Triple Quadrupole HPLC-MS-MS. Pesticide persistence in the soil and its residues in pollen and in maize plants have been evaluated during the growing of maize plants developed from seeds dressed with Gaucho 350 FS (imidacloprid: 1.0 mg/seed). The sowing has been performed by means of a pneumatic precision drill. Samples have been collected at 30, 45, 60, 80, 130 days after the sowing, as pollen samples have been collected at the tasseling. Imidacloprid presence in aerial part of maize plant declined to 2-3 μg/kg 80 days after the sowing, while concentration in kernel at harvest was <1 μg/kg. Maize pollen represents an important part of protein supply of beehives, and it is of critical importance to bee foraging.

After colonizing, the cages were transferred into an air-conditioned chamber. The chamber was kept at a constant temperature of 26°C, and at 65% relative humidity. The bees were fed sugar syrup in a 1:1 ratio administered ad libitum from a syringe feeder. The type of interaction between bees with increased genotype variance was determined in laboratory tests. The Car bees collected more food in their honey sac than the Bcf bees. The mixed Car/Bcf bees more frequently exhibited non-additive interactions. It is probable that the Bcf bees transferred the syrup to one another within their breed, and did not exchange it with the Car bees through the trophallaxis process. Food intake by the bees showed a signifi cant correlation with mortality.

Numerous mechanisms could be behind this decline, and the spread of parasites from commercial colonies into wild populations has been implicated recently in North America. Commercial breeding may lead to declines because commercial colonies may have high parasite loads, which can lead to colonization of native bumble bee populations; commercial rearing may allow higher parasite virulence to evolve; and global movement of commercial colonies may disrupt spatial patterns in local adaptation between hosts and parasites. We assessed parasite virulence, transmission mode, and infectivity. Microparasites and so-called honey bee viruses may pose the greatest threat to native bumble bee populations because certain risk factors are present; for example, the probability of horizontal transmission of the trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi is high. The microsporidian parasite Nosema bombi may play a role in declines of bumble bees in the United States. Preliminary indications that C. bombi and the neogregarine Apicystis bombi may not be native in parts of South America. We suggest that the development of molecular screening protocols, thorough sanitation efforts, and cooperation among nongovernmental organizations, governments, and commercial breeders might immediately mitigate these threats. ©2011 Society for Conservation Biology.","Bombus; Commercial rearing; Pathogen spillover; Protozoan parasites; Viruses",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960475562

A similar number of colonies (74%) were infected with Nosema spp. parasites. Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) was detected in 35% of the examined colonies and chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) was found in only 7,8% of the colonies. The level of Varroa destructor and Nosema spp. infestation was high (averaged 192 mites per sample and 18 million Nosema spores per bee). Severe colony losses in examined apiaries could be attributed to the wide prevalence of V. destructor with DWV and ABPV infections, and/or Nosema spp. infestation.

The A. m. carnica (Car) and Buckfast (Bcf) bees used in the experiment differed in the genotypes and the colour of the cuticle. The different cuticle colours facilitated differentiation of the filmed bees and determination of the frequency of sugar syrup collection from feeders. The experiment was performed in two-comb mating hives colonized with 0.5 l of bees divided into three experimental groups: homogeneous - colonies colonized by Car (Car) bees (100%) only, mixed - colonies comprising 50% of Bcf bees and 50% of Car bees (Bcf/Car), and homogeneous- colonies containing Bcf (Bcf) bees (100%) only. Ten mating colonies per each group were thus colonized and provided with sister virgin queens. The type of cooperation between bees exhibiting increased genotype variance and colonizing the common colony during collection and storage of sugar syrup was determined. In favourable weather conditions, the Bcf bees were more efficient, whereas the Car bees displayed higher efficiency in adverse conditions. Mixed Car/Bcf bees in the common colony exhibited additive interactions and higher repeatability of results. This may be related to the better adaptation of the more and less efficient mixed bees to both favourable and adverse environmental conditions.","Apis mellifera; Bees; Mixed colonies; Syrup; Worker interactions",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960809661

We compare this genome with three previously sequenced genomes of ants from different subfamilies and focus our analyses on aspects of the genome likely to be associated with known evolutionary changes. The first is the specialized fungal diet of A. echinatior, where we find gene loss in the ant's arginine synthesis pathway, loss of detoxification genes, and expansion of a group of peptidase proteins. One of these is a unique ant-derived contribution to the fecal fluid, which otherwise consists of ""garden manuring"" fungal enzymes that are unaffected by ant digestion. The second is multiple mating of queens and ejaculate competition, which may be associated with a greatly expanded nardilysin-like peptidase gene family. The third is sex determination, where we could identify only a single homolog of the feminizer gene. As other ants and the honeybee have duplications of this gene, we hypothesize that this may partly explain the frequent production of diploid male larvae in A. echinatior. The fourth is the evolution of eusociality, where we find a highly conserved ant-specific profile of neuropeptide genes that may be related to caste determination. These first analyses of the A. echinatior genome indicate that considerable genetic changes are likely to have accompanied the transition from hunter-gathering to agricultural food production 50 million years ago, and the transition from single to multiple queen mating 10 million years ago. © 2011 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051559742

The two main bee species reared in Malaysia are Apis cerana (local bees) and Apis mellifera (imported bees). The study was conducted to ascertain the benefits to beekeepers in the pineapple smallholdings under the potential incentive for agriculture and agro-based industry. It was an attempt to look at how much a beekeeper can actually earn after taking into account the incentives provided. Data for this study were collected from surveys involving beekeepers rearing Apis mellifera in Johor. The methods used include the common project evaluation indicators and its impact on the potential incentive. The results indicate that beekeeping projects provide additional income to farmers and higher returns with government incentives. The extra income was solely derived from selling of honey.

The role of pollinators in the evolution of floral traits has been questioned recently by broad community surveys, especially studies concerning variation in pollinator assemblages and visitation frequency, which suggest a diminished role of pollinators in floral evolution. Here, we investigate the relationships between six categories of floral traits of 29 species and 10 pollinator functional groups in an alpine meadow in the Hengduan Mountains of China, over three consecutive years. Simpson's diversity index was used to estimate the level of pollinator generalization of each plant species by considering both pollinator groups and their relative visitation frequencies. Multivariate analyses indicated that eight of the ten pollinator groups showed constant preferences for at least two floral traits, leading to a relatively stable level of ecological generalization for most floral traits (two out of three categories), despite the fact that the level of generalization of the entire community varied across years. Shape preferences of butterflies, honeybees and beeflies varied such that open flowers exhibited a lower level of ecological generalization in 2007 than closed flowers, in contrast with the other 2 years. These results suggest that temporally stabilized preferences of diverse pollinators may contribute to the evolution of specialized versus generalized floral traits; however, their role may be moderated by variation in community structure, including both the composition and abundance of plants and pollinators. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Ecological generalization level; Floral traits; Generalization and specialization; Temporal variation; Visitation frequency",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958734441

IIS and Egfr signaling events are also involved in the developmental process of queen and worker differentiation in honey bees (Apis mellifera). Here, we characterized the bee PTEN gene homologue for the first time and begin to explore its potential function during bee development and adult life. Results: Honey bee PTEN is alternatively spliced, resulting in three splice variants. Next, we show that the expression of PTEN can be down-regulated by RNA interference (RNAi) in the larval stage, when female caste fate is determined. Relative to controls, we observed that RNAi efficacy is dependent on the amount of PTEN dsRNA that is delivered to larvae. For larvae fed queen or worker diets containing a high amount of PTEN dsRNA, PTEN knockdown was significant at a whole-body level but lethal. A lower dosage did not result in a significant gene down-regulation. Finally, we compared same-aged adult workers with different behavior: nursing vs. foraging. We show that between nurses and foragers, PTEN isoforms were differentially expressed within brain, ovary and fat body tissues. All isoforms were expressed at higher levels in the brain and ovaries of the foragers. In fat body, isoform B was expressed at higher level in the nurse bees. Conclusion: Our results suggest that PTEN plays a central role during growth and development in queen- and worker-destined honey bees. In adult workers, moreover, tissue-specific patterns of PTEN isoform expression are correlated with differences in complex division of labor between same-aged individuals. Therefore, we propose that knowledge on the roles of IIS and Egfr activity in developmental and behavioral control may increase through studies of how PTEN functions can impact bee social phenotypes. © 2011 Mutti et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960326936

In Brazil, weather conditions and the strains of bees do not provide ideal conditions for mite parasitism, which is reflected in the low number of deaths of colonies caused by varroatosis well as the stability of infestation levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the damage caused by the mite infestation in hives maintained in natural conditions. For this purpose the number of mites per bee was calculated and used to quantify the level of infestation in each colony. To record the mortality rates of parasitized bees during development daily checks were performed. The data were analyzed by G test of independence and a Test of Proportions. The results indicate that the rate of mortality of pupae and larvae was proportional to the degree of infestation in each colony, and all colonies showed mortality rates significantly higher than the control rate. A significant interaction among death rates recorded between the third and fourth days of larval life and the total death of larvae was found (G Test - 50.22; P < 0.0001). So, it can be concluded that bee inbreeding contributed significantly to the increase of the larval rate of mortality. In Africanized honeybee colonies infested by the mite Varroa destructor mortality rates in conditions of natural infestation varied from 6.65 to 9.89% in pupae (x̄= 8.78%) and from 6.13 to 13.48% in larvae ( x̄ = 9.91%), against 3.85% and 3.74% in the control colony, respectively. Therefore, in the infested colonies the average rates of mortality caused by the harmful effects of the mite were, respectively, 2.28 times and 2.65 times greater in those two developmental stages.","Africanized honeybees; Apis mellifera; Development; Mortality analysis; Varroa destructor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960238185

An isolate of IAPV was detected in China. Its genome was analyzed and compared with other IAPV isolates from different countries. The results revealed that the Chinese IAPV carried a 9482 nt RNA genome in positive orientation, with two open reading frames (ORF 1 and ORF 2) separated by an intergenic region of 184 nucleotides. Blastp analysis of the translated ORF1 recognized conserved domains for helicase, protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The Chinese isolate exhibited the highest (96.9%) nucleotide sequence identity with the original isolate (EF219380) from Israel across the complete genome. The amino acid sequences of ORF 1 and ORF 2 exhibited highest identities (96.9-98.8% and 97.1-99.0%, respectively) with other isolates (EF219380, EU436423, EU436455, EU436456, EU218534, EU224280, EU224279), which were much higher than the corresponding nucleotide regions (92.4-96.6% and 95.5-97.3%, respectively) within the genome. These data indicated that the nucleotide differences among the IAPV isolates were largely synonymous, suggesting purifying selection pressure on the viral genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of three geographically distinct IAPV lineages, the Chinese isolate representing a distinct lineage. Analysis of representatives from each proposed lineage suggested the possibility of recombination events. Whether the differences in the coding sequences of different IAPV isolates implicated their virulence potentials were discussed.","Apis mellifera; Honeybees; Israel acute paralysis virus; Phylogenetic analysis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960255955

Here we confirm flight activity of hornet workers in dim twilight. We studied the eyes and ocelli of European hornets (Vespa crabro) and common wasps (Vespula vulgaris) with the goal to find the optical and anatomical adaptations that enable them to fly in dim light. Adaptations described for obligately nocturnal hymenoptera such as the bees Xylocopa tranquebarica and Megalopta genalis and the wasp Apoica pallens include large ocelli and compound eyes with wide rhabdoms and large facet lenses. Interestingly, we did not find any such adaptations in hornet eyes or ocelli. On the contrary, their eyes are even less sensitive than those of the obligately diurnal common wasps. Therefore we conclude that hornets, like several facultatively nocturnal bee species such as Apis mellifera adansonii, A. dorsata and X. tenuiscapa are capable of seeing in dim light simply due to the large body and thus eye size. We propose that neural pooling strategies and behavioural adaptations precede anatomical adaptations in the eyes and ocelli when insects with apposition compound eyes turn to dim light activity. © 2011 Kelber et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960156827

It is used by bacteria to control the colony behavior for a variety of functions, such as biofilm construction or initiating pathogenicity inside a host. It is used by social insects including the ant Temnothorax albipennis to collectively evaluate and select from amongst potentially many new nesting sites.Honeybees (Apis mellifera) use quorum sensing to collectively choose a new nesting site when the swarm grows too large and needs to split. It is shown that the quorum sensing paradigm may be used to provide robust decentralized team coordination and collective decision-making in mobile autonomous teams performing complex tasks.

HP and LP yields were compared with an unselected control (C) line. Our procedure provided a constant inflow of new genes from the C line to the HP and LP lines that is useful in small apiaries. A significant (p < 0.01), asymmetrical (greater in HP), direct response to selection was observed. Correlated responses were also detected in: the pollen forager ratio (proportion of the pollen forager number to the total forager number) and pollen forager number in the HP line; and single-pollen load weight, honey yield, stored pollen area, and brood area in the LP line. No response was found in the total forager number. Correlated selection pressures were detected in the pollen forager ratio (in HP and LP), the stored pollen area (mostly in LP), and the brood area (slight in LP). Taken together, these observations indicate that pollen yield is determined by a small number of major genes. The selection results and the correlated response patterns suggest that pollen yield, pollen forager ratio, and the stored pollen area were mostly genetically correlated, but correlations between the pollen yield and the other traits examined resulted from the environmental background or from worker interrelations within the colony that function as a network of mutually dependent processes. The correlated response was also asymmetrical; it was greater and involved more of the monitored traits in LP. Consequently, the high pollen-hoarding genetic potential decrease results in the reduction of colony fitness and other traits, but its increase does not impact on the other traits or fitness values, as within-colony inter-trait relationships are involved. © 2011 IBRA.","Correlated response; Honey bees; Pollen yield; Selection; Selection pressure",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052112011

To do this, we confined ∼250 adult bees each to 144, 0.47 l glass jars, feeding them bee candy (honey / powdered sugar) ad lib. Seventy-two hours later, the bees were treated with 5 g of one of the ten materials and placed in one of two locations (in an incubator = 35°C, 70% RH, or in a dark room = 22°C, 50% RH; replicate schedule = 10 dusts and 2 controls × 6 jars / rep × 2 locations). Immediately after and 24 h after treatment application, we counted the number of mites that fell from the jar through the mesh lid when the jar was rolled for 30 s, inverted, and shaken for 30 s. Four days later, we estimated the number of bees alive in each jar and washed the bees to remove any remaining mites. With these data, we determined the mite drop efficacy of the materials and their acute impact on adult bee survivorship. In general, powdered sugar from Slovenia (82.7 ± 4.1: mean ± s.e. % mite fall), vacuum collected sugar (83.2 ± 2.8), baby powder (83.8 ± 5), and ground table sugar (69.6 ± 5.5) induced higher levels of mite fall than the other materials.

Although these species are cultivated for medicinal purposes, they also represent a significant source of pollen and nectar for honey production, so the investigation aimed to estimate their melliferousness and significance for bee pasture. Pollinator observation indicated the visitation of seven species of Hymenoptera, three species of Diptera and two species of day flying Lepidoptera. The honey bee (Apis mellifera) was the most abundant pollinator, and the major elements of attractiveness were flower scent and colour, followed by the shape and size of the corolla and to a lesser extent nectar abundance. Corolla tube length and number of open flowers per whorl were of little significance. According to all analyzed flower characteristics and observation of pollinator behaviour and visits, the most attractive plants were H. officinalis, S. officinalis and L. officinalis, whilst M. officinalis was the least attractive and S. sclarea completely unattractive to all recorded pollinators except for Xylocopa violacea. © 2011 IBRA.","Flower morphology; Honey bee; Lamiaceae; Nectar production; Pollination",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052155372

Viral infections are often cited as the potential cause for increased mortality. Many honey bee viruses commonly occur within bee populations and in many cases infected colonies appear asymptomatic. There is increasing evidence that the global spread of Varroa destructor has resulted in a significant change in the prevalence, distribution and / or virulence of viruses causing mortality in honey bee colonies. We report here the first survey of the prevalence of five RNA bee viruses and their effect on overwintering survival of Belgian honey bee colonies. In the autumn of 2006, samples of adult bees were removed from 36 apiaries. Adult bee samples were analyzed by using RT-PCR for virus identification. Varroa mite prevalence in these samples was also quantified. A follow up visit of colonies in the spring permitted us to assess colony survivorship which permitted the effect, if any, of autumn varroa loads, virus presence and queen condition on colony survivorship to be ascertained. Although acute bee paralysis virus was the least prevalent of the detected honey bee viruses, it was strongly linked with increased colony mortality. Co-infection with more than two viruses also had an appreciable negative effect on colony survivorship. © 2011 IBRA.","Honey bee mortality; Varroa destructor; Varroa mite; Virus; Winter mortality",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052119532

The fauna has been the focus of much scrutiny by early authors who recognized multiple species or subspecies within the fauna. The history of work on the Randeck Maar is briefly reviewed and these fossils placed into context with other Tertiary and living species of the genus Apis Linnaeus (Apinae: Apini). Previously unrecorded specimens from Randeck Maar were compared with earlier series in an attempt to evaluate the observed variation. A morphometric analysis of forewing venation angles across representative Recent and Tertiary species of Apis as well as various non-Apini controls was undertaken to evaluate the distribution of variation in fossil honey bees. The resulting dendrogram shows considerable variation concerning the wing venation of Miocene Apini, but intergradation of other morphological characters reveals no clear pattern of separate species. This suggests that a single, highly variable species was present in Europe during the Miocene. The pattern also supports the notion that the multiple species and subspecies proposed by earlier authors for the Randeck Maar honey bee fauna are not valid, and all are accordingly recognized as Apis armbrusteri Zeuner. © U.

Two methods were deployed to measure the degree of infestation of bee colonies with V. destructor mites: the sugar shake method and the technique which involves mesh bottom boards equipped with sticky inserts. The research was carried out on 30 strong honey bee colonies in three successive years. The results proved that dusting with pulverised sugar (particle diameter below 40 μm) influenced the fall of V. destructor in comparison with both their fall off prior to the treatment and the negative control. The most discernible effects on the mite fall and the decline in their population in the hives was obtained with dustings repeated at threeday intervals. To conclude, the dynamics of the treatment affected the degree of infestation in bee colonies. However, the efficacy of sugar dusting was significantly lower in comparison with the one of flumethrin (positive control). Thus, in spite of considerable favourable effects on the decline in the degree of infestation with mites, by no means may dusting with pulverised sugar be advised to beekeepers as the one and only means of bee protection against V. destructor. The use of the technique which involves mesh bottom boards equipped with sticky inserts proved more efficacious and sensitive in the judgment of the degree of infestation of bee colonies in comparison with the sugar shake method, which includes dusting 300 bees with 40 g of pulverised sugar (particle diameter below 40 μm).","Apis mellifera; Mesh bottom board; Sugar-dusting; Sugar-shake method; Varroa infestation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959948144

We identified the mating frequency of queens by genotyping worker offspring (n = 672) of 28 wild colonies with microsatellite DNA markers. The populations sampled in different climatic regions in Sudan showed a high variance for the queen mating frequency ranging from 9 to 23 estimated matings with an average of 14.00 ± 3.94 (13.16 ± 4.87 effective matings). The degree of polyandry was highly significantly correlated with the rainfall in the various regions. In general, more rainfall resulted in lower mating frequencies. Polyandry did not correlate with colony density or with genetic diversity of the local sample populations. This suggests that variation in polyandry in wild honeybee populations of Sudan is primarily driven by climatic differences among ecosystem variation rather than by the absolute or effective local honeybee population size. © 2011 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer.","Colony density; Ecosystems; Microsatellite DNA; Queen mating",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958124634

In order to achieve this goal, different AmV treatments were performed and the effects were quantified on transmission electron micrographs. In a first experimental group, AmV injected for 30 days in low daily doses (700μg/kg) generated important ultrastructural changes in zona fasciculata. The mitochondrial ultrastructure was not affected, but the diameters of mitochondrial cristae (MC) were reduced (57.066 ± 7.795 nm) as compared to the MC diameters in the corresponding control groups (58.596 ± 6.603 nm, and 58.503 ± 5.708 nm). In adrenal glands collected from rats injected with a single, high dose of AmV (62. mg/kg), many ultrastructural changes were described. Mitochondria with normal, tubular MC (with diameter of 58.711 ± 5.907 nm) were observed in many cells, very close to the values calculated for the corresponding control group (58.639 ± 6.117 nm). However, the striking data reported herein concerned the ability of AmV high doses to promote dramatic alterations in the ultrastructure of these particular mitochondria, similar to those described in certain severe diseases. Thus, several types of abnormal mitochondria were observed, including mitochondria displaying lamellar and/or circular, concentric cristae and mitochondria devoid of cristae. The abnormal circular, concentric MC, with large inner (281.904 ± 158.588 nm) and outer (432.076 ± 230.372 nm) diameters, appeared to be the most stable form of MC in the adrenal cortex after the acute treatment with AmV. Among other ultrastructural aspects, these important changes indicated a high level of cytotoxicity of AmV in adrenocortical cells following in vivo experimental poisoning. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Adrenal cortex; Apis mellifera venom; Concentric cristae; Mitochondria; Ultrastructure",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952625428

As adults, male and female bees are subject to differing selective pressures: worker bees (females) exhibit temporal polyethism, while the male drones invest in mating. They are further influenced by changes in the threat of pathogen infection at different life stages. We investigated the immune response of workers and drones at all developmental phases, from larvae through to late stage adults, assaying both a constitutive (phenoloxidase, PO activity) and induced (antimicrobial peptide, AMP) immune response. We found that larval bees have low levels of PO activity. Adult workers produced stronger immune responses than drones, and a greater plasticity in immune investment. Immune challenge resulted in lower levels of PO activity in adult workers, which may be due to the rapid utilisation and a subsequent failure to replenish the constitutive phenoloxidase. Both adult workers and drones responded to an immune challenge by producing higher titres of AMPs, suggesting that the cost of this response prohibits its constant maintenance. Both castes showed signs of senescence in immune investment in the AMP response. Different sexes and life stages therefore alter their immune system management based on the combined factors of disease risk and life history. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Honey bee; Immunity; Ontogeny; Phenoloxidase; Sex biased immunity; Temporal polyethism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959909039

To investigate damage to Varroa mites and regular dorsal dimples, 32 honey bee (A. mellifera) colonies were selected from four Iranian provinces: Isfahan, Markazi, Qazvin, and Tehran. These colonies were part of the National Honey bee Breeding Program that resulted in province-specific races. In April, Varroa mites were collected from heavily infested colonies and used to infest the 32 experimental colonies. In August, 20 of these colonies were selected (five colonies from each province). Adult bees from these colonies were placed in cages and after introducing mites, damaged mites were collected from each cage every day. The average percentage of injured mites ranged from 0.6 to 3.0% in four provinces. The results did not show any statistical differences between the colonies within provinces for injuries to mites, but there were some differences among province-specific lines. Two kinds of injuries to the mites were observed: injuries to legs and pedipalps, and injuries to other parts of the body. There were also some regular dorsal dimples on dorsal idiosoma of the mites that were placed in categories separate from mites damaged by bees. This type of classification helps identifying damage to mites and comparing them with developmental origin symptoms, and may provide criteria for selecting bees tolerant or resistant to this mite. © 2011 The Author(s).","Grooming behaviour; Regular dorsal dimples; Varroa destructor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957949192

Wistar rats were subcutaneously injected once with three different BV doses: 700 μg/kg (T1 group), 2100 μg/kg (T3 group), and 62 mg/kg (sublethal dose-in TSL group), and repeated for 30 days with the lowest dose (700 μg/kg-in TS group). BV effects were assessed by electrophysiological, histological, histochemical, and ultrastructural methods. Single BV doses produced discharges of negative and biphasic sharp waves, and epileptiform spike-wave complexes. The increasing frequency of these elements suggested a dose-dependent neuronal hyperexcitation or irritation. As compared to the lower doses, the sublethal dose was responsible for a pronounced toxic effect, confirmed by ultrastructural data in both neurons and glial cells that underwent extensive, irreversible changes, triggering the cellular death. Subchronic BV treatment in TS group resulted in a slower frequency and increased amplitude of cortical activity suggesting neuronal loss. However, neurons were still stimulated by the last BV dose. Structural-functional data showed a reduced cellular density in frontal cortex of animals in this group, while the remaining neurons displayed both specific (stimulation of neuronal activity) and unspecific modifications (moderate alterations to necrotic phenomena). Molecular mechanisms involved in BV interactions with the nervous tissue are also discussed. We consider all these data very important for clinicians who manage patients with multiple bee stings, or who intend to set an appropriate BV therapy. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Bee venom; Brain electrophysiology; Cellular death; Experimental envenomation; Frontal cortex; Transmission electron microscopy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959583836

We studied systemic RNAi in honeybees by injecting fluorescent siRNA of the ubiquitously expressed honeybee homologue of the Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (amGpdh) into the abdomens of adult bees and followed them by laser scanning microscopy and qPCR. The fat body was the sole tissue emitting fluorescence and showing a decreased gene expression, whereas the siRNA had apparently not reached the other tissues. Therefore, we conclude that certain genes in other tissues than the fat body cannot be easily reached by injecting siRNA into the body cavity.

Correa which is of considerable socio-economic importance and possess morphogenetic variation and qualities of wider adaptability to different soils. Cytology, phenology, pollination, breeding system and natural regeneration of wild and cultivated trees from India revealed the existence of diploid (2n = 18) and tetraploid trees (2n = 36) in Pachmarhi hills and only diploid trees in Punjab plains and Shiwalik hills. The diploid and tetraploid trees showed normal meiosis and high pollen fertility. Phenological events which included leaf fall, leaf emergence, floral bud break, flowering and fruiting are nearly the same in wild and cultivated trees. Natural pollen transfer in the species was highly efficient. Levels of fruit set following open pollination was quite high and is reduced considerably following hand pollination probably due to some injury caused to stigma during experiments. Inspite of synchronous nature of anther dehiscence and stigmatic receptivity, selfing in a flower was avoided due to herkogamy. Some selfing, however, occurred through geitonogamous mode as bagging of panicles yielded 12. 21 ± 0. 99 to 14. 12 ± 0. 91% fruit set. High pollen ovule ratio (9,250-10,600) indicated toward the obligate outbreeding nature. The species suited to insect and wind mode of pollination. High amount of air borne pollen grains deposited on glycerine smeared glass microscopic slides suggested towards the wind mode of pollination. Though flowers are dull coloured a variety of insects visited the flowers due to sweet fragrance and stamen/pollen as food reward. Among insect pollinators, honey bee (Apis dorsata) was the major and legitimate pollinator while the rest were either minor pollinators or mere visitors. Inspite of high fruit/seed set, natural regeneration through seeds was poor as fallen fruits were destroyed by fungal pathogens and white ants. The species also propagated vegetatively through coppices and root suckers. It lacks agamospermy as bagging of emasculated flowers yielded no fruit. It is inferred that 'bael' which lacks agamospermy reproduced successfully through gamospermy (xenogamy and geitonogamy) and vegetative mode (coppices and root suckers). We also concluded that tetraploid trees growing in the Pachmarhi hills with large sized fruits possessed better potentialities in horticulture if planted through root suckers or coppices. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Aegle marmelos; Breeding system; Cytology; Gamospermy; Geitonogamy; Pollination; Vegetative propagation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958013727

Two major sets of uniglomerular projection neurons innervate glomeruli from two antennal-lobe hemispheres and project via a medial and a lateral antennal-lobe protocerebral tract in opposite sequence to the mushroom bodies and lateral horn. Comparison across insects suggests that the lateral projection neuron tract represents a special feature of Hymenoptera. We hypothesize that this promotes advanced olfactory processing associated with chemical communication, orientation and social interactions. To test whether a dual olfactory pathway is restricted to social Hymenoptera, we labeled the antennal lobe output tracts in selected species using fluorescent tracing and confocal imaging. Our results show that a dual pathway from the antennal lobe to the mushroom bodies is present in social bees, basal and advanced ants, solitary wasps, and in one of two investigated species of sawflies. This indicates that a dual olfactory pathway is not restricted to social species and may have evolved in basal Hymenoptera. We suggest that associated advances in olfactory processing represent a preadaptation for life styles with high demands on olfactory discrimination like parasitoism, central place foraging, and sociality. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Antennal lobe; Lateral horn; Mushroom body; Olfactory glomerulus; Projection neuron; Tract",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958792454

The honey bee larvae were subjected to ingestion of either pure larval diet (control), diluted larval diet (diluted control) or larval diet diluted in a Cry1Ac solution at a concentration compatible with the maximum possible field exposure. Although diluted diet slightly increased larval mortality, Cry1Ac ingestion did not affect survival, developmental time, and neither adult body mass nor size, indicating that GM plants are unlikely to significantly impair the development of honey bee larvae.

Results of controlled hand-pollinations conducted in situ in 2009 showed that this species had a negligible rate of self-pollination (mechanical autogamy) and showed classic Brassica-type, early-acting self-incompatibility.

Only four of these species (11%) were collected in all three years, but these four accounted for slightly more than a third of all individual bees collected. None of the bees were known specialists on flowers of the Brassicaceae and only two species were habitat (glade) specialists.

The use of microsatellite markers is limited by the difficulties involved in their de novo isolation from species for which no genomic resources are available. We describe here a high-throughput method for isolating microsatellite markers based on coupling multiplex microsatellite enrichment and next-generation sequencing on 454 GS-FLX Titanium platforms. The procedure was calibrated on a model species (Apis mellifera) and validated on 13 other species from various taxonomic groups (animals, plants and fungi), including taxa for which severe difficulties were previously encountered using traditional methods. We obtained from 11497 to 34483 sequences depending on the species and the number of detected microsatellite loci ranged from 199 to 5791. We thus demonstrated that this procedure can be readily and successfully applied to a large variety of taxonomic groups, at much lower cost than would have been possible with traditional protocols.

Studies performed for twenty years suggest that this decline may involve both infectious diseases and exposure to pesticides. Joint action of pathogens and chemicals are known to threaten several organisms but the combined effects of these stressors were poorly investigated in honeybees. Our study was designed to explore the effect of Nosema ceranae infection on honeybee sensitivity to sublethal doses of the insecticides fipronil and thiacloprid. Methodology/Finding: Five days after their emergence, honeybees were divided in 6 experimental groups: (i) uninfected controls, (ii) infected with N. ceranae, (iii) uninfected and exposed to fipronil, (iv) uninfected and exposed to thiacloprid, (v) infected with N. ceranae and exposed 10 days post-infection (p.i.) to fipronil, and (vi) infected with N. ceranae and exposed 10 days p.i. to thiacloprid. Honeybee mortality and insecticide consumption were analyzed daily and the intestinal spore content was evaluated 20 days after infection. A significant increase in honeybee mortality was observed when N. ceranae-infected honeybees were exposed to sublethal doses of insecticides. Surprisingly, exposures to fipronil and thiacloprid had opposite effects on microsporidian spore production. Analysis of the honeybee detoxification system 10 days p.i. showed that N. ceranae infection induced an increase in glutathione-S-transferase activity in midgut and fat body but not in 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase activity. Conclusions/Significance: After exposure to sublethal doses of fipronil or thiacloprid a higher mortality was observed in N. ceranae-infected honeybees than in uninfected ones. The synergistic effect of N. ceranae and insecticide on honeybee mortality, however, did not appear strongly linked to a decrease of the insect detoxification system. These data support the hypothesis that the combination of the increasing prevalence of N. ceranae with high pesticide content in beehives may contribute to colony depopulation. © 2011 Vidau et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959640170

Honeybee, Apis mellifera, foragers also shift their work schedules, but how flexible they are in the timing of sleep as they shift the timing of work is unknown, despite the importance of colony-level plasticity in the face of a changing environment. We hypothesized that sleep schedules of foragers are not fixed and instead vary depending on the time when food is available. We trained bees to visit a food source made available for several hours in the early morning (AM) or several hours in the late afternoon (PM), then monitored their sleep behaviour for 24. h after training, specifically comparing their sleep during the AM and PM periods previously designated as training periods. Following AM training, honeybee foragers slept more during the afternoon than during the morning, but following PM training, the same bees 'slept in' the next morning, and so slept more in the morning than in the afternoon. Although foragers did not change the total amount of time devoted to each of their behaviours (including sleep), the timing of their sleep did change. Thus, plasticity in timing of foraging was matched by plasticity in timing of sleep. The apparent correlation between the timing patterns of foraging and sleeping demonstrates temporal plasticity of sleep under ecologically realistic conditions in an invertebrate. Testing how shift work affects the health and performance of honeybees may shed light on the role of sleep in a nonhuman social animal. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Apis mellifera; Foraging; Honeybee; Nap; Plasticity; Shift work; Sleep",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958859515

This seems to be the case in motion vision, which is surprisingly similar in species as distant as honeybee and goldfish. In both visual systems, motion vision measured with the optomotor response is color blind and mediated by one photoreceptor type only. Here, we ask whether this is also the case if the moving stimulus is restricted to a small part of the visual field, and test what influence velocity may have on chromatic motion perception. Honeybees were trained to discriminate between clockwise- and counterclockwise-rotating sector disks. Six types of disk stimuli differing in green receptor contrast were tested using three different rotational velocities. When green receptor contrast was at a minimum, bees were able to discriminate rotation directions with all colored disks at slow velocities of 6 and 12 Hz contrast frequency but not with a relatively high velocity of 24 Hz. In the goldfish experiment, the animals were trained to detect a moving red or blue disk presented in a green surround. Discrimination ability between this stimulus and a homogenous green background was poor when the M-cone type was not or only slightly modulated considering high stimulus velocity (7 cm/s). However, discrimination was improved with slower stimulus velocities (4 and 2 cm/s). These behavioral results indicate that there is potentially an object motion system in both honeybee and goldfish, which is able to incorporate color information at relatively low velocities but is color blind with higher speed. We thus propose that both honeybees and goldfish have multiple subsystems of object motion, which include achromatic as well as chromatic processing. © Cambridge University Press 2011.","Apis mellifera; Carassius auratus; Color; Motion; Receptor contrast",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80055026493

We describe a novel 'streamlining' response in tethered, flying honeybees in which the abdomen is held in a raised position when the visual system is exposed to a pattern of image motion that is characteristic of forward flight. This visually evoked response, which can be elicited without exposing the insect to any airflow, presumably serves to reduce the aerodynamic drag that would otherwise be produced by the abdomen during real flight. The response is critically dependent on the presence of appropriate image motion everywhere within the large field of view of the insect. Thus, our results also underscore the importance of using panoramic stimulation for the study of visually guided flight in insects, and reveal the relative importance of various regions of the visual field in assessing the speed of flight through the environment. © 2011.

We measured the level of ICAM-1 in 13 venom-allergic patients before and after ultra-rush venom immunotherapy (VIT). Eight patients were treated by yellow jacket venom and 5 were treated by honeybee venom. Serum ICAM-1 levels were assayed by an immunoenzymatic method, with a detection limit of 0.35 ng/ml. The mean level of ICAM-1 changed from 316.4±78.2 ng/ml before VIT to 294.7±77.9 after VIT. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.019). These findings show that in patients with HVA there is an overexpression of ICAM-1, and that ultrarush VIT significantly decreases ICAM-1 levels. It is likely that the known ability of VIT to correct the imbalance in T lymphocytes subpopulations and in the associated production of cytokines may account for this observation. In fact, such cytokines include IL-4 and TNF-alpha, that upregulate adhesion molecules.

Specific proteins involved in odorant detection most likely supported this chemical communication. Odorant reception takes place mainly in the antennae within hairlike structures called olfactory sensilla. Antennal proteomes of sexually mature drone and forager worker bees (an age group of bees assigned to perform field tasks) were compared using two-dimensional electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and bioinformatics. Sixty-one differentially expressed proteins were identified in which 67% were highly upregulated in the drones' antennae whereas only 33% upregulated in the worker bees' antennae. The antennae of the worker bees strongly expressed carbohydrate and energy metabolism and molecular transporters signifying a strong demand for metabolic energy and odorant binding proteins for their foraging activities and other olfactory responses, while proteins related to fatty acid metabolism, antioxidation, and protein folding were strongly upregulated in the drones' antennae as an indication of the importance for the detection and degradation of sex pheromones during queen identification for mating. On the basis of both groups of altered antenna proteins, carbohydrate metabolism and energy production and molecular transporters comprised more than 80% of the functional enrichment analysis and 45% of the constructed biological interaction networks (BIN), respectively. This suggests these two protein families play crucial roles in the antennal olfactory function of sexually mature drone and forager worker bees. Several key node proteins in the BIN were validated at the transcript level. This first global proteomic comparative analysis of antennae reveals sex-biased protein expression in both bees, indicating that odorant response mechanisms are sex-specific because of natural selection for different olfactory functions. To the best of our knowledge, this result further provides extensive insight into the expression of the proteins in the antennae of drone and worker honeybees and adds vital information to the previous findings. It also provides a new angle for future detailed functional analysis of the antennae of the honeybee castes. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959991456

The fate of neonicotinoids and potential toxic side-effects on other (especially non-standard) organisms have received considerably less attention. In the present study, the environmental distribution and leaching potential of neonicotinoids registered for agricultural use in Brazil (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) were studied by applying several environmental fate models and indices. Potential risks to various environmental compartments were evaluated by applying ranking indices to the maximum application rates recommended in Brazil. Although bees were indeed found to be the most sensitive organism, the neonicotinoids also indicated potential environmental risks to other organism groups. Due to the greater maximum application rates recommended in Brazil as compared to other parts of the world, environmental risk and resistance potential for at least imidacloprid appears especially high in Brazil. Attention should thus also be allocated to organisms other than bees and to resistance potential when performing an environmental risk assessment of neonicotinoids if they are used at relatively high application rates. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Brazil; Environmental risk; Fate; Neonicotinoids; Resistance; Tropics",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960885811

There are marked differences in nectar properties among the two groups, implying that there has been pollinator-mediated selection on these traits. This raises the possibility that variation in bird assemblages among populations of a plant species could lead to the evolution of intraspecific variation in floral traits. We examined this hypothesis in Kniphofia linearifolia, a common and widespread plant in southern Africa. Although bees are common visitors to flowers of this species, exclusion of birds from inflorescences led to significant reductions in seed set, indicating that the species is primarily bird-pollinated. We showed that bird pollinator assemblages differ markedly between five different populations of K. linearifolia, and that variation in flower morphology and nectar properties between these populations are associated with the dominant guild of bird visitors at each population. We identified two distinct morphotypes, based on corolla length, nectar volume and nectar concentration, which reflect the bird assemblages found in each type. Further work is needed to establish if a natural geographic mosaic of bird assemblages are the ultimate cause of differentiation in floral traits in this species. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Bird pollination; Honeybee; Nectar; Pollination morphotypes; Red-hot poker",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959495104

However, at present, very little is known about the diversity and ecology of bacteria occurring in non-domesticated bees like bumblebees, which are of similar importance as honeybees for the pollination of agricultural and wild flowers. To fill this gap in knowledge, we examined six of the most common bumblebee species in Central Europe from three locations in Germany and Switzerland for their bacterial communities. We used a culture-independent molecular approach based on sequencing the 16S rRNA gene from a selection of individuals and examining a larger number of samples by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism profiles. The gut flora was dominated by very few and mostly undescribed groups of bacteria belonging to the Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. This core set of bacteria was present in all of the examined bumblebee species. These bacteria are similar to, but distinct from, bacteria previously described from the honeybee gut. Significant differences were observed between the communities of bacteria in the different bumblebee species; the effect of sampling location was less strong. A novel group of Betaproteobacteria additionally shows evidence for host species-specific genotypes. The gut flora of bumblebees therefore is apparently composed of relatively few highly specialized bacteria, indicating a strong interaction and possibly important functions with their hosts. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960597239

If patterns of genetic structure are determined largely by gene flow then they may be useful in predicting the likelihood of inbreeding or outbreeding depression but should be less useful if there is strong site-specific selection. For many Australian plants little is known about either their population genetics or the effects on mating systems of variation in pollen transfer distances. Experimental pollinations were used to compare the reproductive success of bird-adapted Grevillea mucronulata plants mated with individuals from a range of spatial scales. A hierarchical survey of microsatellite DNA variation was also conducted to describe the scale of population differentiation for neutral markers. • Methods: The effects of four pollen treatments on reproductive performance were compared. These treatments were characterized by transfer of pollen from (a) neighbouring adults; (b) an adjacent cluster of adults (30-50 m distant); (c) a distant cluster (&gt;5 km distant); and (d) open pollination. Sets of 17.9 ± 3·3 leaves from each of 15 clusters of plants were genotyped and spatial autocorrelation and F statistics were used to describe patterns of genetic structure. • Key Results: Grevillea mucronulata displayed evidence of both inbreeding and outbreeding depression, with 'intermediate' pollen producing consistently superior outcomes for most aspects of fitness including seed set, seed size, germination and seedling growth. Significant genotypic structuring was detected within clusters (spatial autocorrelation) and among adjacent clusters and clusters separated by &gt;5 km distance (F ST = 0.07 and 0·10). • Conclusions: The superior outcome of intermediate pollen transfer and genetic differentiation of adjacent clusters suggests that G. mucronulata selection disfavours matings among closely and distantly related neighbours. Moreover, the performance of open-pollinated seedlings was poor, implying that current mating patterns are suboptimal. © The Author 2011.

The size and number of offspring produced have been the focus of many studies. Offspring size affects survival and growth and determines offspring number in the many species where there is a trade-off between size and number. Many social insects reproduce by colony fission, whereby young queens and accompanying workers split off from a colony to form new colonies. The size of a new colony (number of workers) is set at the time of the split, and this may allow fine tuning size to local conditions. Despite the prevalence of colony fission and the ecological importance of social insects, little is known of colony fission except in honey bees. We studied colony fission in the ant Cataglyphis cursor. For clarity, ''colony'' and ''nest'' refer to colonies before and after colony fission, respectively (i.e., each colony fissions into several nests). The reproductive effort of colonies was highly variable: Colonies that fissioned varied markedly in size, and many colonies that did not fission were as large as some of the fissioning colonies. The mother queen was replaced in half of the fissioning colonies, which produced 4.0 6 1.3 (mean 6 SD) nests of markedly varied size. Larger fissioning colonies produced larger nests but did not produce more nests, and resource allocation among nests was highly biased. When a colony produced several nests and the mother queen was not replaced, the nest containing the mother queen was larger than nests with a young queen. These results show that the pattern of resource allocation differs between C. cursor and honey bees. They also suggest that C. cursor may follow a bet-hedging strategy with regard to both the colony size at which fission occurs and the partitioning of resources among nests. In addition, colony fission may be influenced by the age and/or condition of the mother queen, and the fact that workers allocating resources among nests have incomplete knowledge of the size and number of nests produced. These results show that the process of colony fission is more diverse than currently acknowledged and that studies of additional species are needed. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.","Bet-hedging; Cataglyphis cursor; Colony fissioning; Dependent Colony Foundation; Maternal investment; Offspring number; Offspring size; Reproductive strategy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960305250

Patients and Methods: Nineteen children aged 5-17 years received VIT with Venomenhal (HALAllergy). We analyzed serum tryptase (CAP, Phadia), plasma prostaglandin (PG) D2 metabolites (9α,11ß-PGF2), and urine PGD2 metabolites (9α,11ß-PGF2, tetranor-PGD-M) using gas chromatography mass spectrometry before and after the rush protocol. Results: Three boys with high baseline serum tryptase values (>7.76 μg/L) (P<.001) and low 9α,11ß-PGF2 concentrations developed grade III systemic adverse reactions during VIT. Baseline serum tryptase was lowest in children who had a Mueller grade II reaction (1.93 [0.36]) before VIT and highest in children with a Mueller grade III reaction (6.31 [4.80]) (P=.029). Repeated measures analysis of variance confi rmed that, in children who developed systemic adverse reactions during VIT, serum tryptase was higher both before and after desensitization and increased signifi cantly following the procedure. Analysis of PGD2 metabolites in the prediction of systemic adverse reactions during VIT was inadequate (sensitivity 67% and specifi city 0.53%), whilst prediction based on serum tryptase was accurate. Conclusions: In children with severe systemic adverse reactions to Hymenoptera sting, the evaluation of baseline tryptase levels should be a standard procedure. Children with Apis mellifera venom allergy and baseline tryptase levels higher than 7.75 μg/L are at risk of anaphylaxis during buildup. Lower baseline values of plasma and urinary PGD2 metabolite concentration in patients with systemic adverse reaction during VIT suggest that prostaglandin catabolism is altered.© 2011 Esmon Publicidad.","11β-PGF2; 9α; Children; PGD2 metabolites; Rush venom immunotherapy; Serum tryptase; Tetranor-Gd-M",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959383443

Because animals cannot provide subjective reports of how they feel, emotional state can only be inferred using physiological, cognitive, and behavioral measures [4-8]. In humans, negative feelings are reliably correlated with pessimistic cognitive biases, defined as the increased expectation of bad outcomes [9-11]. Recently, mammals [12-16] and birds [17-20] with poor welfare have also been found to display pessimistic-like decision making, but cognitive biases have not thus far been explored in invertebrates. Here, we ask whether honeybees display a pessimistic cognitive bias when they are subjected to an anxiety-like state induced by vigorous shaking designed to simulate a predatory attack. We show for the first time that agitated bees are more likely to classify ambiguous stimuli as predicting punishment. Shaken bees also have lower levels of hemolymph dopamine, octopamine, and serotonin. In demonstrating state-dependent modulation of categorization in bees, and thereby a cognitive component of emotion, we show that the bees' response to a negatively valenced event has more in common with that of vertebrates than previously thought. This finding reinforces the use of cognitive bias as a measure of negative emotional states across species and suggests that honeybees could be regarded as exhibiting emotions.

Corbiculate bees include the highly eusocial honey bees and stingless bees, the primitively eusocial bumble bees, and the predominantly solitary or communal orchid bees. Here we use a model-based approach to reconstruct the evolutionary history of eusociality and date the antiquity of eusocial behavior in apid bees, using a recent molecular phylogeny of the Apidae. We conclude that eusociality evolved once in the common ancestor of the corbiculate Apidae, advanced eusociality evolved independently in the honey and stingless bees, and that eusociality was lost in the orchid bees. Fossil-calibrated divergence time estimates reveal that eusociality first evolved at least 87 Mya (78 to 95 Mya) in the corbiculates, much earlier than in other groups of bees with less complex social behavior. These results provide a robust new evolutionary framework for studies of the organization and genetic basis of social behavior in honey bees and their relatives. © 2011 Cardinal, Danforth.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958764212

Recently, honey bee populations in the United States, Canada, and Europe have suffered an unexplained increase in annual losses due to a phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Epidemiological analysis of CCD is confounded by a relative dearth of bee pathogen field studies. To identify what constitutes an abnormal pathophysiological condition in a honey bee colony, it is critical to have characterized the spectrum of exogenous infectious agents in healthy hives over time. We conducted a prospective study of a large scale migratory bee keeping operation using high-frequency sampling paired with comprehensive molecular detection methods, including a custom microarray, qPCR, and ultra deep sequencing. We established seasonal incidence and abundance of known viruses, Nosema sp., Crithidia mellificae, and bacteria. Ultra deep sequence analysis further identified four novel RNA viruses, two of which were the most abundant observed components of the honey bee microbiome (∼1011 viruses per honey bee). Our results demonstrate episodic viral incidence and distinct pathogen patterns between summer and winter time-points. Peak infection of common honey bee viruses and Nosema occurred in the summer, whereas levels of the trypanosomatid Crithidia mellificae and Lake Sinai virus 2, a novel virus, peaked in January. © 2011 Runckel et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958172988

This study characterized the expression of two genes encoding cuticle proteins sharing the four conserved amino acid blocks of the Tweedle family, AmelTwdl1 and AmelTwdl2, and a gene encoding a cuticle peroxidase containing the Animal haem peroxidase domain, Ampxd, in the honey bee. Gene sequencing and annotation validated the formerly predicted tweedle genes, and revealed a novel gene, Ampxd, in the honey bee genome. Expression of these genes was studied in the context of the ecdysteroid-coordinated pupal-to-adult molt, and in different tissues. Higher transcript levels were detected in the integument after the ecdysteroid peak that induces apolysis, coinciding with the synthesis and deposition of the adult exoskeleton and its early differentiation. The effect of this hormone was confirmed in vivo by tying a ligature between the thorax and abdomen of early pupae to prevent the abdominal integument from coming in contact with ecdysteroids released from the prothoracic gland. This procedure impaired the natural increase in transcript levels in the abdominal integument. Both tweedle genes were expressed at higher levels in the empty gut than in the thoracic integument and trachea of pharate adults. In contrast, Ampxd transcripts were found in higher levels in the thoracic integument and trachea than in the gut. Together, the data strongly suggest that these three genes play roles in ecdysteroid-dependent exoskeleton construction and differentiation and also point to a possible role for the two tweedle genes in the formation of the cuticle (peritrophic membrane) that internally lines the gut. © 2011 Soares et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957794072

Bees have been a model system for sociality and group behavior for decades but only recently have molecular techniques been brought to study this fascinating and valuable organism. With the release of the first draft of its genome in 2006, proteomics of bees became feasible and over the past five years we have amassed in excess of 5E+6 MS/MS spectra. The lack of a consolidated platform to organize this massive resource hampers our ability, and that of others, to mine the information to its maximum potential.Results: Here we introduce the Honey Bee PeptideAtlas, a web-based resource for visualizing mass spectrometry data across experiments, providing protein descriptions and Gene Ontology annotations where possible. We anticipate that this will be helpful in planning proteomics experiments, especially in the selection of transitions for selected reaction monitoring. Through a proteogenomics effort, we have used MS/MS data to anchor the annotation of previously undescribed genes and to re-annotate previous gene models in order to improve the current genome annotation.Conclusions: The Honey Bee PeptideAtlas will contribute to the efficiency of bee proteomics and accelerate our understanding of this species.

In bees they consist of two neuropil regions, each associated with one antenna, delimited by a layer of glial cells and somata of neurons. The neuropil is organized in distinct globular structures of dense synaptic axons coming from the olfactory organs of the antennae, known as glomeruli. In Apis mellifera, as in other eusocial species of bees, queens, workers, and drones perform different functions in the colony and consequently the organs associated with these functions undergo a differential development. In this paper we analyzed the structure and size of the differentiating AL of queens, workers, and drones during metamorphosis using light microscopy. During metamorphosis the neuropil enlarge and differentiates into concentric structures known as glomeruli. The results showed size, structural and temporal differences in the glomeruli development among the classes of individuals of the colony. The neuropil differentiation starts early and is faster in drones and newly emerged worker is the colony individual class with greater neuropil area in AL.

Here, we used the honeybee Apis mellifera and quantified differences in the abundance and activity of sperm proteins sampled either from ejaculates or from the female's sperm storage organ. We find that stored and ejaculated sperm contain the same set of proteins but that the abundance of specific proteins differed substantially between ejaculated and stored sperm. Most proteins with a significant change in abundance are related to sperm energy metabolism. Enzymatic assays performed for a subset of these proteins indicate that specific protein activities differ between stored and ejaculated sperm and are typically higher in ejaculated compared to stored sperm. We provide evidence that the cellular machinery of sperm is plastic and differs between sperm within the ejaculate and within the female's storage organ. Future work will be required to test whether these changes are a consequence of active adaptation or sperm senescence and whether they alter sperm performance in different chemical environments or impact on the cost of sperm storage by the female. However, these changes can be expected to influence sperm performance and therefore determine sperm viability or sperm competitiveness for storage or egg fertilization. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","difference gel electrophoresis; seminal fluid; sperm proteome; sperm senescence",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958861312

We studied the efficiency of reproductive investments (on genetic and energetic levels) of the mother and workers to the next generations. The equalization of fitness of the mother and nurses was achieved by a deliberately induced change in numerically stable sex asymmetry of a bee colony. A swarm was compensated with its energy demand and a volume ratio of distributed genetic information.

In the present study we examine the effects of CO2 (a commonly used anaesthetic in instrumental insemination that causes changes similar to those occurring after mating) and physical manipulation (which may mimic certain aspects of copulation) on the behavioural, physiological and brain transcriptional changes in honey bee queens. We show that while CO2 causes cessation of mating flights and ovary activation, physical manipulation has additional effects on ovary activation and brain transcriptional changes. Comparisons with previous studies of honey bees and female Drosophila indicate that common molecular mechanisms may be responsible for regulating reproductive changes across different mating regimes and insect orders. © 2011 The Authors Insect Molecular Biology © 2011 The Royal Entomological Society.","Carbon dioxide; Honey bee; Mating; Physical manipulation; Reproduction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955727286

While the nest-site selection process in cavity-nesting species such as the European honeybee Apis mellifera is very precise with the swarm carefully selecting a single site, open-nesting species, such as Apis florea, lack such precision. These differences in precision in the nest-site selection process are thought to arise from the differing nest-site requirements of open- and cavity-nesting species. While A. florea can nest on almost any tree, A. mellifera is constrained by the scarcity of suitable nest sites. Here we show that imprecision in the nest-site selection process allows swarms to quickly reach a decision when many nest sites are available. In contrast, a very precise nest-site selection process slows down the decision-making process when nest sites are abundant. Nest-site selection in A. florea appears to be more similar to search-space sampling than to a decision-making process. Bees appear to scout the environment for general areas in which potential nest sites are abundant. Bees involved in searching the environment for suitable nest sites are also involved in guiding the swarm once the decision to depart has been made. Generally A. florea swarms exhibit a lack of consensus in the direction indicated by dancers prior to take-off. Because of this lack of consensus a swarm of A. florea will need to determine its exact direction of travel while in flight. We show that in the absence of directional consensus a swarm of bees can still be guided towards an area containing suitable nest sites provided directional dissent is not too great and nest sites are abundant. However, if the swarm needs to move to a very specific location (a single point in space), directional dissent should be avoided, resulting in a more lengthy decision-making process prior to departure. We further show that the guidance mechanism of bee swarms, so-called 'streaking', functions both when directional dissent is present and when it is absent, making it a more general mechanism of group movement than previously thought. © 2011 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","Apis florea; Decision making; Nest-site selection; Swarm guidance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955465784

Citizen scientists may be able to extend the spatial and temporal extent of pollinator monitoring programs. We developed a citizen-science monitoring protocol in which we trained 13 citizen scientists to observe and classify floral visitors at the resolution of orders or super families (e.g., bee, wasp, fly) and at finer resolution within bees (superfamily Apoidea) only. We evaluated the protocol by comparing data collected simultaneously at 17 sites by citizen scientists (observational data set) and by professionals (specimen-based data set). The sites differed with respect to the presence and age of hedgerows planted to improve habitat quality for pollinators. We found significant, positive correlations among the two data sets for higher level taxonomic composition, honey bee (Apis mellifera) abundance, non-Apis bee abundance, bee richness, and bee community similarity. Results for both data sets also showed similar trends (or lack thereof) in these metrics among sites differing in the presence and age of hedgerows. Nevertheless, citizen scientists did not observe approximately half of the bee groups collected by professional scientists at the same sites. Thus, the utility of citizen-science observational data may be restricted to detection of community-level changes in abundance, richness, or similarity over space and time, and citizen-science observations may not reliably reflect the abundance or frequency of occurrence of specific pollinator species or groups. ©2011 Society for Conservation Biology.","Apoidea; Arthropod; Bee; Ecological monitoring; Floral visitor; Pollinator monitoring; Volunteer observer",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955811302

Honey bees from four of the six colonies collected predominant pollen types (> 45% of a sample). Honey bees from the two colonies which did not collect a predominant pollen type collected two or more secondary pollen types (16-45% of a sample).

We assessed the influence of landscape composition on bee abundance and species richness in apple (Malm spp.) orchards of northeastern Wisconsin during the spring flowering period. A diverse community of bee species occurs in these apple orchards, dominated by wild bees in the families Andrenidae and Halictidae and the honey bee, Apis mellifera L. Proportion of forest area in the surrounding landscape was a significant positive predictor of wild bee abundance in orchards, with strongest effects at a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) buffer distance of 1,000 m or greater. Forest area also was positively associated with species richness, showing strongest effects at a buffer distance of 2,000 m. Nonagricultural developed land (homes, lawns, etcetera) was significantly negatively associated with species richness at buffer distances >750 m and wild bee abundance in bowl traps at all distances. Other landscape variables statistically associated with species richness or abundance of wild bees included proportion area of pasture (positive) and proportion area of roads (negative). Forest area was not associated with honey bee abundance at any buffer distance. These results provide clear evidence that the landscape surrounding apple orchards, especially the proportion of forest area, affects richness and abundance of wild bees during the spring flowering period and should be a part of sustainable land management strategies in agro-ecosystems of northeastern Wisconsin and other apple growing regions. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.","agro-ecosystem; Andrenidae; apple orchards; landscape ecology; Native bees",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958727227

Honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) have historically provided this service, but their recent decline has underscored the need for additional pollinators. The objective of this study was to determine the richness and abundance of native bees in the cranberry-growing area of southern coastal Oregon and compare foraging behaviors of honeybees and native bees. In a 2-year study, we collected over 27 native bee species in traps set out during and after bloom (mid-May to mid-June). During 67 2-min observations, honeybees (68.1%) and three species of bumble bees (Bombus spp.; 31.6%) comprised 99.7% of foragers. The dominant bumble bee was Bombus vosnesenskii Radoszkowski (56.0%). Multivariate regression of temperature and wind speed data indicated that both were significantly predictive of honeybee and bumble bee foragers (P < 0.001). The interquartile range for foraging was 18.3 to 22.2 °C for bumble bees and 21.1 to 26.7°C for honeybees. Over 75% of honeybees were seen foraging above the average observed temperature (19.5°C). Bumble bee pollen loads had a greater dry mass (6.8 ± 12.9 mg) than those of honeybees (2.0 ± 3.6 mg; P < 0.001), and the latter were observed collecting nectar but no pollen more often (during 37.2% of visits) than bumble bees (11.3% of visits). Based on our results, bumble bees in general, and B. vosnesenskii in particular, may be providing significant pollination services for Oregon cranberry farms.

Therefore, we propose the use of behavioral biosensors, in which a whole organism is utilized for the analysis of chemical stimuli. In this case, the organism detects a chemical or physical change and demonstrates this detection through modifications of its behavior; it is the organism's behavior itself that defines the biosensor. In this review, we evaluate the use and future prospects of behavioral biosensors, with a particular focus on parasitic wasps. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Apis mellifera; Behavioral ecology; Multitrophic; Olfactometry; Parasitoid; Volatile organic compounds",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952633684

In general, E. kuehniella eggs proved to be a nutritionally superior food compared to pollen and artificial diet. Pollen supported nymphal development of O. laevigatus better than the artificial diet. Overall, increasing nymphal density resulted in higher mortality, which may be due in part to cannibalism. The addition of a bean pod compensated for the nutritionally suboptimal artificial, but had a negative effect when O. laevigatus was fed on pollen.

We explored whether neuropeptide Y (NPY)-like signalling, a conserved pathway that regulates food-related behaviour, is involved in a derived, nutritionally-related trait, the division of labour in worker honey bees. Transcripts encoding two NPY-like peptides were expressed in separate populations of brain neurosecretory cells, consistent with endocrine functions. NPY-related genes were upregulated in the brains of older foragers compared with younger bees performing brood care ('nurses'). A subset of these changes can be attributed to nutrition, but neuropeptide F peptide treatments did not influence sugar intake. These results contrast with recent reports of more robust associations between division of labour and the related insulin-signalling pathway and suggest that some elements of molecular pathways associated with feeding behaviour may be more evolutionarily labile than others. © 2011 The Authors Insect Molecular Biology © 2011 The Royal Entomological Society.","Apis mellifera; Feeding; npf; snpf",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955718728

Its taxonomy has remained poorly understood because of a lack of modern revisionary work and numerous species described as Tetrapedia whose type specimens have not been re-examined in recent times. Here, a comprehensive study was carried out to review the taxonomy of the genus Paratetrapedia and to investigate cladistically the relationships amongst its species. Eighteen new species of Paratetrapedia are described, giving a total of 32 species in the genus. A phylogenetic analysis of the species of Paratetrapedia was carried out using 61 morphological characters for 41 terminal taxa. The phylogenetic results confirmed the monophyly of Paratetrapedia and allowed the recognition of five species groups: the lugubris, moesta, bicolor, lineata, and flavipennis groups. Nasutopedia gen. nov., recognized as the sister group of Paratetrapedia and with its distribution restricted to the western forested portions of the Andean highlands, is proposed based on distinct morphology, its placement in the phylogenetic tree, and biogeographical patterns. Species of Paratetrapedia are especially diverse in the Amazon Forest; the eastern Brazilian Atlantic Forest contains four endemic species, and one species is endemic to the Cerrado of central Brazil. Paratetrapedia shows a biogeographical pattern similar to other Neotropical groups of bees and birds, with wide distribution and high diversity in lowland forests and whose sister taxon occurs on highlands of north-western portions of the Andean cordillera. Identification keys for males and females of all species are provided, as well as distribution maps and illustrations of general external morphology and genitalia. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London.","Apinae; Neotropical; Oil bees; Tetrapedia",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957587037

Solid particles with systemic insecticide, falling on the vegetation surrounding the sown area, were thought to poison bees foraging on contaminated nectar and pollen. However, bees fed with guttation drops and dew collected from the surrounding vegetation of sown fields showed no acute toxicity. Chemical analysis showed a relatively low content of neonicotinoid in dew and guttation. Thus, the acute poisoning of bees linked to the vegetation contaminated by seed coated fragments containing neonicotinoids was again unproven. For this reason the direct aerial powdering of bees was investigated exposing caged bees around the sown area, not in contact with vegetation. High or low toxicity emerged in different trials. The synergistic effect on bees of high humidity on toxicity of powder containing neonicotinoid was hypothesized. A clear indication that bees were killed by powdering, only if held in high humidity, emerged. Chemical analysis showed high quantities of neonicotinoid insecticide in dead bees earlier exposed to dust in the field.","Apis mellifera; Humidity influence; Neonicotinoids; Seed coating; Toxic powder",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957506671

Some flowers, although exhibiting morphological traits considered best suited for wind pollen dispersal, experience visits of insects. Data on such visits are often not detailed enough to establish if they are occasional or regular events. If visitors are foraging bees, morphological constraints of anemophilous flowers may affect handling ability and foraging effort. We investigated the foraging behaviour of honey bees on Fraxinus ornus L. and Castanea sativa Miller, two species showing a double pollination strategy (wind + insect), but whose flowers retain clear anemophilous characteristics. We recorded honey bee handling time and routines on the flowers of the two tree species providing a comparison when possible. Interestingly, our results confirm the visits to these plants to be regular events. Moreover, on each of them bees express an appropriate collection strategy, adapted to the different spatial organization of the flowers. Two are the implications discussed: on one side, bees can exploit abundant pollen resources, which could increase colony growth and strength, even if the unsuited flower morphology may limit resource collection. On the other, the plants may increase their reproductive success when climatic conditions are unfavourable to wind pollen dispersal.","Castanea sativa miller; Fraxinus ornus l.; Honey bee handling ability; Insect-flower interaction; Wind pollination",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957491841

However, chlorpyrifos is not an ideal treatment because it is highly toxic to birds, fish, aquatic invertebrates, and honeybees. Also, the recommended timing of application conflicts with harvest dates. There is an effective cultural control method, known as mounding, but this method is currently cost prohibitive for commercial production and is not widely used. If mounding could be applied only to infested plants, the cost of this method would be reduced considerably. This study evaluated the potential of acoustics for detecting the larvae in-situ. Human listeners assessed likelihood of arthropod infestation for each site based on live acoustic samples as they were being recorded. Computer software later constructed acoustic indicators from these recordings that were used for computer assessment of infestation likelihood. After recording, the roots of sampled vines were excavated to determine infestation levels. Infestation likelihood predictions of both human listeners and computer software largely reflected infestation condition of tested sites. Consequently, acoustic methods could be developed as tools for growers to employ mounding only at sites most likely to be infested, and thus enable more cost-effective use of this cultural control tactic.","grape pest; IPM; monitoring; mounding; Vitis spp.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960831410

Floral trait distributions of co-flowering species that share pollinators may reflect the impact of pollinator preference and constancy on their assembly within local communities. While pollinator sharing may lead to increased visitation rates for species with similar flowers, the receipt of foreign pollen via interspecific pollinator movements can decrease seed set. We investigated the pattern of community flower colour assembly as perceived by native honeybee pollinators within 24 local assemblages of co-flowering Oxalis species within the Greater Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. To explore the influence of pollinators on trait assembly, we assessed the impact of colour similarity on pollinator choices and the cost of heterospecific pollen receipt. We show that flower colour is significantly clustered within Oxalis communities and that this is not due to historical constraint, as flower colour is evolutionarily labile within Oxalis and communities are randomly structured with respect to phylogeny. Pollinator observations reveal that the likelihood of pollinators switching between co-flowering species is low and increases with flower colour similarity. Interspecific hand pollination significantly reduced seed set in the four Oxalis species we investigated, and all were dependant on pollinators for reproduction. Together these results imply that flower colour similarity carries a potential fitness cost. However, pollinators were highly flower constant, and remained so despite the extreme similarity of flower colour as perceived by honeybees. This suggests that other floral traits facilitate discrimination between similarly coloured species, thereby likely resulting in a low incidence of interspecific pollen transfer (IPT). If colour similarity promotes pollinator attraction at the community level, the observed clustering of flower colour within communities might result from indirect facilitative interactions. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Bee vision; Facilitation; Flower colour; Interspecific pollen transfer; Phylogenetic community structure",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956046913

To fill this gap, the hypothesis that bee visitation to flowers decreases after pollination through reduced floral volatile emissions in highbush blueberries, Vaccinium corymbosum, was tested. Other sources of variation in floral emissions and the role of floral volatiles in bee attraction were also examined. Methods Pollinator visitation to blueberry flowers was manipulated by bagging all flowers within a bush (pollinator excluded) or leaving them unbagged (open pollinated), and then the effect on floral volatile emissions and future bee visitation were measured. Floral volatiles were also measured from different blueberry cultivars, times of the day and flower parts, and a study was conducted to test the attraction of bees to floral volatiles. Key Results Open-pollinated blueberry flowers had 32 lower volatile emissions than pollinator-excluded flowers. In particular, cinnamyl alcohol, a major component of the floral blend that is emitted exclusively from petals, was emitted in lower quantities from open-pollinated flowers. Although, no differences in cinnamyl alcohol emissions were detected among three blueberry cultivars or at different times of day, some components of the blueberry floral blend were emitted in higher amounts from certain cultivars and at mid-day. Field observations showed that more bees visited bushes with pollinator-excluded flowers. Also, more honey bees were caught in traps baited with a synthetic blueberry floral blend than in unbaited traps. Conclusions Greater volatile emissions may help guide bees to unpollinated flowers, and thus increase plant fitness and bee energetic return when foraging in blueberries. Furthermore, the variation in volatile emissions from blueberry flowers depending on pollination status, plant cultivar and time of day suggests an adaptive role of floral signals in increasing pollination of flowers. © The Author 2011.

In the present study, guttation drops of corn plants obtained from commercial seeds coated with thiamethoxam, clothianidin, imidacloprid and fipronil have been analyzed by an optimized fast UHPLC-DAD procedure showing excellent detection limits and accuracy, both adequate for the purpose. The young plants grown both in pots - in greenhouse - and in open field from coated seeds, produced guttation solutions containing high levels of the neonicotinoid insecticides (up to 346 mg L-1 for imidacloprid, 102 mg L-1 for clothianidin and 146 mg L-1 for thiamethoxam). These concentration levels may represent lethal doses for bees that use guttation drops as a source of water. The neonicotinoid concentrations in guttation drops progressively decrease during the first 10-15 days after the emergence of the plant from the soil. Otherwise fipronil, which is a non-systemic phenylpyrazole insecticide, was never detected into guttation drops.

Because propolis possesses an immunomodulatory action on mammals, the objective of our study was to investigate the effects of propolis on the humoral immune response of laying hens by evaluating antibody production. Laying hens (ISA Brown) were divided into 5 groups with 7 birds each. Group 1 was a nonimmunized control, whereas birds in group 2 were immunized intravenously with SRBC, and those in groups 3, 4, and 5 were treated intraperitoneally with propolis (2, 10, and 50 mg/kg, respectively) on 3 consecutive days and then inoculated intravenously with SRBC. Hematological and serological analyses were carried out on d 0, 3, and 38. Natural and specific antibody levels were determined by hemagglutination with rabbit red blood cells and SRBC, respectively. Propolis-treated birds (50 mg/kg) showed a significant decline in heterophils and in the heterophil:lymphocyte ratio. After SRBC immunization, significant increases in levels of IgG were observed in groups 4 and 5. Furthermore, higher levels of natural antibodies were observed in propolis-treated laying hens. The administration of propolis to laying hens increased the production of IgG specific to SRBC and natural antibodies, and could be used to increase antigen-specific antibody responses to vaccines. © 2011 Poultry Science Association Inc.","Antibody; Humoral immune response; Laying hen; Propolis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957533948

Such diagnoses can be compromised by ubiquitous and endogenous RNA-degrading enzymes activated after the death of sampled bees. RNA degradation can be minimized by storage at ultra-cold temperatures or by immersion in high-salt buffers. However, these methods are not always available in the field or are costly, driving a search for alternative methods to store and transport bees for RNA analyses. While the impact of storage conditions on RNA integrity has been evaluated, the tolerance of standard RT-qPCR diagnostic methods of honey bee pathogens for suboptimal collection and storage is unknown. Given the short regions of RNA used for pathogen diagnosis (generally amplified regions of 100-200 nucleotides), it is conceivable that even degraded RNA will provide a template for precise diagnosis. In this study, the impact of the two most convenient sample storage and handling methods (+4 °C and ambient temperature) for identifying honey bee virus infections was evaluated by RT-qPCR. The aim was to streamline the methods needed to collect, transport, and store honey bee samples destined for pathogen diagnosis. The data show that samples held at room temperature for times anticipated for sample transport for up to 5 days are suitable for diagnosis of two of the most common and prevalent honey bee viruses, deformed wing virus (DWV) and black queen cell virus (BQCV).

The structure of such interaction webs holds information about specialization and effectiveness of flower visitors in flower resource use. Here, we analyzed 52 plant-flower visitor interaction webs along a gradient of experimentally manipulated plant species richness in a European grassland. The gradient allows testing for effects of the number of flowering plant species per se. Linkage density and interaction diversity between flowering plant species and their visiting insect species increased with higher richness of flowering species. Increased interaction diversity led to smaller temporal variability in the frequency of flower visits. These results suggest higher temporal stability of pollination provided for plants integrated in complex interaction webs with a high number of flowering plant species.Flower resource specialization of solitary bees, but not of honey and bumble bees, increased with increasing flowering plant species richness.

Under voltage-clamp, tetramethrin and permethrin induce a long lasting TTX-sensitive tail current upon repolarization, which is the hallmark of an abnormal prolongation of the open channel configuration. Permethrin and tetramethrin also slow down the sodium current fast inactivation. Tetramethrin and permethrin both bind to the closed state of the channel as suggested by the presence of an obvious tail current after the first single depolarization applied in the presence of either compounds. Moreover, at first sight, channel opening seems to promote tetramethrin and permethrin binding as evidenced by the progressive tail current summation along with trains of stimulations, tetramethrin being more potent at modifying channels than permethrin. However, a use-dependent increase in the sodium peak current along with stimulations suggests that the tail current accumulation could also be a consequence of progressively unmasked silent channels. Experiments with the sea anemone toxin ATX-II that suppresses sodium channels fast inactivation are consistent with the hypothesis that these silent channels are either in an inactivated state at rest, or that they normally inactivate before they open so that they do not participate to the control sodium current. In honeybee ORNs, three processes lead to a use-dependent pyrethroid-induced tail current accumulation: (i) a recruitment of silent channels that produces an increase in the peak sodium current, (ii) a slowing down of the sodium current inactivation produced by prolongation of channels opening and (iii) a typical deceleration in current deactivation. The use-dependent recruitment of silent sodium channels in honeybee ORNs makes pyrethroids more potent at modifying neuronal excitability. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Antennal sensilla; Bee health; Electrophysiology; Insecticide; Ionic current; Mode of action; Olfactory receptor neurons; Para; Patch-clamp; Permethrin; Sensory neuron; Sodium channel; State-dependent modification; Tetramethrin; TipE",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953063187

However, the molecular mechanism that regulates honeybee pupae head metamorphosis is still poorly understood. To further our understand of the associated molecular mechanism, we investigated the protein change of the honeybee pupae head at 5 time-points using 2-D electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, bioinformatics, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Accordingly, 58 protein spots altered their expression across the 5 time points (13-20 days), of which 36 proteins involved in the head organogenesis were upregulated during early stages (13-17 days). However, 22 proteins involved in regulating the pupae head neuron and gland development were upregulated at later developmental stages (19-20 days). Also, the functional enrichment analysis further suggests that proteins related to carbohydrate metabolism and energy production, development, cytoskeleton and protein folding were highly involved in the generation of organs and development of honeybee pupal head. Furthermore, the constructed protein interaction network predicted 33 proteins acting as key nodes of honeybee pupae head growth of which 9 and 4 proteins were validated at gene and protein levels, respectively. In this study, we uncovered potential protein species involved in the formation of honeybee pupae head development along with their specific temporal requirements. This first proteomic result allows deeper understanding of the proteome profile changes during honeybee pupae head development and provides important potential candidate proteins for future reverse genetic research on honeybee pupae head development to improve the performance of related organs. © 2011 Zheng et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957576756

Nevertheless, it is necessary to monitor the mite IR over longer periods of time to detect the most resistant hives and avoid future problems.","Africanized apis mellifera; Apidae; Bee pathology; Parasitology; Social insects; Varroidae",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957485761

The heritability estimates in unicharacter analysis ranged from 0.01 to 0.08, and for thricharacter from 0.004 to 0.01. The genetic correlation values were positive for royal jelly production per colony and per cup (0.29), for larvae acceptance and royal jelly production per colony (0.42), and for larvae acceptance and royal jelly production per cup (0.06). The royal jelly production had environmental influence. The genetic correlation indicates that selection to increase royal jelly production per colony will increase larvae acceptance and royal jelly production per cup.","Apis mellifera; Bayesian inference; Genetic evaluation; Heritability; Honeybee breeding",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957469322

This dimorphism depends not on genetic differences, but on ingestion of royal jelly, although the mechanism through which royal jelly regulates caste differentiation has long remained unknown. Here I show that a 57-kDa protein in royal jelly, previously designated as royalactin, induces the differentiation of honeybee larvae into queens. Royalactin increased body size and ovary development and shortened developmental time in honeybees. Surprisingly, it also showed similar effects in the fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster). Mechanistic studies revealed that royalactin activated p70 S6 kinase, which was responsible for the increase of body size, increased the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase, which was involved in the decreased developmental time, and increased the titre of juvenile hormone, an essential hormone for ovary development. Knockdown of epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) expression in the fat body of honeybees and fruitflies resulted in a defect of all phenotypes induced by royalactin, showing that Egfr mediates these actions. These findings indicate that a specific factor in royal jelly, royalactin, drives queen development through an Egfr-mediated signalling pathway. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Pollen viability and stigma receptivity are temporally isolated; stigma is receptive on the third day and pollen viability is highest (75%) on the day of anthesis. Field observations confirmed that the flowers offer both pollen and nectar to the visitors. The visitors include honey bees and butterflies, but the former served as better pollinators. Manual pollinations revealed that the species permits both geitonogamous and xenogamous pollination. The fruit set rate in natural pollination is low (38%), but manual xenogamous pollination enhanced the fruit set up to 65%. Its dependence on specialized habitats, fragmentation of populations, narrow environmental niche, scarcity of pollinators, delayed stigma receptivity and low percentage of seed germination could be the reasons for its limited distribution and endangerment in the Western Ghats.","Critically endangered; Impatiens platyadena; Narrow distribution; Reproductive ecology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958803277

Some honeybee species engage in visually apparent behavior, walking in a figure-eight pattern inside their dark hives. It has been suggested that sounds play an important role in this dance language, even though a variety of wing vibration sounds are produced by honeybee behaviors in hives. It has been shown that dances emit sounds primarily at about 250-300 Hz, which is in the same frequency range as honeybees' flight sounds. Thus the exact mechanism whereby honeybees attract nestmates using waggle dances in such a dark and noisy hive is as yet unclear. In this study, we used a flight simulator in which honeybees were attached to a torque meter in order to analyze the component of bees' orienting response caused only by sounds, and not by odor or by vibrations sensed by their legs. We showed using single sound localization that honeybees preferred sounds around 265 Hz. Furthermore, according to sound discrimination tests using sounds of the same frequency, honeybees preferred rhythmic sounds. Our results demonstrate that frequency and rhythmic components play a complementary role in localizing dance sounds. Dance sounds were presumably developed to share information in a dark and noisy environment. © 2011 Hasegawa, Ikeno.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956072022

In order to investigate the capacity of the honeybees' homing abilities, we artificially displaced foragers to novel release spots at various distances up to 13 km in the four cardinal directions. Returning bees were individually registered by a radio frequency identification (RFID) system at the hive entrance. We found that homing rate, homing speed and the maximum homing distance depend on the release direction. Bees released in the east were more likely to find their way back home, and returned faster than bees released in any other direction, due to the familiarity of global landmarks seen from the hive.

Here we investigated lateralization of odour detection and learning in the bumble bee, Bombus terrestris L., an annual eusocial species of Hymenoptera. By training bumble bees on the proboscis extension reflex paradigm with only one antenna in use, we provided the very first evidence of asymmetrical performance favouring the right antenna in responding to learned odours in this species. Electroantennographic responses did not reveal significant antennal asymmetries in odour detection, whereas morphological counting of olfactory sensilla showed a predominance in the number of olfactory sensilla trichodea type A in the right antenna.

The antioxidant properties of propolis, a hive product collected by honey bees mainly from poplar bud exudates, suggest that poplar buds also possess antioxidant properties. Here is reported the characterization of the antioxidant properties of an aqueous poplar bud (Populus nigra) extract. It presented a high total phenolic content, and moderate antioxidant properties as determined by ORAC assay. The main phenolic compounds identified were phenolic acids and flavonoid aglycons. These phenolic compounds were analyzed by ORAC assay for their individual antioxidant activity, in order to determine the major contributors to the total antioxidant activity of the extract. Thanks to their high antioxidant activity, caffeic and p-coumaric acids were identified as the major antioxidant components. Representing only 3.5% of its dry weight, these compounds represented together about 50% of the total antioxidant activity of the extract. The antioxidant properties of poplar bud extract and the phenolic compounds identified were also analyzed by cellular antioxidant activity assay (CAA), which was weakly correlated with ORAC assay. The transcriptional effect of poplar bud extract on skin aging was evaluated in vitro on a replicative senescence model of normal human dermal fibroblasts, using a customized DNA macroarray specifically designed to investigate skin aging markers.

DNA methylation has been shown to play an important role in this differentiation. In this study, we examine the contributions of diet and cell size to caste differentiation. Methodology/Principal Findings: We measured the activity and gene expression of one key enzyme involved in methylation, Dnmt3; the rates of methylation in the gene dynactin p62; as well as morphological characteristics of adult bees developed either from larvae fed with worker jelly or royal jelly; and larvae raised in either queen or worker cells. We show that both diet type and cell size contributed to the queen-worker differentiation, and that the two factors affected different methylation sites inside the same gene dynactin p62. Conclusions/Significance: We confirm previous findings that Dnmt3 plays a critical role in honey bee caste differentiation. Further, we show for the first time that cell size also plays a role in influencing larval development when diet is kept the same. © 2011 Shi et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955580408

Biomineralization of superparamagnetic magnetite occurs in the iron deposition vesicles of trophocytes. Even though magnetite has been demonstrated, the mechanism of magnetite biomineralization is unknown. In this study, proteins in the iron granules and iron deposition vesicles of trophocytes were purified and identified by mass spectrometry. Antibodies against such proteins were produced. The major proteins include actin, myosin, ferritin 2, and ATP synthase. Immunolabeling and co-immunoprecipitation studies suggest that iron is stored in ferritin 2 for the purpose of forming 7.5-nm diameter iron particles and that actin-myosin-ferritin 2 may serve as a transporter system. This system, along with calcium and ATP, conveys the iron particles (ferritin) to the center of iron deposition vesicles for iron granules formation. These proteins and reactants are included in iron deposition vesicles during the formation of iron deposition vesicles from the fusion of smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

We previously used a novel immediate early gene, termed kakusei, to demonstrate that the neural activity of a specific mushroom body (MB) neuron subtype is preferentially enhanced in the forager brain. The sensory information related to this MB neuron activity, however, remained unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we used kakusei to analyze the relationship between MB neuron activity and types of foraging behavior. The number of kakusei-positive MB neurons was higher in the round dancers that had flown a short distance than in the waggle dancers that had flown a long distance. Furthermore, the amount of kakusei transcript in the MBs inversely related to the waggle-phase duration of the waggle dance, which correlates with the flight distance. Using a narrow tunnel whose inside was vertically or axially lined, we manipulated the pattern of visual input, which is received by the foragers during flight, and analysed kakusei expression. The amount of kakusei transcript in the MBs was related to the foraging frequency but not to the tunnel pattern. In contrast, the number of kakusei-positive MB neurons was affected by the tunnel patterns, but not related to foraging frequency. Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that the MB neuron activity depends on the foraging frequency, whereas the number of active MB neurons is related to the pattern of visual input received during foraging flight.

Despite this convergence, there are striking differences among eusocial lifestyles, ranging from species living in small colonies with overt conflict over reproduction to species in which colonies contain hundreds of thousands of highly specialized sterile workers produced by one or a few queens. Although the evolution of eusociality has been intensively studied, the genetic changes involved in the evolution of eusociality are relatively unknown. We examined patterns of molecular evolution across three independent origins of eusociality by sequencing transcriptomes of nine socially diverse bee species and combining these data with genome sequence from the honey bee Apis mellifera to generate orthologous sequence alignments for 3,647 genes. We found a shared set of 212 genes with a molecular signature of accelerated evolution across all eusocial lineages studied, as well as unique sets of 173 and 218 genes with a signature of accelerated evolution specific to either highly or primitively eusocial lineages, respectively. These results demonstrate that convergent evolution can involve a mosaic pattern of molecular changes in both shared and lineage-specific sets of genes. Genes involved in signal transduction, gland development, and carbohydrate metabolism are among the most prominent rapidly evolving genes in eusocial lineages. These findings provide a starting point for linking specific genetic changes to the evolution of eusociality.","Molecular phylogenetics; Social evolution; Social insects; Sociogenomics",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956306832

Although worker-queen interactions have been studied in detail, worker-drone interactions are less well understood. We investigated caste interactions in honey bees by determining the age and behavior of workers that perform vibration signals, trophallaxis, and grooming with drones. Workers of all ages could engage in the different interactions monitored, although workers that performed vibration signals on drones were significantly older than those engaging in trophallaxis and grooming. Only 3-8% of workers engaged in the different behaviors were monitored. Compared with workers that performed vibration signals only on workers ('worker vibrators'), those that performed signals on both workers and drones ('drone vibrators') had greater movement rates inside the nest, higher vibration signaling rates, and were more likely to have an immediate association with foraging. Both worker vibrators and drone vibrators contacted drones of all ages as they moved through the nest. However, drone vibrators contacted drones at higher rates, contacted slightly, but significantly younger drones, and were more likely to engage in trophallaxis and grooming with drones, in addition to vibrating them. Taken together, our results suggest that tiny proportions of workers belonging to separate, but overlapping age groups provide most of the care received by adult drones, and that drone vibrators comprise a subset of signalers within a colony that have an increased tendency to contact and interact with drones. Vibratory, tactile signals are involved in colony reproductive and movement decisions in a number of species of bees, wasps and ants, and may provide valuable tools for investigating caste interactions in many insect societies. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953713654

Recent studies have demonstrated that increased genetic diversity within a honeybee colony increases the variation in the frequency of tasks performed by workers. We show that genotypically diverse colonies, each composed of 20 subfamilies, collect more pollen than do genotypically similar colonies, each composed of a single subfamily. However, genotypically similar colonies collect greater varieties of pollen than do genotypically diverse colonies. Further, the composition of collected pollen types is less similar among genotypically similar colonies than among genotypically diverse colonies. The response threshold model predicts that genotypic subsets of workers vary in their response to task stimuli. Consistent with this model, our findings suggest that genotypically diverse colonies likely send out fewer numbers of foragers that independently search for pollen sources (scouts) in response to protein demand by the colony, resulting in a lower variety of collected pollen types. The cooperative foraging strategy of honeybees involves a limited number of scouts monitoring the environment that then guide the majority of foragers to high quality food sources. The genetic composition of the colony appears to play an important role in the efficiency of this behavior. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Genetic influence on pollen foraging; Intracolonial genetic diversity; Polyandry",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955031830

Nosema ceranae is a highly prevalent worldwide pathogen for honey bees that has been related to colony losses. A commercial formulation that contains fumagillin dicyclohexylamine, Fumidil B ®, can control N. ceranae infection. However, the effectiveness of Fumidil B ® is affected by several factors, such as storage, treatment preparation, the quantity consumed by bees etc. Indeed, UV exposure (e.g. sunlight) drastically reduces the initial concentration of fumagillin within a few hours, while temperature affects its degradation. Although laboratory tests suggest that a semisolid mixture of honey and powdered sugar is the best option to apply fumagillin, its application in syrup (250 mL per dosage) is more effective for the treatment of infected colonies. The total amount of syrup containing fumagillin ingested by honey bees is a key factor in its efficacy, and it has been found that medicated patties were not fully consumed in field trials. In honey bee colonies, the dose of 120 mg/honey bee colony at the recommended posology is effective against depopulation and colony death due to N. ceranae after 1 year, without residues being detected in honey, although reinfection could be detected 4 months after treatment ended. © INRA, DIB-AGIB and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., 2011.","Colony depopulation; Dosage; Fumagillin; Honey-sugar patty; Nosema ceranae; Stability; Syrup; Treatment",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054681967

A. florea differs from the well-studied Western Hive bee (Apis mellifera) in that it nests in the open rather than in cavities. This fundamental difference in nesting biology is likely to have implications for nest-site selection, the process by which a reproductive swarm selects a new site to live in. In A. mellifera, workers show a series of characteristic behaviors that allow the swarm to select the best nest site possible. Here, we describe the behavior of individual A. florea workers during the process of nest-site selection and show that it differs from that seen in A. mellifera. We analyzed a total of 1,459 waggle dances performed by 197 scouts in five separate swarms. Our results suggest that two fundamental aspects of the behavior of A. mellifera scouts-the process of dance decay and the process of repeated nest site evaluation-do not occur in A. florea. We also found that the piping signal used by A. mellifera scouts to signal that a quorum has been reached at the chosen site, is performed by both dancing and non-dancing bees in A. florea. Thus, the piping signal appears to serve a different purpose in A. florea. Our results illustrate how differences in nesting biology affect the behavior of individual bees during the nest-site selection process. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Apis florea; Group decision-making; Nest-site selection; Swarming",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955008752

The effect of trap colour on the species and numbers caught has been studied in the Northern Hemisphere, but not in the Australian region. Australia has a unique bee fauna and colour preferences, if any, may differ from those found in other continents. In four separate surveys across a wide area of New South Wales, it was tested whether there was a difference in the abundance or species richness captured by yellow- and white-coloured pan traps. In total, 1267 bees were collected, comprising 66 species, 50 of which are in the family Halictidae. In all surveys, yellow pan traps collected a significantly larger number and greater diversity of bees. Eight of the thirteen most common species were observed significantly more frequently (P<0.01) in yellow pan traps, while the European honey bee (Apis mellifera) was found in larger numbers in white traps. Our results demonstrate that differently coloured traps collect different components of the Australian bee fauna.

Many insects transcribe ILPs in specialized neurosecretory cells at changing levels correlated with life history. However, the major site of insect metabolism and nutrient storage is not the brain, but rather the fat body, where functions of ILP expression are rarely studied and poorly understood. Fat body is analogous to mammalian liver and adipose tissue, with nutrient stores that often correlate with behavior. We used the honey bee (Apis mellifera), an insect with complex behavior, to test whether ILP genes in fat body respond to experimentally induced changes of behavioral physiology. Honey bee fat body influences endocrine state and behavior by secreting the yolk protein precursor vitellogenin (Vg), which suppresses lipophilic juvenile hormone and social foraging behavior. In a two-factorial experiment, we used RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated vg gene knockdown and amino acid nutrient enrichment of hemolymph (blood) to perturb this regulatory module. We document factorspecific changes in fat body ilp1 and ilp2 mRNA, the bee's ILP-encoding genes, and confirm that our protocol affects social behavior. We show that ilp1 and ilp2 are regulated independently and differently and diverge in their specific expressionlocalization between fat body oenocyte and trophocyte cells. Insect ilp functions may be better understood by broadening research to account for expression in fat body and not only brain. © 2011.

The small hive beetle, Aethina tumida Murray (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), and the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman are honey bee parasites and both overwinter in host colonies. The efficiency of thermoregulation might thus be affected in infested host winter clusters, due to altered worker activity. Here, we show for the first time that parasites can alter honey bee thermoregulation. Moreover, the data suggest that only combined infestations with V. destructor and A. tumida result in higher thermal maxima in the winter clusters, whereas infestations with one parasite alone had no significant effect compared with the controls. Due to the ubiquitous mite V. destructor combined infestations with parasites or combined infections with pathogens are almost inevitable. Therefore, our data indicate that an altered thermoregulation due to multiple infestations might be another widespread factor contributing to winter losses of honey bee colonies. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.","Aethina tumida; Apis mellifera; thermoregulation; Varroa destructor; winter cluster",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955977891

The causative agent is the Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium Paenibacillus larvae. Several authors have proposed that P. larvae secretes metalloproteases that are involved in the larval degradation that occurs after infection. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the production of a metalloprotease by P. larvae during larval infection. First, the complete gene encoding a metalloprotease was identified in the P. larvae genome and its distribution was evaluated by PCR in a collection of P. larvae isolates from different geographical regions. Then, the complete gene was amplified, cloned and overexpressed, and the recombinant metalloprotease was purified and used to generate anti-metalloprotease antibodies. Metalloprotease production was evaluated by immunofluorescence and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The gene encoding a P. larvae metalloprotease was widely distributed in isolates from different geographical origins in Uruguay and Argentina. Metalloprotease was detected inside P. larvae vegetative cells, on the surface of P. larvae spores and secreted to the external growth medium. Its production was also confirmed in vivo, during the infection of honeybee larvae. This protein was able to hydrolyse milk proteins as described for P. larvae, suggesting that could be involved in larval degradation. This work contributes to the knowledge of the pathogenicity mechanisms of a bacterium of great economic significance and is one step in the characterization of potential P. larvae virulence factors. © 2011 SGM Printed in Great Britain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955754048

In honeybees, Apis mellifera, foragers can follow waggle dances (social information) to obtain vector information about the location of profitable food sources or they can use route memories (private information) acquired during previous foraging trips. The relative use of social information versus private information is poorly understood and currently debated. It is hypothesized that social information should be prioritized when the use of private information has a low benefit. We tested this hypothesis by training foragers to a high-quality 2. M sucrose feeder, which subsequently became unrewarding. As foragers continued to experience zero reward from their private route information they increased the time spent following waggle dances advertising an alternative food source with the same odour. A significant proportion of foragers successfully switched to the food source indicated by dances. Overall, trained foragers showed a strong attachment to the known but currently unrewarding feeder, even after repeatedly following dances advertising a profitable alternative. Successful recruits to the novel food source advertised by the waggle dances had more social information about this source in that they had followed dances for longer. Our results suggest that honeybee foragers follow a strategy that is conservative in terms of switching from one food patch to another. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Apis mellifera; Communication; Honeybee; Private information; Route memory; Social information; Waggle dance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953305416

The honeybee readily inhabits all environmental compartments, such as soil, vegetation, air, and water, and actively forages the area around the hive. Therefore, if it functions in a polluted environment, plant products used by bees may also be contaminated, and as a result, also a part of these pollutants will accumulate in the organism. The bees, foragers in particular, are good biological indicators that quickly detect the chemical impairment of the environment by the high mortality and the presence of pollutants in their body or in beehive products. The experiment was carried out using 24 colonies of honeybees bred in hives dislocated whether within urban areas or in wide countryside areas. Metals were analyzed on the foragers during all spring and summer seasons, when the bees were active. Results showed no presence of mercury in all samples analyzed, but honeybees accumulated several amounts of lead, chromium, and cadmium. Pb reported a statistically significant difference among the stations located in urban areas and those in the natural reserves, showing the highest values in honeybees collected from hives located in Ciampino area (Rome), next to the airport.

In addition to this hypersensitivity, an anaphylactoid reaction occurs by toxic effects even in a non-allergic person via cytolysis followed by similar clinical manifestations. Auto-injectable epinephrine might be effective for bee stings, but cannot inhibit mast cell lysis and degranulation by venom toxins. We used connective tissue type canine mast cell line (CM-MC) for finding an effective measure that might inhibit bee venom toxicity. We evaluated degranulation and cytotoxicity by measurement of β-hexosaminidase release and MTT assay. Melittin and crude bee venom induced the degranulation and cytotoxicity, which were strongly inhibited by mono-sialoganglioside (G M1), di-sialoganglioside (G D1a) and tri-sialoganglioside (G T1b). In contrast, honeybee venom-derived phospholipase A 2 induced the net degranulation directly without cytotoxicity, which was not inhibited by G M1, G D1a and G T1b. For analysis of distribution of Gα q and Gα i protein by western blotting, lipid rafts were isolated by using discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifuge. Melittin disrupted the localization of Gα q and Gα i at lipid raft, but gangliosides stabilized the rafts. As a result from this cell-based study, bee venom-induced anaphylactoid reaction can be explained with melittin cytotoxicity and phospholipase A 2-induced degranulation. Taken together, gangliosides inhibit the effect of melittin such as degranulation, cytotoxicity and lipid raft disruption but not phospholipase A 2-induced degranulation in mast cells. Our study shows a potential of gangliosides as a therapeutic tool for anaphylactoid reaction by honeybee sting. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Ganglioside; Honeybee venom; Lipid raft; Mast cells; Melittin; Phospholipase A 2",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954631271

While pollen production has obvious benefits for plant male fitness, its consequences for plant female fitness, especially in self-incompatible hermaphrodite species, are less certain. Pollen production could either enhance seed production though increased pollinator attraction, or reduce it if ovules are discounted by deposition of self pollen, as can occur in species with late-acting self-incompatibility. To test the effects of pollen reward provision on female fitness, we artificially emasculated flowers in two populations of the succulent Aloe maculata (Asphodelaceae), which has a late-acting self-incompatibility system, over the course of its flowering period. Flowers of this species are visited by sunbirds (for nectar) and native bees (for pollen and nectar). We measured floral visitation rates, floral rejection rates, pollen deposition on stigmas and fruit and seed set in both emasculated and non-emasculated plants. We found that flowers of emasculated plants suffered reduced visitation and increased rejection (arrival without visitation) by bees, but not by sunbirds; had fewer pollen grains deposited on stigmas and showed an overall decrease in fruit set and seed set. Rates of seed abortion were, however, greatly reduced in emasculated flowers. This study shows that pollen rewards can be important for seed set, even in self-incompatible plants, which have been assumed to rely on nectar rewards for pollinator attraction. Seed abortion was, however, increased by pollen production, a result that highlights the complexity of selection on pollen production in hermaphrodite flowers. © 2011 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","Aloe; Apis mellifera; Gender conflict; Late-acting self-incompatibility; Ovule discounting; Pollen theft; Sunbirds",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954514064

This competition can be very intense when workers can reproduce using thelytoky as worker lineages that manage to produce new queens gain a huge benefit. Selection at the individual level might then lead to the evolution of cheating genotypes, i.e. genotypes that reproduce more than their fair share. We studied the variation in reproductive success among worker patrilines in the thelytokous and highly polyandrous ant Cataglyphis cursor. Workers produce new queens by thelytoky in orphaned colonies. The reproductive success of each patriline was assessed in 13 orphaned colonies using genetic analysis of 433 workers and 326 worker-produced queens. Our results show that patrilines contributed unequally to queen production in half of the colonies, and the success of patrilines was function of their frequencies in workers. However, over all colonies, we observed a significant difference in the distribution of patrilines between workers and worker-produced queens, and this difference was significant in three of 13 colonies. In addition, six colonies contained a low percentage of foreign workers (drifters), and in one colony, they produced a disproportionably high number of queens. Hence, we found some evidence for the occurrence of rare cheating genotypes. Nevertheless, cheating appears to be less pronounced than in the Cape Honey bee, a species with a similar reproductive system. We argue that worker reproduction by parthenogenesis might not be common in natural populations of C. cursor. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","parthenogenesis; polyandry; social conflict; social insects; worker reproduction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954657388

The present investigation was carried out in Panchkula district of Haryana state in India and respondents included a group of 30 beekeepers who were still in the occupation of beekeeping and another group 30 beekeepers comprised of respondents who had left the occupation of beekeeping for one or the other reason. A pre-tested interview schedule was used to delineate the ecological factors affecting beekeepers for continuing in the occupation and to assess the constraints faced by them. The results revealed that the respondents, who were young, educated and had more exposure to mass media continued with the profession. It was also revealed that respondents from joint families or with more members continued with the profession since the venture seemed more profitable because of saving of expenditure for hiring labour from outside. Further, the respondents who adopted beekeeping as a subsidiary occupation, at least in the beginning, were more successful as they had the capacity to offset the losses, if any, during the initial phase. The major constraints listed by the respondents during the survey were honeybee pests and diseases, shortage of bee forage necessitating migration to areas where bee forage was available, credit facility for starting the vocation and to offset the losses due to pests and diseases, management of bee colonies in extreme weather conditions, pesticide poisoning and lack of subsidiary occupation as in other developing countries. Lack of cooperatives and institutional support for marketing, lack of motivation, lack of skilled manpower and training institutions were other constraints felt by few beekeepers.","Apiculture; Honeybees",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955977871

ABC tries to simulate the intelligent behavior of real honey bees in food foraging and can be used for solving continuous optimization and multi-dimensional numeric problems. This paper introduces the Artificial Bee Colony with Random Keys (ABCRK), a modified ABC algorithm for solving combinatorial problems such as the In-Core Fuel Management Optimization (ICFMO). The ICFMO is a hard combinatorial optimization problem in Nuclear Engineering which during many years has been solved by expert knowledge. It aims at getting the best arrangement of fuel in the nuclear reactor core that leads to a maximization of the operating time. As a consequence, the operation cost decreases and money is saved. In this study, ABCRK is used for optimizing the ICFMO problem of a Brazilian ""2-loop"" Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) and the results obtained with the proposed algorithm are compared with those obtained by Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The results show that the performance of the ABCRK algorithm is better than or similar to that of other population-based algorithms, with the advantage of employing fewer control parameters.","Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm; Combinatorial optimization; In-Core Fuel Management Optimization; Random Keys; Swarm intelligence",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952449477

Fructose, glucose and maltose are among the various types of sugars present in honey. Used for millennia as both food and medicine, honey has been associated with improved antioxidant capacity, modulation of the immune system, antimicrobial activities, influence on lipid values (through antihypercholesterolemic effects) and regulation of glycemic responses, among other benefits. The aim of this article was to review the effects of natural honey intake on human health, with particular reference to its influence on glycemic regulation. Several studies have focused on the potential use of honey as a nutritional supplement for healthy individuals and for those with impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, and their related comorbidities. Such investigations have found that, compared to glucose and sucrose, the consumption of honey decreases glycemic levels and blood lipids in healthy, diabetic and hyperlipidemic individuals. Moreover, long periods of honey intake seem to reduce fasting glucose levels in humans, suggesting that honey consumption influences plasma glucose regulation, mainly through a normo-or hypoglycemic effect. Therefore, honey may be proposed as a nutritional dietary supplement for healthy individuals and for those suffering from alterations in glycemic regulation.","Diabetes; Flavonoids; Glycemic regulation; Honey; Insulin resistance; Nutraceuticals; Nutrition",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052739723

Plants may experience conflicting selection on floral traits by different pollinators and between genders. Using artificial selection to increase phenotypic variation, we tested for conflicting and nonadditive selection on wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) flowers. To do this, we measured selection by each of the major pollinator taxa through both male and female fitness, and tested for a single-generation response to selection by a subset of these pollinators. We found some evidence for conflicting selection on anther exsertion--sweat bees exerted stabilizing selection and larger bees selected for increased exsertion. Stamen dimorphism was only under selection by honey bees, causing a response to selection in the next generation, and flower size was under similar selection by multiple pollinators. Selection differed significantly between genders for two traits, but there was no evidence for stronger selection through male fitness or for conflicting selection between genders. Our results suggest wild radish flowers can adapt to multiple pollinators, as we found little evidence for conflicting selection and no evidence for nonadditive selection among pollinators. © 2011 The Author(s).

In the laboratory, eggs, larvae, and adults of SHB were treated with thymol (10, 20, and 50 mg) or with organic acids: 85% formic acid (0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1.0, and 2.0 mL), 15% lactic acid (0. 5, 1. 0, 1.5, and 2.0 mL), oxalic acid (dihydrate crystals 35 g/L; 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1.0, and 2.0 mL), and 65% acetic acid (0. 5, 1. 0, 1.5, and 2.0 mL). Some of the chosen concentrations of formic and oxalic acid resulted in high mortalities of all SHB life stages. Therefore, they were further evaluated in the field utilising standard methods for control of V. destructor in Europe. After exposure to evaporating formic acid (85%, Nassenheider®) and oxalic acid (2 g dehydrate crystals, Varrox®), mortality in all SHB tested stages did not increase significantly. The same was true for trials with 85% (adults) or 60% (eggs and larvae) formic acid, evaporating from sponge tissues in diagnostic trays. In fact, some SHBs used the diagnostic trays to hide or oviposit. Despite treating extracted honey combs with 65% acetic acid, SHBs still reproduced on the combs' pollen cells. In conclusion, none of the tested methods can be recommended to control SHBs. © INRA, DIB-AGIB and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., 2011.","Apis mellifera; Formic acid; Lactic acid; Oxalic acid; Pest management; Small hive beetle",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054690016

Pollen hoarding (pln) in honeybees is a complex trait associated with a well-characterized suite of linked behavioral and physiological traits. In European honeybee stocks bidirectionally selected for pln, worker (sterile helper) ovary size is pleiotropically affected by quantitative trait loci that were initially identified for their effect on foraging behavior. To gain a better understanding of the genetic architecture of worker ovary size in this model system, we analyzed a series of crosses between the selected strains. The crossing results were heterogeneous and suggested non-additive effects. Three significant and three suggestive quantitative trait loci of relatively large effect sizes were found in two reciprocal backcrosses. These loci are not located in genome regions of known effects on foraging behavior but contain several interesting candidate genes that may specifically affect worker-ovary size. Thus, the genetic architecture of this life history syndrome may be comprised of pleiotropic, central regulators that influence several linked traits and other genetic factors that may be downstream and trait specific. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved 0018-067X/11.","Apis mellifera; ovarioles; QTL; social evolution; trait network; worker caste",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955104428

As an aid to testing hypotheses for the causes of colony failure we have developed a compartment model of honey bee colony population dynamics to explore the impact of different death rates of forager bees on colony growth and development. The model predicts a critical threshold forager death rate beneath which colonies regulate a stable population size. If death rates are sustained higher than this threshold rapid population decline is predicted and colony failure is inevitable. The model also predicts that high forager death rates draw hive bees into the foraging population at much younger ages than normal, which acts to accelerate colony failure. The model suggests that colony failure can be understood in terms of observed principles of honey bee population dynamics, and provides a theoretical framework for experimental investigation of the problem. © 2011 Khoury et al.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955145168

Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined according to the standard broth microdilution method. Some Candida albicans isolates showed resistance or dose-dependent susceptibility for the azolic drugs and Amphotericin B. Non-C. albicans isolates showed more resistance and dose-dependent susceptibility for the azolic drugs than C. albicans. However, all of them were sensitive or dose-dependent susceptible for Amphotericin B. All yeasts were inhibited by PE and PMs, with small variation, independent of the species of yeast. The overall results provided important information for the potential application of PMs in the therapy of VVC and the possible prevention of the occurrence of new symptomatic episodes.

In autumn and spring experiments, Varroa infestation levels of the treatment groups were significantly reduced after the oxalic and formic acid applications (p<0.05). After, the experiment in autumn, number of adult bee frames in the group treated with formic acid were found significantly lower than before the treatment (p<0.05). In this season, brood surface level in the group treated with oxalic acid were increased significantly (p<0.05) at the end of the spring experiment. The highest efficiency of organic acid (94.10%) were observed in the 1 st group (O/F) but it was not found different from other groups (p>0.05). © Medwell Journals, 2011.","Experiment; Formic acid; Honey bee; Oxalic acid; Varroa organic acids",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955022168

Honeybees communicate places by encoding distance and direction in their waggle dances [1]. Controversy exists not only about the structure of spatial memory but also about the efficiency of dance communication [2-5]. Some of these uncertainties were resolved by studies in which recruits' flights were monitored using harmonic radar [6, 7]. We asked whether the two sources of vector information - the previously learned flight vector to a food source and the communicated vector - are represented in a common frame of spatial reference. We found that recruits redirect their outbound flights and perform novel shortcut flights between the communicated and learned locations in both directions. Guidance by beacons at the respective locations or by the panorama of the horizon was excluded. These findings indicate a spatial reference based on either large-scale vector integration or a common geocentric map-like spatial memory. Both models predict a memory structure that stores the spatial layout in such a way that decisions are made according to estimated distances and directions. The models differ with respect to the role of landmarks and the time of learning of spatial relations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955482401

Chalkbrood is a chronic honeybee-specific disease that can persist in colonies for years, reducing both brood and honey production, whereas stonebrood is a rare facultative pathogen that also affects hosts other than honeybees and can likely survive outside insect hosts. Hive infection trials have indicated that accidental drops in comb temperature increase the prevalence of chalkbrood, but it has remained unclear whether virulence is directly temperature-dependent. We used a newly established in vitro rearing technique for honeybee larvae to test whether there are systematic temperature effects on mortality induced by controlled infections, and whether such effects differed between the two fungal pathogens. We found that increasing spore dosage at infection had a more dramatic effect on mortality from stonebrood compared to chalkbrood. In addition, a 24. h cooling period after inoculation increased larval mortality from chalkbrood infection, whereas such a cooling period decreased mortality after stonebrood infection. These results raise interesting questions about honeybee defenses against obligate and facultative pathogens and about the extent to which stress factors in the host (dis)favor pathogens with lesser degrees of specialization. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Apis mellifera; Ascosphaera; Aspergillus; Host-pathogen interactions; Temperature; Virulence",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952103168

Despite substantial empirical support, the generality of this hypothesis is not universally accepted. Thus, we investigated the prediction of particular genes with pleiotropic effects on ovarian traits and social behavior in worker honey bees as a stringent test of the reproductive ground plan hypothesis. We complemented these tests with a comprehensive genome scan for additional quantitative trait loci (QTL) to gain a better understanding of the genetic architecture of the ovary size of honey bee workers, a morphological trait that is significant for understanding social insect caste evolution and general insect biology. Results: Back-crossing hybrid European x Africanized honey bee queens to the Africanized parent colony generated two study populations with extraordinarily large worker ovaries. Despite the transgressive ovary phenotypes, several previously mapped QTL for social foraging behavior demonstrated ovary size effects, confirming the prediction of pleiotropic genetic effects on reproductive traits and social behavior. One major QTL for ovary size was detected in each backcross, along with several smaller effects and two QTL for ovary asymmetry. One of the main ovary size QTL coincided with a major QTL for ovary activation, explaining 3/4 of the phenotypic variance, although no simple positive correlation between ovary size and activation was observed. Conclusions: Our results provide strong support for the reproductive ground plan hypothesis of evolution in study populations that are independent of the genetic stocks that originally led to the formulation of this hypothesis. As predicted, worker ovary size is genetically linked to multiple correlated traits of the complex division of labor in worker honey bees, known as the pollen hoarding syndrome. The genetic architecture of worker ovary size presumably consists of a combination of trait-specific loci and general regulators that affect the whole behavioral syndrome and may even play a role in caste determination. Several promising candidate genes in the QTL intervals await further study to clarify their potential role in social insect evolution and the regulation of insect fertility in general. © 2011 Graham et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Asymmetry; Complex trait locus mapping; Pollen hoarding syndrome; Reproductive groundplan hypothesis; Social evolution; Worker reproduction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953876813

We quantified the invasion of V. destructor into mite free colonies on a military training area not accessible to other beekeepers. Ten ""mite receiver colonies"" continuously treated against V. destructor were placed at distances of one to 1.5 km from four heavily infested ""mite donor colonies"". Over a two month period from August to October, the population of bees, brood, and V. destructorin the donor colonies were estimated at three week intervals and the invasion of V. destructorinto the receiver colonies was recorded every 7-12 days. During the experimental period, between 85 and 444 mites per colony were introduced into the receiver colonies. There were no significant differences in the invasion rates in relation to the distance between donor and receiver colonies. In total, 2,029 mites were found in the 10 receiver colonies, but these only correspond to 2.5% of the total mite population in the donor colonies at the start of the experiment. This means that the major part of the initial V. destructorpopulation died together with the collapsed host colonies. Under natural conditions, a more benign behaviour should therefore be an adaptive strategy for V. destructor.

The animal should encounter ethanol in its natural habitat, so that the central nervous system of the organism will have evolved mechanisms for responding to ethanol exposure. How the brain adapts to ethanol exposure depends on its access to ethanol, which can be regulated metabolically and/or by physical barriers. Therefore, a model organism should have metabolic enzymes for ethanol degradation similar to those found in humans. The neurons and supporting glial cells of the model organism that regulate behaviors affected by ethanol should share the molecular and physiological pathways found in humans, so that results can be compared. Finally, the use of invertebrate models should offer advantages over traditional model systems and should offer new insights into alcoholism-related behaviors. In this review we will summarize behavioral similarities and identified genes and mechanisms underlying ethanol-induced behaviors in invertebrates. This review mainly focuses on the use of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the honey bee Apis mellifera and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as model systems. We will discuss insights gained from those studies in conjunction with their vertebrate model counterparts and the implications for future research into alcoholism and alcohol-induced behaviors. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.","Actions of ethanol; Alcohol abuse; Apis mellifera; Behaviors associated with alcoholism; Caenorhabditis elegans; Drosophila melanogaster; Ethanol metabolism; Honey bee; Intoxication; Invertebrates",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857948841

The genome was sequenced using 454 pyrosequencing, and the current assembly and annotation were completed in less than 1 y. Analyses of conserved gene groups (more than 1,200 manually annotated genes to date) suggest a high-quality assembly and annotation comparable to recently sequenced insect genomes using Sanger sequencing. The red harvester ant is a model for studying reproductive division of labor, phenotypic plasticity, and sociogenomics. Although the genome of P. barbatus is similar to other sequenced hymenopterans (Apis mellifera and Nasonia vitripennis) in GC content and compositional organization, and possesses a complete CpG methylation toolkit, its predicted genomic CpG content differs markedly from the other hymenopterans. Gene networks involved in generating key differences betweenthe queenandworker castes (e.g.,wingsandovaries) showsignatures of increasedmethylation and suggest that ants and bees may have independently co-opted the same gene regulatory mechanisms for reproductive division of labor. Gene family expansions (e.g., 344 functional odorant receptors) and pseudogene accumulation in chemoreception and P450 genes compared with A. mellifera and N. vitripennis are consistent with major life-history changes during the adaptive radiation of Pogonomyrmex spp., perhaps inparallel with the development of the North American deserts.","Chemoreceptor; De novo genome; Eusociality; Genomic evolution; Social insect",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955002712

Although all ants are eusocial, and display a variety of complex and fascinating behaviors, few genomic resources exist for them. Here, we report the draft genome sequence of a particularly widespread and well-studied species, the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), which was accomplished using a combination of 454 (Roche) and Illumina sequencing and community-based funding rather than federal grant support. Manual annotation of >1,000 genes from a variety of different gene families and functional classes reveals unique features of the Argentine ant's biology, as well as similarities to Apis mellifera and Nasonia vitripennis. Distinctive features of the Argentine ant genome include remarkable expansions of gustatory (116 genes) and odorant receptors (367 genes), an abundance of cytochrome P450 genes (>110), lineagespecific expansions of yellow/major royal jelly proteins and desaturases, and complete CpG DNA methylation and RNAi toolkits. The Argentine ant genome contains fewer immune genes than Drosophila and Tribolium, which may reflect the prominent role played by behavioral and chemical suppression of pathogens. Analysis of the ratio of observed to expected CpG nucleotides for genes in the reproductive development and apoptosis pathways suggests higher levels of methylation than in the genome overall. The resources provided by this genome sequence will offer an abundance of tools for researchers seeking to illuminate the fascinating biology of this emerging model organism.","Chemoreception; Hymenoptera; Invasive species; Sociality; Transcriptome",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954986915

The DraI COI-COII test discriminates between and within honeybee lineages (M, C, A and O). With this test, a global assessment of the diversity found in the M lineage (i.e. description of haplotype frequencies, fragment length and size, nucleotide sequences) is made with colonies newly sampled in France and Belgium (n = 3,261 colonies) and previously described in the literature (n = 3,367). A total of 91 M haplotypes were described including 52 new ones. The haplotypes M4 and M4' were the most frequent followed by M17, M7, M6, M19, M8, M17' and by many rare ones. Finally, these data were used to infer hypotheses on the putative origin of the M haplotypic diversity and to determine a protocol for the establishment of protected areas of black honeybee colonies. This protocol is based on the DraI COI-COII test and on case-studies of protected areas of black honeybees from France. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.","Apis mellifera mellifera; COI-COII; Conservation; DNA sequences; Honeybee; M lineage",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859748991

If this process fails, the colony becomes hopelessly queenless and workers activate their ovaries to lay eggs themselves. Laying Cape honeybee workers (Apis mellifera capensis) produce female offspring as an additional pathway for requeening. We tested the frequency of successful requeening in ten hopelessly queenless colonies. DNA genotyping revealed that only 8% of all queens reared in hopelessly queenless colonies were the offspring of native laying worker offspring. The vast majority of queens resulted from parasitic takeovers by foreign queens (27%) and invading parasitic workers (19%). This shows that hopelessly queenless colonies typically die due to parasitic takeovers and that the parasitic laying workers are an important life history strategy more frequently used than in providing a native queen to rescue the colony. Parasitism by foreign queens, which might enter colonies alone or accompanied by only a small worker force is much more frequent than previously considered and constitutes an additional life history strategy in Cape honeybees. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Cape honeybee; Parasitic queens; Parasitic workers; Queen rearing",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952656446

Also, the effects of insecticide exposure on the developmental instability of honey bees, Apis mellifera, were explored. In soil samples collected three months after insecticide treatments, endosulfan and profenofos concentrations varied in the range of 10-30μgkg-1 in the traditionally cultivated zones and 10-80μgkg-1 in the new cotton zones, indicating a pollution of agricultural lands. However, only profenofos concentrations were significantly higher in the new cotton zone than the traditionally cultivated zones. In addition, the index of fluctuating asymmetry, FA1, in the length of second tarsus (LHW) was increased for bees when exposed to pesticide treated cotton fields for 82d, and their FA levels were significantly higher than those in the control colony in an orchard. The other studied traits of bees exposed to insecticides were not significantly different from controls.

In the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, where honeybees are indigenous, managed hives potentially elevate the abundance of honeybees far above natural levels, but impacts on other floral resource-dependent species have not been studied. Here we use experimental manipulation of honeybee density to test whether honeybee farming affects nectar-feeding birds. We selected the common sugarbush (Protea repens), utilized by both birds and bees, and analysed the time (before/after) by treatment (control/experiment) interaction to explore changes in bee abundance, nectar availability and bird abundance at three sites. Hive addition increased honeybee abundance in inflorescences of P. repens above expected levels. Despite experimental increase in honeybee numbers, there is no reduction in nectar sugar availability relative to the control areas. Where honeybee density was highest, sugarxpected levels. Despite experimental increase in honeybee numbers, there is no reduction in nectar sugar availability relative to the control areas. Where honeybee density was highest, sugarbird (Promerops cafer) numbers declined relative to expected, but sunbirds (Nectarinidae) were not affected at any of the sites. We conclude that stocking rates of more than one honey bee per P. repens inflorescence have detrimental effects on bird abundance due to interference, rather than resource competition. © 2010 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer.","Biodiversity conservation; Competition; Ecosystem services; Pollination; Sugarbirds; Sunbirds",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551518821

It is known that workers rapidly learn a flower colour when rewarded with artificial nectar (sucrose solution). However, some previous studies report that the degree of constancy after training is unaffected by reward quantity and quality when bees are tested in an array of artificial flowers of two easily distinguished colours, such as blue and yellow. One possible reason for this surprising result is that large reward volumes were compared. This is likely to mask the abilities of foragers to make adaptive decisions under more realistic conditions. To test this possibility, we offered untrained honey bee workers ecologically relevant rewards (0.5, 1 or 2? l of 0.5 or 1?mol?l-1 sucrose solution) on one or two consecutive yellow or blue artificial flowers and then recorded which flowers the bees subsequently landed on in an array of 40 empty flowers. The results showed that an increase in all three factors (volume, concentration and number of rewards) significantly increased constancy (proportion of visits to flowers of the trained colour) and persistence (number of flowers visited) during the foraging bout. Constancy for the least rewarding situation was 75.9% compared with 98.6% for the most rewarding situation. These results clearly show that honey bee workers do become more constant to blue or yellow with increasing nectar rewards, provided that the rewards used are ecologically realistic. As the most rewarding conditions led to nearly 100% constancy, further reward increases during training would not have been able to further increase constancy. This explains why previous studies comparing large rewards found no effect of reward on constancy. © 2011.

Wax salvage would clearly be counter-productive unless the energy input/energy yield threshold was a profitable one. There are two possible trade-offs in this scenario, the trade-off between the energy expended to recover the wax (recovering hypothesis) as against that of replacing the wax by new secretion (replacing hypothesis). In order to compare the two hypotheses, the fuel costs involved in salvaging wax on one return trip, the average flower handling time, flight time and relative values for substituting the salvaged wax with nectar were calculated. Moreover, the energy value of the wax was determined. Net energy gains for salvaged wax were calculated. The energy value of the salvaged wax was 42.7 J/mg, thus too high to be the limiting factor since salvaging costs are only 642.76 mJ/mg (recovering hypothesis).

This energetic trade-off between replacing and recycling plus the small absconding range of A. florea might explain why A. florea is probably the only honeybee species known to salvage wax and it parsimoniously explains the underlying reasons why A. florea only salvages wax from the old nest if the new nesting site is less than 100-200 m away-energetically, it pays off to recycle. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Apis florea; Trade-off; Wax salvage",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952683643

Thus, it could be useful as a fumigant to decontaminate honey comb between uses. The experiments here are intended to determine the exposure levels required to kill an insect pest and spore forming bee pathogens. Ozone was effective against greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), even on naturally infested comb. Neonates and adults were the easiest life stages to kill, requiring only a few hours of exposure, whereas eggs required a 48-h exposure (at 460-920 mg O 3/m3). Two honey bee, Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), pathogens, Ascosphaera apis (a fungus that causes chalkbrood) and Paenibacillus larvae (a bacterium that causes American foulbrood), also were killed with ozone. These pathogens required much higher concentrations (3,200 and 8,560 mg O3/m3, respectively) and longer exposure periods (3 d) than needed to control the insects. P. larvae was effectively sterilized only when these conditions were combined with high temperature (50°C) and humidity (≥75% RH). Thus, ozone shows potential as a fumigant for bee nesting materials, but further research is needed to evaluate its acceptability and efficacy in the field.

Here we used histochemical, biochemical, and genetic techniques to investigate the fluctuation of age-related molecules in trophocytes and fat cells of newly emerged and old worker bees. Histochemical studies revealed that old worker trophocytes and fat cells exhibited more senescence-associated β-galactosidase, lipofuscin granules, and non-homogeneous cellular morphology compared to the same cells in newly emerged workers. Biochemical assays demonstrated that trophocytes and fat cells of old workers expressed more lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation than those of newly emerged workers. Molecular genetic analyses detected no difference in telomerase activity or telomere length in trophocytes and fat cells between newly emerged and old workers, showing that these cells do not divide in adulthood.

In Australia, stingless bees are important pollinators that use cerumen for nest construction and possibly for colony's health. While extensive research attests to the therapeutic properties of honeybee (Apis mellifera) propolis, the biological and medicinal properties of Australian stingless bee cerumen are largely unknown. In this study, the chemical and biological properties of polar extracts of cerumen from Tetragonula carbonaria in South East Queensland, Australia were investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses and in vitro 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) cell-free assays. Extracts were tested against comparative (commercial tincture of A. mellifera propolis) and positive controls (Trolox and gallic acid). Distinct GC-MS fingerprints of a mixed diterpenic profile typical of native bee cerumen were obtained with pimaric acid (6.31±0.97%, w/w), isopimaric acid (12.23±3.03%, w/w), and gallic acid (5.79±0.81%, w/w) tentatively identified as useful chemical markers. Characteristic flavonoids and prenylated phenolics found in honeybee propolis were absent. Cerumen extracts from T. carbonaria inhibited activity of 5-LOX, an enzyme known to catalyse production of proinflammatory mediators (IC50 19.97±2.67 μg/ml, mean±SEM, n=4). Extracts had similar potency to Trolox (IC50 12.78±1.82 μg/ml), but were less potent than honeybee propolis (IC50 5.90±0.62 μg/ml) or gallic acid (IC50 5.62±0.35 μg/ml, P&lt;0.001).

Foraging involves metabolically demanding flight, which in houseflies (Musca domestica) and fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) is associated with markers of ageing such as increased mortality and accumulation of oxidative damage. The role of flight in honeybee ageing is incompletely understood. We assessed relationships between honeybee flight activity and ageing by simulating rain that confined foragers to their colonies most of the day. After 15?days on average, flight-restricted foragers were compared with bees with normal (free) flight: one group that foraged for ~15?days and two additional control groups, for flight duration and chronological age, that foraged for ~5?days. Free flight over 15?days on average resulted in impaired associative learning ability. In contrast, flight-restricted foragers did as well in learning as bees that foraged for 5?days on average. This negative effect of flight activity was not influenced by chronological age or gustatory responsiveness, a measure of the bees' motivation to learn. Contrasting their intact learning ability, flight-restricted bees accrued the most oxidative brain damage as indicated by malondialdehyde protein adduct levels in crude cytosolic fractions. Concentrations of mono- and poly-ubiquitinated brain proteins were equal between the groups, whereas differences in total protein amounts suggested changes in brain protein metabolism connected to forager age, but not flight. We propose that intense flight is causal to brain deficits in aged bees, and that oxidative protein damage is unlikely to be the underlying mechanism. © 2011.

The outcomes of these multispecies interactions are often difficult to predict and are rarely studied. In addition to their theoretical importance, multispecies interactions are also important for management situations. Where multiple agents are used to control invasive species, interactions between agents may either enhance or reduce the impacts on the target species, or may simply have additive effects. In this study, conducted in a Mediterranean-type woodland in Australia, we examined how the interaction between an invasive legume, Cytisus scoparius (Leguminosae), its pollinator, Apis mellifera and a seed predator, Bruchidius villosus (Bruchidae), are modified by a native hemiparasitic vine, Cassytha pubescens (Loranthaceae). The parasite had a direct negative effect on C. scoparius, reducing flowering by 50% and consequently fruit and seed production. Despite having fewer flowers, infected plants had the same proportion of 'tripped' flowers, an indirect measure of pollinator visitation, as uninfected plants; although fruit formed on infected plants it was more likely to abort prematurely. Seed predation by B. villosus was lower on parasite-infected C. scoparius plants than in uninfected plants. Although Ca. pubescens had an antagonistic effect on B. villosus, in consort, the two agents reduced overall seed production by an average of 62%. The acquired parasite Ca. pubescens was more effective in reducing reproductive output than the introduced seed predator, B. villosus, and shows potential as a biocontrol agent for C. scoparius. We documented a subadditive effect of two biological enemies on the invasive species, where the acquired parasite had a stronger effect than the introduced seed predator. © 2010 The Authors.

As a result of this disturbance, introduced honeybees are now the dominant visitors to flowers instead of endemic bees on these islands. On the other hand, satellite islands not invaded by alien anoles have retained the native flower visitors. The effects of pollinator change on plant reproduction were surveyed on these contrasting island groups. The total visitation rates and the number of interacting visitor groups on main islands were 63% and 30% lower than that on satellite islands, respectively. On the main islands, the honeybees preferred to visit alien flowers, whereas the dominant endemic bees on satellite islands tended to visit native flowers more frequently than alien flowers. These results suggest that alien anoles destroy the endemic pollination system and caused shift to alien mutualism. On the main islands, the natural fruit set of alien plants was significantly higher than that of native plants. In addition, the natural fruit set was positively correlated with the visitation rate of honeybees. Pollen limitation was observed in 53.3% of endemic species but only 16.7% of alienspecies. These data suggest that reproduction of alien plants was facilitated by the floral preference of introduced honeybees. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Alien predator; Biological invasion; Introduced honeybee; Oceanic island; Visitation rate; Visitor diversity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952627022

Butterflies are another important insect order and a valued ecological resource in pollination. The current study conducted acute toxicity tests with naled, permethrin, and dichlorvos on fifth larval instar (caterpillars) and adults of different native Florida, USA, butterfly species to determine median lethal doses (24-h LD50), because limited acute toxicity data are available with this major insect group. Thorax- and wing-only applications of each insecticide were conducted. Based on LD50s, thorax and wing application exposures were acutely toxic to both caterpillars and adults. Permethrin was the most acutely toxic insecticide after thorax exposure to fifth instars and adult butterflies. However, no generalization on acute toxicity (sensitivity) of the insecticides could be concluded based on exposures to fifth instars versus adult butterflies or on thorax versus wing exposures of adult butterflies. A comparison of LD50s of the butterflies from this study (caterpillars and adults) with honeybee LD50s for the adult mosquito insecticides on a μg/organism or μg/g basis indicates that several butterfly species are more sensitive to these insecticides than are honeybees. A comparison of species sensitivity distributions for all three insecticides shows that permethrin had the lowest 10th percentile. Using a hazard quotient approach indicates that both permethrin and naled applications in the field may present potential acute hazards to butterflies, whereas no acute hazard of dichlorvos is apparent in butterflies. Butterflies should be considered as potential test organisms when nontarget insect testing of pesticides is suggested under FIFRA. © 2010 SETAC © 2011 SETAC.","Adult mosquito insecticides; Butterflies; Dichlorvos; Naled; Permethrin",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952292939

We determined whether foraging is improved in part because patriline diversity generates more responsive populations of scouting foragers. Scouts search for new food sources and advertise them with waggle dances to inform other foragers about unexploited discoveries. We moved multiple-patriline and single-patriline colonies to unfamiliar locations so that colonies relied heavily on successful scouts to initiate recruitment and then compared the development of foraging effort between the two types of colonies. More waggle dance signals were produced during the incipient stages of foraging in multiple-patriline colonies compared to single-patriline colonies because scouts reported food discoveries with longer dances. Scouts also returned to multiple-patriline colonies at rates that were two thirds higher than those of single-patriline colonies, although return rates for general forager populations were not significantly different between colony types. The distance of reported food sources from hives increased with time for all colonies, but by the end of their first day in an unfamiliar environment, maximal foraging reach was greater if colonies had multiple patrilines. Most scouts in multiple-patriline colonies came from a minority of scout-rich patrilines that were generally not those from which general forager populations were derived; the presence of such scout-rich patrilines was correlated with the extent of recruitment signaling in colonies. We show how a honeybee colony's scouting effort is (and is not) enhanced when extremely polyandrous queens produce genetically diverse colonies. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Extreme polyandry; Genetic diversity; Recruitment communication; Scouts; Waggle dancing",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952709877

This review begins by describing the principles of visual guidance that underlie perception of the world in three dimensions, obstacle avoidance, control of flight speed, and orchestrating smooth landings. We then consider how navigation over long distances is accomplished, with particular reference to how bees use information from the celestial compass to determine their flight bearing, and information from the movement of the environment in their eyes to gauge how far they have flown.

In the present work, the causes of poor natural fruit-set in Crateva adansonii DC. were investigated. Floral biology, the role of wind and insects in pollination and the breeding system of the species were studied in two natural populations for three consecutive seasons (200608). The flowers exhibited traits conducive to a mixture of wind and insect pollination (ambophily). Although a variety of insects visited the flowers, they were ineffective in pollinating. Nevertheless, active foraging by the honeybees (Apis dorsata, A. mellifera and A. cerana indica) facilitated enhanced pollen dispersal in the air and resulted in indirect pollination by wind. Airborne pollen grains pollinated the plants only up to 10m. Fruit-set from open pollination was comparable to wind-pollinated flowers. Supplemental pollination treatments established the occurrence of strong self-incompatibility (SI) (index of SI≤0.14). Spontaneous autogamy was prevented by pronounced herkogamy. Low natural fecundity in C. adansonii is due to pollination failure, pollen limitation (pollen limitation index≤0.98) and the sparse distribution of the conspecifics; partial SI may partly ensure reproductive assurance through geitonogamy. In the absence of a pollinator wind appears to act as a secondary mode of pollination. © 2011 CSIRO.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953117040

We obtained data on Africanized honey bee colony removals from water meter boxes in the greater Tucson metropolitan area from 1996 to 2008 to identify characteristics associated with the spatial distribution of Africanized honey bees across the city. Two generalized linear models were constructed to predict the occupation of water meter boxes based on land use, lot/structure characteristics, and the presence of colonies in neighboring water meter boxes. More than 8000 colonies were removed from water meter boxes during the 12-year study period. Colonies were more likely to occupy water meter boxes associated with residential (versus commercial) locations, smaller lots, older structures, closer distances to vacant land, and higher percentages of neighboring water meter boxes with colonies. Occupied water meter boxes and boxes with multiple occupancies were concentrated in South Central Tucson, suggesting this area provides abundant resources for honey bees and that well established, source colonies exist in this area.

Social insects have gained many novel morphological and behavioral traits relative to their solitary ancestors. The task repertoire of an advanced social insect, for example, can be 40-50 tasks, about twice that of a solitary wasp or bee. The genetic basis of this expansion in behavioral repertoire is still poorly understood, and a role for taxonomically restricted genes has not been explored at the whole genome level.Results: Here we present comparative genomics results suggesting that taxonomically restricted genes may have played an important role in generating the expansion of behavioral repertoire associated with the evolution of eusociality. First, we show that the current honey bee official gene set contains about 700 taxonomically restricted genes. These are split between orphans, genes found only in the Hymenoptera, and genes found only in insects. Few of the orphans or genes restricted to the Hymenoptera have been the focus of experimental work, but several of those that have are associated with novel eusocial traits or traits thought to have changed radically as a consequence of eusociality. Second, we predicted that if taxonomically restricted genes are important for generating novel eusocial traits, then they should be expressed with greater frequency in workers relative to the queen, as the workers exhibit most of the novel behavior of the honey bee relative to their solitary ancestors. We found support for this prediction. Twice as many taxonomically restricted genes were found amongst the genes with higher expression in workers compared to those with higher expression in queens. Finally, we compiled an extensive list of candidate taxonomically restricted genes involved in eusocial evolution by analyzing several caste specific gene expression data sets.Conclusions: This work identifies a large number of candidate taxonomically restricted genes that may have played a role in eusocial evolution. This work thus lays the foundation for future functional genomics work on the evolution of novelty in the context of social behavior. We also present preliminary evidence, based on biased patterns of gene expression, that taxonomically restricted genes may have played a role in the evolution of caste systems, a characteristic lineage specific social trait. © 2011 Johnson and Tsutsui; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953071614

Three dominant mutation types, including newborn vein, protrusion vein and missing vein, were observed in hind wing vein after lower temperature treatment. Only one newborn vein was found, which was a new radiomedial crossvein generated between radial sector shared by basal cell and marginal cell, and mediae shared by basal cell and discal cell. The new radiomedial crossvein was developed to different degrees. Some only had two protuberances protruding towards each other, some almost or completely connected forming a new vein. This new radiomedial crossvein, which was similar to the original radiomedial crossvein, often had a ""feeble point"" at its bottom. Since the original radiomedial croosvein is short, its existence has long been ignored and just looks like a ""point"" connecting two veins. Now we are sure that the radiomedial crossvein is existent connecting radial sector and mediae. Therefore, the two veins at the back of radiomedial croosvein protruding towards wing's outer margin were not the branches of mediae as generally accepted, but the extensions of radial sector and mediae. Two positions were found with protrusion mutations, the mediae and the radial sector, the mediae protruded towards basal cell and the radial sector protruded towards basal cell. There were different degrees of the protrusions. Some of protrusion veins protruded slightly, some protruded visibly and some protruded significantly forming a long vein. The protrusion veins of mediae were all observed at ""the turning point"". In addition, the protrusion veins of mediae were only found in drones instead of workers. Two kinds of missing vein were discovered in cubito-anal crossvein and mediae vein. The broken cubito- anal crossveins were found at the feeble point in both two capped broods of drones, which were incubated at constant lower developmental temperature of 30°C until emergence. The part of mediae protruding towards discal cell was missing in different degrees. Some of the veins were obviously shorten, some only had vestige left and some were mostly or completely missing. The part of mediae protruding towards discal cell was one of the main morphological features to discriminate A. mellefera and A. cerana. If this feature of A. cerana disappeared completely, it will made the mediae looks exactly the same as that of A. mellefela. This means that it provokes a challenge to the traditional method of honeybee taxonomy based on the vein morphological feature. These discoveries of new mutations in hind wing vein of A. cerana will have a significant influence on the study of germplasm resources evaluation, evolutional biology and phylogenetics of honeybee. A further study of the effect of temperature on the development of honeybee wing vein may provide new ideas to research vein's developmental process, to reveal regulatory mechanism and physiological mechanisms of temperature adaptation of honeybee.","Apis cerana cerana; Development; Temperature; Vein",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952775530

Here, we investigated whether an insect, the honeybee (Apis mellifera), can form a conceptual representation of an above/below spatial relationship. In experiment 1, bees were trained with differential conditioning to choose a variable target located above or below a black bar that acted as constant referent throughout the experiment. In experiment 2, two visual stimuli were aligned vertically, one being the referent, which was kept constant throughout the experiment, and the other the target, which was variable. In both experiments, the distance between the target and the referent, and their location within the visual field was systematically varied. In both cases, bees succeeded in transferring the learned concept to novel stimuli, preserving the trained spatial relation, thus showing an ability to manipulate this relational concept independently of the physical nature of the stimuli. Absolute location of the referent into the visual field was not a low-level cue used by the bees to solve the task. The honeybee is thus capable of conceptual learning despite having a miniature brain, showing that such elaborated learning form is not a prerogative of vertebrates. © 2010 The Royal Society.","Above/below relationship; Apis mellifera; Concept learning; Honeybee; Rule learning; Visual cognition",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952337547

The aim of the study was to identify non-timber forest product plants being used from the target area, to identify the trade network that they are sold into, and to evaluate their value as they move within that network in order to make recommendations for socio-economic development of the area. Information was learned through semi-structured questionnaires and participatory interviews with resource uses and traders. 214 species in 79 families were identified as being useful in traditional livelihood. Of these, 150 were herbs, 36 trees, 26 shrubs and 4 climbers. Plant species are locally used as medicinal (115), multipurpose (35), fodder (31), fuel (30), vegetables (12), tools (12), timber (9), poisons (7), roof thatch (7), wild fruits (6), fences/ hedges (5), veterinary (5), mud supporter (5), foods (4), spices/condiments (4), religious (4), honey bee (3), brooms (3), and evil repellent (1). Twenty out of 115 medicinal species are collected to sell. The gatherers have very little marketing skills and are often not aware of the high market value. As a result, most of collected materials are sold to local middlemen at low prices. The study revealed that the availability of important medicinal and aromatic plant species is decreasing and the number of rare and threatened species among the medicinal and aromatic plants is increasing. Further study is, therefore, required to quantify the availability of species and to suggest suitable method for their production and conservation. Recommendations are, therefore, given in the spheres of training in identification, sustainable collection, value addition, trade monitoring and cooperative system of marketing.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952459514

We conducted studies to examine possible direct and indirect effects of pesticide exposure from contaminated brood comb on developing worker bees and adult worker lifespan.Methodology/Principal Findings:Worker bees were reared in brood comb containing high levels of known pesticide residues (treatment) or in relatively uncontaminated brood comb (control). Delayed development was observed in bees reared in treatment combs containing high levels of pesticides particularly in the early stages (day 4 and 8) of worker bee development. Adult longevity was reduced by 4 days in bees exposed to pesticide residues in contaminated brood comb during development. Pesticide residue migration from comb containing high pesticide residues caused contamination of control comb after multiple brood cycles and provided insight on how quickly residues move through wax. Higher brood mortality and delayed adult emergence occurred after multiple brood cycles in contaminated control combs. In contrast, survivability increased in bees reared in treatment comb after multiple brood cycles when pesticide residues had been reduced in treatment combs due to residue migration into uncontaminated control combs, supporting comb replacement efforts. Chemical analysis after the experiment confirmed the migration of pesticide residues from treatment combs into previously uncontaminated control comb.Conclusions/Significance:This study is the first to demonstrate sub-lethal effects on worker honey bees from pesticide residue exposure from contaminated brood comb. Sub-lethal effects, including delayed larval development and adult emergence or shortened adult longevity, can have indirect effects on the colony such as premature shifts in hive roles and foraging activity. In addition, longer development time for bees may provide a reproductive advantage for parasitic Varroa destructor mites.

Although the Class of the Insecta is the largest animal taxon on Earth, almost all information concerning glycosylation in insects is derived from studies with only one species, namely the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this report, the differences in glycoproteomes between insects belonging to several economically important insect orders were studied. Using GNA (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin) affinity chromatography, different sets of glycoproteins with mannosyl-containing glycan structures were purified from the flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum), the silkworm (Bombyx mori), the honeybee (Apis mellifera), the fruit fly (D. melanogaster) and the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum). To identify and characterize the purified glycoproteins, LC-MS/MS analysis was performed. For all insect species, it was demonstrated that glycoproteins were related to a broad range of biological processes and molecular functions. Moreover, the majority of glycoproteins retained on the GNA column were unique to one particular insect species and only a few glycoproteins were present in the five different glycoprotein sets. Furthermore, these data support the hypothesis that insect glycoproteins can be decorated with mannosylated O-glycans. Conclusions/Significance: The results presented here demonstrate that oligomannose N-glycosylation events are highly specific depending on the insect species. In addition, we also demonstrated that protein O-mannosylation in insect species may occur more frequently than currently believed. © 2011 Vandenborre et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952026872

Results showed a clear differentiation between the main three northern ecological regions. Differences involve mostly shape, while size contribution is generally weak. Within regions, shape variability between apiaries and colonies does not appear related either to the geographic location or to altitude. The large variability observed at the colony and apiary levels can possibly be related to anthropogenic introductions or exchanges, and it is concluded that both drift and polyandry are the most probable explanations. Finally, phenotypic differences between ecological regions probably result from restrictions to gene flow between their respective populations. Nevertheless, the relative contributions of local adaptations to environmental factors and to beekeeping remain to be established.","Apis mellifera; forewing venation; geometric morphometrics; landmarks; Procrustes superimposition; regional populations; shape; size",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953719410

Since this discovery, many studies have attempted to characterize the impact of this parasite in A. mellifera honey bees. Nosema species can infect all colony members, workers, drones and queens, but the pathological effects of this microsporidium has been mainly investigated in workers, despite the prime importance of the queen, who monopolizes the reproduction and regulates the cohesion of the society via pheromones. We therefore analyzed the impact of N. ceranae on queen physiology. We found that infection by N. ceranae did not affect the fat body content (an indicator of energy stores) but did alter the vitellogenin titer (an indicator of fertility and longevity), the total antioxidant capacity and the queen mandibular pheromones, which surprisingly were all significantly increased in Nosema-infected queens. Thus, such physiological changes may impact queen health, leading to changes in pheromone production, that could explain Nosema-induced supersedure (queen replacement). © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Antioxidant capacity; Apis mellifera; Honey bee queen; Nosema ceranae; Queen mandibular pheromones; Vitellogenin",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79751524555

However, there is considerable variation in the methodologies associated with these assays, and as such, it is not always clear how to interpret results. We have optimised assays for measuring phenoloxidase in its active (PO) and zymogen (ProPO) forms in the honey bee, Apis mellifera. Contrary to results for other insects, we found that the activator α-chymotrypsin, when used at a low concentration (0.5 mg mL -1), combined with a minimal activation time (5 min), provided optimal conditions for assaying ProPO. In addition, a saturated L-dopa solution was required for assaying both PO and ProPO.

The specialization of different individuals in different tasks increases the overall work performance and efficiency. Specialization is thought to be the very foundation of the success of human societies but also in complex colonies of social insects. In human societies an advanced form of division of labour, especially since the industrialisation, is shift work, where individuals perform the same task but in subsequent cohorts in time. Although social insects can measure and are aware of time, shift work has not been documented in colonies of social insects so far. We observed foragers of two honeybee (Apis mellifera) colonies (approximately 140 workers each) and genotyped them with microsatellite DNA markers. We determined paternity and assigned them to the various subfamilies in the colony to test whether there is genetic variance for shift work in foraging honeybees. We could show that the patriline identity of the foragers had a significant effect on foraging either in the morning or evening. Individual foragers differed in their preference for the ""early"" or ""late"" shift, and shift work indeed existed in the colony. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Apis mellifera; Chronotype; Division of labour; Honeybee; Microsatellites; Morningness-eveningness",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952438096

Recently we found that 9-HDA is present in royal jelly as a mixture of optical isomers (R:S, 2:1). The finding leads us to suspect that chiral fatty acids in royal jelly are precursors of semiochemicals. Rather than looking for semiochemicals in the mandibular glands of the queen bee, this study involves the search for precursors of pheromones from large quantities of royal jelly. Seven chiral hydroxy fatty acids, 9,10-dihydroxy-2E-decenoic, 4,10-dihydroxy-2E-decenoic, 4,9-dihydroxy-2E-decenoic, 3-hydroxydecanoic, 3,9-dihydroxydecanoic, 3,11-dihydroxydodecanoic, and 3,10-dihydroxydecanoic acids were isolated.

Here we used the honeybee Apis mellifera, where seminal fluid can be collected as part of a male's ejaculate, and performed a series of experiments to investigate the effects of seminal fluid and its components on sperm viability. We show that honeybee seminal fluid is highly potent in keeping sperm alive and this positive effect is present over a 24 h time span, comparable to the timing of the sperm storage process in the queen. We furthermore show that the presence of proteins within the seminal fluid and their structural integrity are crucial for this effect. Finally, we activated sperm using fructose and provide evidence that the positive effect of seminal fluid proteins on sperm survival cannot be replicated using generic protein substitutes.

The acid usually used in such a reaction is the citric acid, however, due to the difficulty that small producers have to obtain the product commercially, an alternative would be to replace it with lemon juice. The objective of this work was to quantify the inversion of sucrose present in Apis mellifera worker diets by employing commercial citric acid and lemon juice. A total of 21 aqueous solutions of granulated sugar at the proportion of 100 g/100 mL were prepared, placing in each one 1.0; 2.0; 3.0; 5.0; 10.0; 15.0 or 20.0 mL of the juices of the Galego [Citrus aurantifolia (C.)

In addition to those, six other aqueous sucrose solutions were prepared by adding 0.0 (control); 0.16; 0.3; 0.5 and 0.7 g citric acid. Sucrose inversion was quantified by using the Somogyi-Nelson method. For the Cravo lemon, the lowest inversion rate was found. Regarding the addition of citric acid, it was estimated that in placing 0.1 g, the inversion was of 12.2% while with 0.16 g, an inversion of 18.8% sucrose present in the solution. The maximum amount of citric acid to be added was estimated to be 0.18 g, adopting as a criterion the mean pH of 3.3 in Africanized bee honey. If Galego, Tahiti and Cravo lemon juices are used as replacements for the citric acid, the maximum added amount should be 2.1, 3.6 and 5.3 mL, respectively, for each 100 g sugar/100 mL water, at fixed pH of 3.3.

Both data sets were found to be highly consistent and corroborated a marked divergence of West European subspecies from North African ones.

The bees accepted the new nourishment, which was consumed within 24-48 h and was administered in two independent trials (every 14-15 days for 3 consecutive months in one case, and once a month for 13 consecutive months in the other). From late spring - early summer (2008) the photo-records and statistical analyses revealed significant differences in the open and the operculated brood areas in the treated group compared with the control. This stimulation was observed after the first administration of the lactobacilli and maintained throughout. Also, a higher number of bees were measured in the treated group (54%) and the control (18%) with respect to the initial bees' number. Furthermore, honey storage was higher, 40% and 19%, for the treated and control groups, respectively. From December 2008 to December 2009, a similar situation was observed even though, in this trial, the lactobacilli cells were administered once a month. The in vivo results of this study are promising and indicate that a L. johnsonii CRL1647 supplement to beehives favours mainly open and operculated brood areas, demonstrating a stronger stimulation of egg-laying and will become a natural product which will assist the beekeeper both in colony management and the creation of late nuclei and/or bee packages due to its beneficial effects in the beehive colony. © 2011 Wageningen Academic Publishers.","Beneficial microbes; Honeybee; Lactobacillus johnsonii; Probiotics",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954624200

We investigated the efficacy of organic products which were applied as dust, diluted in sugar syrup trickled onto the bees and dissolved in ethanol embedded in venniculite blocks. The best results were obtained with thymol applied in dust (89.98%) and in venniculite (77.15%). The lowest efficacies were those of the oxalic acid treatments (<50%). There was a positive correlation between temperature and mite mortality for the thymol in dust and for the thymol in venniculite methods (r = 0.73 and r = 0.71, respectively). Conversely, a negative conelation was found between humidity and mite mortality for thymol applied in dust (r = -0.71). Mite mortality in oxalic acid treatments did not show significant conelation with climatic variables, except when combined with thymol and applied in venniculite blocks (r = 0.70).

We measured the antennal sensillum potential in response to Apis florea mandibular gland pheromone and showed that it is robust and reliable in forager and guard bees. Mandibular gland pheromone may be involved in signaling alarm or foraging resource depletion. Changes of antennal sensilla placodea potential of A. florea foragers and guards were measured after exposure to three concentrations of the synthetic pheromones, 2-heptanone and (Z)-11-eicosen-1-ol, using a potentiostat connected to an e-corder (ED401) with microelectrodes. The resting sensillum potential of A. florea foragers and guards were -55.37 ± 3.44 and -52.85 ± 5.34. mV, respectively. The sensillum potential of bees exposed to 1.0%, 5.0% and 10.0% (Z)-11-eicosen-1-ol were -23.35 ± 0.98, -16.78 ± 1.94 and -24.24 ± 8.20. mV, respectively, in foragers, and -21.95 ± 3.21, -21.42 ± 4.73 and -13.54 ± 4.16. mV, respectively, for guards. Exposure of bees to 1.0%, 5.0% and 10.0% 2-heptanone induced sensillum potentials of -10.64 ± 2.44, -44.88 ± 2.41 and -48.84 ± 4.40. mV, respectively, in foragers and 15.85 ± 9.38, -25.48 ± 1.43 and -15.52 ± 6.61. mV, respectively, in guards.

In general, except for the response to 1.0% 2-heptanone, the sensillum potentials of all bees to (Z)-11-eicosen-1-ol were higher than that of 2-heptanone.

A hybrid zone separates the two, but on at least three occasions the northern population has become infested by reproductive workers derived from the southern population. These parasitic workers lay in host colonies parthenogenetically, resulting in yet more parasites. The current infestation is 20-year old-surprising because an asexual lineage is expected to show a decline in vigor over time due to increasing homozygosity. The decline is expected to be acute in honey bees, where homozygosity at the sex locus is lethal. We surveyed colonies from the zone of infestation and genotyped putative parasites at two sets of linked microsatellite loci. We confirm that there is a single clonal lineage of parasites that shows minor variations arising from recombination events. The lineage shows high levels of heterozygosity, which may be maintained by selection against homozygotes, or by a reduction in recombination frequency within the lineage. We suggest that the clonal lineage can endure the costs of asexual reproduction because of the fitness benefits of its parasitic life history. © 2010 The Author(s).

We also placed an artificial visitor on flowers and observed subsequent responses of natural visitors. The responses of foraging bees to the presence of other visitors varies among species; O. orientalis more frequently visited flowers on which dead Micrandrena spp. were placed than flowers on which dead bees of other species were deployed.

For organisms living in highly structured groups of related individuals, such as colonies of social insects, personalities could also emerge at the group level. However, while numerous recent studies have investigated individual-level personality, the phenomenon of collective personality in animal groups has received little attention. In this paper, we apply the concept of collective personality to colonies of honeybees (Apis mellifera). We document the presence of consistent differences among colonies across a wide range of collective behaviours and demonstrate a link between colony-level personality traits and fitness. The colonies in our study showed consistent behavioural differences in traits such as defensive response, foraging activity and undertaking, and several of these traits were correlated as part of a behavioural syndrome. Furthermore, some of these traits were strongly tied to colony productivity and winter survival. Our results show that the concept of collective personality is applicable to colonies of social insects, and that personality differences among colonies can have important consequences for their long-term survival and reproduction. Applying the concept of personality to close-knit animal groups can provide important insights into the structure of behavioural variability in animal populations and the role that consistent between-group behavioural differences play in the evolution of behaviour. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Animal personality; Behavioural syndrome; Collective behaviour; Colony fitness; Honeybee",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79851513959

This increases the genetic diversity of their colonies, and consequently their fitness. After copulation, drones leave a mating sign in the genital opening of the queen which has been shown to promote additional mating of the queen. On one hand, this signing behavior is beneficial for the drone because it increases the genetic diversity of the resulting colony that is to perpetuate his genes. On the other hand, it decreases the proportion of the drone's personal offspring among colony members which is reducing drone fitness. We analyze the adaptiveness and evolutionary stability of this drone's behavior with a game-theoretical model. We find that theoretically both the strategy of leaving a mating sign and the strategy of not leaving a mating sign can be evolutionary stable, depending on natural parameters. However, the signing strategy is not favored for most scenarios, including the cases that are biologically plausible in reference to empirical data. We conclude that leaving a sign is not in the interest of the drone unless it serves biological functions other than increasing subsequent queen mating chances. Nevertheless, our analysis can also explain the prevalence of such a behavior of honey bee drones by a very low evolutionary pressure for an invasion of the nonsigning strategy. © 2010 Society for Mathematical Biology.","ESS; Game theory; Mating behavior; Mating plug; Multiple mating; Social insects; Strategy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952574412

However, queen bees are fertile, larger and have a longer lifespan than their female worker counterparts. Differential feeding of larvae with royal jelly controls this caste switching. There is emerging evidence that the queen-bee phenotype is driven by epigenetic mechanisms. In this study, we show that royal jelly-the secretion produced by the hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands of worker bees-has histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) activity. A fatty acid, (E)-10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10HDA), which accounts for up to 5% of royal jelly, harbours this HDACi activity. Furthermore, 10HDA can reactivate the expression of epigenetically silenced genes in mammalian cells. Thus, the epigenetic regulation of queen-bee development is probably driven, in part, by HDACi activity in royal jelly. © 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization Embo.","Apis mellifera; epigenetic; HDAC inhibitor; phenotypic plasticity; royal jelly",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952280451

Only a limited number of studies has investigated the impact of pesticides on homing flight due to the difficulty of measuring the flight time between the food source and the hive. Monitoring the flights of the foraging bees needs their individual identification. The number of bees monitored simultaneously and the time span during which observations can be made limit most of the monitoring techniques. However, techniques of automatic tracking and identification of individuals have the potential to revolutionize the study of the ecotoxicological effects of xenobiotics on the bee behaviors. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) offer numerous advantages such as an unlimited number of codes, a large number of simultaneous recording, and a quick reading, especially through materials (e.g., wood). The aim of this study was to show how the RFID device can be used to study the effects of pesticides on both the behavioral traits and the lifespan of bees. In this context, we have developed a method under tunnel to automatically record the displacements of foragers individualized with RFID tags and to detect the alteration of the flight pattern between an artificial feeder and the hive. Fipronil was selected as test substance due to the lack of information on the effects of this insecticide on the foraging behavior of free-flying bees. We showed that oral treatment of 0.3 ng of fipronil per bee (LD50/20) reduced the number of foraging trips. The strengths of our approach were briefly discussed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Automatic monitoring; Foraging; Honeybee; Life-history traits; Pesticides; RFID tags",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951670495

We critically examined the effects of nonrepairable damage in a model system that enabled us to separate the effects of damage from other correlated effects of senescence. Compared to sham controls, honeybees with 20% of their front wings trimmed continued to forage at similar rates and reduced their net rate of food delivery by approximately 20%. The changes in flight behaviour allowing the foragers to cope with the substantial wing damage probably occurred immediately following wing trimming. Bees showed no increase in foraging performance either in successive trips or during the 2 days following wing trimming. The cost of maintaining relatively high foraging performance after sustaining severe wing damage was approximately a 20% increase in mortality rate, most likely owing to predation. Our results illustrate a remarkable versatility of honeybees' flight behaviour, which allows them to handle the inevitable nonrepairable body damage that naturally occurs with ageing. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Apis mellifera; Bee; Experience; Foraging; Insect; Senescence; Wing damage; Wing wear",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79851508176

For example, it is widely accepted that desert ants and honey bees, but also mammals, use path integration for finding the way back to their home site. It is however a matter of a long standing debate whether animals in addition are able to acquire and use so called cognitive maps. Such a 'map', a global spatial representation of the foraging area, is generally assumed to allow the animal to find shortcuts between two sites although the direct connection has never been travelled before. Using the artificial neural network approach, here we develop an artificial memory system which is based on path integration and various landmark guidance mechanisms (a bank of individual and independent landmark-defined memory elements). Activation of the individual memory elements depends on a separate motivation network and an, in part, asymmetrical lateral inhibition network. The information concerning the absolute position of the agent is present, but resides in a separate memory that can only be used by the path integration subsystem to control the behaviour, but cannot be used for computational purposes with other memory elements of the system. Thus, in this simulation there is no neural basis of a cognitive map. Nevertheless, an agent controlled by this network is able to accomplish various navigational tasks known from ants and bees and often discussed as being dependent on a cognitive map. For example, map-like behaviour as observed in honey bees arises as an emergent property from a decentralized system. This behaviour thus can be explained without referring to the assumption that a cognitive map, a coherent representation of foraging space, must exist. We hypothesize that the proposed network essentially resides in the mushroom bodies of the insect brain. © 2011 Cruse, Wehner.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953654331

These processes can fundamentally disrupt the interactions between plants and pollinators and decrease reproductive success. This concerns especially self-incompatible, non-clonal species that depend on pollination for successful reproduction. In two rare and endangered heathland plant species, Genista anglica and G. pilosa, we examined pollination and reproduction in relation to population size. Eight populations of G. anglica and ten populations of G. pilosa were surveyed in the vicinity of Bremen, NW-Germany. We counted the visits of pollinators (honeybees, bumblebees, and other insects) and determined the reproductive output of the observed shoots. Contrary to our expectation to find increased pollinator visitation rates in larger populations of both Genista species, the number of flower-visiting insects was unrelated to the number of flowering shoots. Increasing shoot length had a positive and increasing temperature a negative impact on the number of visiting honeybees and bumblebees. Despite the general absence of population size effects on pollinator numbers, the number of fruits and seeds in G. anglica increased with increasing population size. Fruit and seed set in G. pilosa were negatively related to the number of 'other insects'. Our field observations showed that larger populations of both Genista species flowered earlier than smaller populations and much earlier than reported in the literature. Flowering in large populations therefore tends to coincide less well with pollinator abundance, and this may cause a disruption of the temporal coincidence between flowering phenology and pollinator activity. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.","Dry heathland; Habitat fragmentation; Pollinator activity; Population size; Reproductive output",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951772652

We investigated this hypothesis by comparing (1) the number of nest sites and the distances communicated by nest-site dancers on swarms from which vibrators were and were not removed and (2) the behavior of scouts visiting higher-quality (HQ) and lower-quality (LQ) nest boxes. The removal of vibrators from swarms did not alter the number of nest sites investigated, the distances traveled to nest sites, or the time required to select a new nest cavity. In contrast, vibrator removal tripled the time required for swarms to achieve liftoff after a cavity had been selected, although all swarm eventually became airborne and moved to a new site. About 14% of the scouts that visited the HQ and LQ nest boxes performed vibration signals; however, nest-box quality did not influence the tendency to produce the signal or intermix vibration signals and recruitment dances. However, we did find a significant, positive correlation between overall levels of vibration signal activity and nest-site recruitment during the house-hunting process. When viewed in concert, our results suggest that the vibration signal contributes to the house-hunting process by operating in a non-specific manner that may enhance scouting and recruitment in general during nest-site selection and facilitate rapid swarm liftoff after a new nest site has been chosen. The vibration signal is therefore a component in the cascade of communication signals that orchestrate house-hunting and colony relocation decisions. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551518183

The aim of this study was the evaluation of the radiosensitising capacity of Propolis in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. Materials and methods: HNSCC cell lines (FaDu, UT-SCC15, UT-SCC45), fibroblasts (HSF2) and keratinocytes (HaCaT) were treated with Propolis (0-250 μg/ml; 1, 4, 24 h) without and in combination with X-rays (0-6 Gy, single dose). Clonogenic survival, proliferation, apoptosis, expression and phosphorylation of different signalling proteins were determined. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed on Propolis. Results: Propolis significantly (P < 0.01) reduced cell growth and clonogenic survival in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Propolis-induced apoptosis and Caspase 3 cleavage, increased phosphorylation of Extracellular signal Regulated Kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), protein kinase B/Akt1 (Akt1) and Focal adhesion kinase (FAK). While a 1-h Propolis pretreatment was ineffective, a 3-h pretreatment significantly (P < 0.05) radiosensitised FaDu cells. LC-MS analysis identified 14 compounds of Propolis.

In the spring time, many clues can be seen in the hive, which sometimes demonstrate the proximity to swarming, such as the presence of more or less mature queen cells. In spite of this the actual date and time of swarming cannot be predicted accurately, as we still need to better understand this important physiological event. Here we show that, by means of a simple transducer secured to the outside wall of a hive, a set of statistically independent instantaneous vibration signals of honey bees can be identified and monitored in time using a fully automated and non-invasive method. The amplitudes of the independent signals form a multi-dimensional time-varying vector which was logged continuously for eight months. We found that combined with specifically tailored weighting factors, this vector provides a signature highly specific to the swarming process and its build up in time, thereby shedding new light on it and allowing its prediction several days in advance. The output of our monitoring method could be used to provide other signatures highly specific to other physiological processes in honey bees, and applied to better understand health issues recently encountered by pollinators. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Honey bee; PCA; Swarming; Vibrations",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955116818

However, foragers sometimes switch back again to brood care and become reverted nurses. Behavioural and physiological correlates of the transition nurse-forager (behavioural maturation) and forager-reverted nurse (behavioural reversion) are relatively well known in the honeybee, although they are less explored in ants. To understand better the role of biogenic amines in ant behavioural maturation and behavioural reversion, the levels of octopamine (OA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) are examined in the brains of nurses, foragers and reverted nurses of the red wood ant Formica polyctena Först. (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Brain OA levels and the ratios OA DA and OA 5-HT are higher in nurses than in foragers and reverted nurses. Reverted nurses and foragers do not differ significantly with respect to brain biogenic amine levels and amine ratios. Biogenic amine levels in brains of workers of F. polyctena are thus maturation-related rather than task-related. This is one of the first studies of neurochemical correlates of ant behavioural maturation and the first attempt to identify neurobiological correlates of ant behavioural reversion. The data obtained provide further evidence that neurobiological processes underlying honeybee and ant behavioural maturation and behavioural reversion reveal important differences. © 2010 The Authors.

Although it is becoming increasingly clear that different behavioral states are associated with different profiles of brain gene expression, it is not known whether this relationship extends to states that are as dynamic and specific as those associated with foraging-related spatiotemporal memories. We tested this hypothesis by training different groups of foragers from the same colony to collect sucrose solution from one of two artificial feeders; each feeder was in a different location and had sucrose available at a different time, either in the morning or afternoon. Bees from both training groups were collected at both the morning and afternoon training times to result in one set of bees that was undergoing stereotypical food anticipatory behavior and another that was inactive for each time of day. Between the two groups with the different spatiotemporal memories, microarray analysis revealed that 1329 genes were differentially expressed in the brains of honey bees. Many of these genes also varied with time of day, time of training or state of food anticipation. Some of these genes are known to be involved in a variety of biological processes, including metabolism and behavior. These results indicate that distinct spatiotemporal foraging memories in honey bees are associated with distinct neurogenomic signatures, and the decomposition of these signatures into sets of genes that are also influenced by time or activity state hints at the modular composition of this complex neurogenomic phenotype. © 2011.

The theoretical maximum number of seeds that can be produced per white clover floret is six, based on the number of ovules present. Based on the number of seeds resulting from a single bee visit (mean=1.24), it is calculated that in an 8 h foraging day, 19,420 bees would be required per hectare to reach maximum seed number per floret, assuming that no floret received more visits than required.

This paper presents a management model with the economic objective of maximising the net benefit derived from a pumped freshwater volume while eliminating the utility cost in coastal aquifers threatened by saltwater intrusion. Because the search space is both discontinuous and extremely wide, and also contains numerous local minima, evolutionary algorithms can be helpful in the search for near-optimal solutions. In this paper, a simulation model of the sharp saltwater-freshwater interface is considered to be time-independent. Moreover, the honey-bee mating optimisation (HBMO) algorithm is applied to a test case and the results are compared with those of a previously developed genetic algorithm (GA) for the same case. The comparison indicates that the HBMO algorithm can be effectively used to obtain near-global optimal solutions for the problem under consideration. The HBMO algorithm is then applied to the management of the coastal aquifer underlying the city of Miami Beach in northeastern Spain. Compared with the GA, the HBMO algorithm results show a significantly better performance and advantages in terms of both the final objective function value (more benefit) obtained and total pumped discharge from the system. Furthermore, the efficiency of the HBMO algorithm in handling non-linear discontinuous groundwater simulation/optimisation problems much more quickly than the GA is a promising point for further use of the algorithm in the field of groundwater optimisation.","Groundwater; Mathematical modelling; Water supply",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952228953

The 64.5 cm total length, 56 cm effective length, 75 μm ID, and 360 μm OD uncoated fused-silica capillary was used. The samples were injected into the capillary under a 50-mbar pressure for 7 s. There were 15 kV of electric field across the capillary applied. The current intensity was 26 μA. The separation was carried out at 25 °C. The analysis was run with the normal electrode polarity. The following steps and parameters were taken into account for the validation of the developed method: selectivity, precision, accuracy, linearity, limit of detection and limit of quantitation. All steps of the validation procedure proved that the developed analytical procedure was suitable for its intended purpose. Possibly this was the first study in which several honeybee venom components were separated and five of them were identified by capillary zone electrophoresis. In addition, the developed method was applied for quantitative analysis of 38 honeybee venom samples. The content (relative to the dry venom mass) of analyzed peptides in honeybee venom samples collected in 2002-2007 was as follows: apamine from 0.93% to 4.34% (mean, 2.85±0.79%); mast cell degranulating peptide (MCDP) from 1.46% to 4.37% (mean, 2.82±0.64%); phospholipase A2 from 7.41% to 20.25% (mean, 12.95±3.09%); melittin from 25.40% to 60.27%, (mean, 45.91±9.78%). The results were compared with the experimental data obtained for the same venom samples analyzed earlier by the HPLC method. It was stated that HPCE and HPLC data did not differ significantly and that the HPCE method was the alternative for the HPLC method. Moreover, using the results obtained principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to clarify the general distribution patterns or similarities of four major honeybee venom constituents collected from two different bee strains in various months and years. PCA has shown that the strain of bee appears to be the only criteria for bee venom sample classification. Strong correlations between apamine, MCDP, phospholipase A 2, and melittin were confirmed. These correlations have to be taken into account in the honeybee venom standardization. The developed method due to its simplicity can be easily automated and incorporated into routine operations both in the bee venom identification, quality control, and standardization of the product. © 2011 The Author(s).","Bioanalytical methods; Biological samples; Capillary electrophoresis; Chemometrics/statistics; HPLC; Natural products",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951814504

Time for the Epigenome"" trumpets the appearance of the International Human Epigenome Consortium and likens it to Biology's equivalent of the Large Hadron Collider. It strongly endorses the viewpoint that selective modifications of ""marks"" on DNA and histones constitute the crucial codes of life, a proposition which is hotly contested (Ptashne et al., in 2010). This proposition reflects the current mindset that DNA and histone modifications are the prime movers in gene regulation during evolution. This claim is perplexing, since the well characterized organisms, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, lack methylated DNA ""marks"" and the DNA methytransferase enzymology. Despite their complete absence, D. melanogaster nevertheless has extensive gene regulatory networks which drive sophisticated development, gastrulation, migration of germ cells and yield a nervous system with significant neural attributes. In stark contrast, the honey bee Apis mellifera deploys its human-type DNA methyltransferase enzymology to ""mark"" its DNA and it too has sophisticated development. What roles therefore is DNA methylation playing in different animals? The honey bee brings a fresh perspective to this question. Its combinatorial chemistry of pheromones, tergal and cuticular exudates provide an exquisite communication system between thousands of individuals. The development of queen and worker is strictly controlled by differential feeding of royal jelly and their adult behaviors are accompanied by epigenomic changes. Their interfaces with different ""environments"" are extensive, allowing an evaluation of the roles of epigenomes in behavior in a natural environment, in the space of a few weeks, and at requisite levels of experimental rigor. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Brain; Developmental canalization; DNA methylation; Epigenomics; Phenotypic polymorphism; Social insect",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952697268

It is the leading cause of senile dementia, characterized by neuronal degeneration and cognitive deteriorations, especially in the elderly. Intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) injection in rats’ brain provides a relevant model to sporadic dementia of Alzheimer type. Royal Jelly is a viscous substance produced by the young worker honey bees of the species, Apis mellifera. Earlier studies showed that RJ induces neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation. There are no reports so far showing if RJ has good effects on Alzheimer disease; thus in this study, we examined effect of RJ on learning and memory in rats after intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin. Methods: Forty eight male Wistar rats, each weighing 300-350 g, were used in the present study. The animals were divided in to four equal groups: sham, sham-royal jelly, streptozotocin, and streptozotocin- royal jelly. STZ and STZ–RJ groups received a bilateral ICV injection of STZ (1.5 mg/kg). Two other groups underwent the same surgical procedures, but same volume of saline was injected instead of STZ. Groups of sham-RJ and STZ-RJ was feed RJ-food (3% w/w) (lyophilized royal jelly mixed with powdered regular food) for a period of 10 days and groups of sham and streptozotocin was feed regular rats food in the same time. Learning and memory was analyzed by Morris water maze test and passive avoidance learning test. Finding: The results comes from passive avoidance learning test showed that learning and memory indices were significantly impaired in streptozotocin group respect to sham group, but there was not any significant difference between sham and streptozotocin-royal jelly groups. Although royal jelly improved learning and memory indices in sham-RJ group, but these changes were not significant. Conclusion: Intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (icv-STZ) was determined to cause adverse effects on learning and memory in rat. The administration of royal jelly to these animals alleviated the adverse effects of streptozotocin. The results of this research suggest that Royal Jelly may have good effect on prevent and attenuation of Alzheimer’s disease. © 2011, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences(IUMS).

However, recent findings suggest that spider crypsis plays a minor role in predator detection and some studies even showed that pollinators can become attracted to flowers harbouring Australian crab spider when the UV contrast between spider and flower increases. Here we studied the response of Apis mellifera honeybees to the presence of white or yellow Thomisus spectabilis Australian crab spiders sitting on Bidens alba inflorescences and also the response of honeybees to crab spiders that we made easily detectable painting blue their forelimbs or abdomen. To account for the visual systems of crab spider's prey, we measured the reflectance properties of the spiders and inflorescences used for the experiments. We found that honeybees did not respond to the degree of matching between spiders and inflorescences (either chromatic or achromatic contrast): They responded similarly to white and yellow spiders, to control and painted spiders. However spider UV reflection, spider size and spider movement determined honeybee behaviour: The probability that honeybees landed on spider-harbouring inflorescences was greatest when the spiders were large and had high UV reflectance or when spiders were small and reflected little UV, and honeybees were more likely to reject inflorescences if spiders moved as the bee approached the inflorescence. Our study suggests that only the large, but not the small Australian crab spiders deceive their preys by reflecting UV light, and highlights the importance of other cues that elicited an anti-predator response in honeybees. © 2011 Llandres, Rodríguez-Gironés.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951894372

Female larvae naturally develop into queens (reproductives) or workers (helpers) after being fed rich versus limited diets, respectively. Feeding larvae a rich diet mixed with dsRNA (double stranded RNA) targeting irs gene transcript decreased irs mRNA abundance and caused development of worker morphology.

Division of labor has been claimed to benefit fitness. In honey bees, the adult work force may be viewed as divided between non-foraging hive bees that rear brood and maintain the nest, and foragers that collect food outside the nest. Honey bee brood pheromone is a larval pheromone that serves as an excellent empirical tool to manipulate foraging behaviors and thus division of labor in the honey bee. Here we use two different doses of brood pheromone to alter the foraging stimulus environment, thus changing demographics of colony division of labor, to demonstrate how division of labor associated with brood rearing affects colony growth rate. We examine the effects of these different doses of brood pheromone on individual foraging ontogeny and specialization, colony level foraging behavior, and individual glandular protein synthesis. Low brood pheromone treatment colonies exhibited significantly higher foraging population, decreased age of first foraging and greater foraging effort, resulting in greater colony growth compared to other treatments.

However, changes in relative humidity and wind speed did not affect the number of individuals leaving the colony. The peak of flight activity was between 11:00 and 15:00 h.

Extracts of the body surface material with water and detergent were used for an in vitro analysis of the proteolytic activity and protease inhibitor level assaying, as well as for an electrophoretic separation of the extracts in polyacry-lamide gels. The following methods were used: protein content testing by the Lowry method (modified by Schacterle-Pollack), protease activity testing by the Anson method and protease inhibitor activity testing by the Lee and Lin method. Our studies revealed a high protease activity in an acidic environment (pH = 2.4; the material rinsed with detergent), as well as in neutral (pH = 7) and alkaline (pH = 11.2) environments (the material rinsed with water in both cases).

Two benchmark water distribution networks are considered in which the design variables are pipe diameters. Subsequently, the HBMO algorithm is applied to determine optimal discrete and continuous pipe sizes for the networks. Furthermore, to determine the effects of the roughness coefficient and minimum required nodal pressure on the HBMO algorithm performance, some additional information is presented to demonstrate those influences in the value of the final objective function as well as optimal pipe diameters. Moreover, in order to improve the performance of the search method, a combination of a local search algorithm with HBMO is tested in both examples. The hybrid algorithm consists of the modified Canda algorithm and pure HBMO which has had a better performance in both convergence rate and average objective functions found.

The four silk genes have been conserved for over 150 million years in all investigated bee, ant and hornet species, implying a distinct functional role for each protein. However, the amino acid composition and molecular architecture of the proteins are similar, suggesting functional redundancy. In this study we compare materials generated from a single honeybee silk protein to materials containing all four recombinant proteins or to natural honeybee silk. We analyse solution conformation by dynamic light scattering and circular dichroism, solid state structure by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, and fiber tensile properties by stress-strain analysis. The results demonstrate that fibers artificially generated from a single recombinant silk protein can reproduce the structural and mechanical properties of the natural silk. The importance of the four protein complex found in natural silk may lie in biological silk storage or hierarchical self-assembly. The finding that the functional properties of the mature material can be achieved with a single protein greatly simplifies the route to production for artificial honeybee silk. © 2011 Sutherland et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551618594

The Lagrange multiplier method, genetic algorithm, honey-bee mating optimisation and the NLP-GA hybrid are used to simultaneously optimise the minimum annualised investment cost of the pumping station and its annual operating cost. The solution includes selection of pump type, capacity, number of units and scheduling of pump operation. The hybrid algorithm takes advantage of the high speed of NLP as well as the intelligent searching of evolutionary algorithms to overcome the shortcomings of individual NLP and genetic algorithm methods such as trapping of local optima, reporting only local or near-global optimal solutions and the low convergence rate of evolutionary algorithms in this type of problem.

Here, we describe the adaptation of a 3D stereoscopic imaging method to measure the positional coordinates of individual agents in densely packed clusters. The method was applied to study behavioural aspects of shimmering in Giant honeybees, a collective defence behaviour that deters predatory wasps by visual cues, whereby individual bees flip their abdomen upwards in a split second, producing Mexican wave-like patterns.Results: Stereoscopic imaging provided non-invasive, automated, simultaneous, in-situ 3D measurements of hundreds of bees on the nest surface regarding their thoracic position and orientation of the body length axis. Segmentation was the basis for the stereo matching, which defined correspondences of individual bees in pairs of stereo images. Stereo-matched ""agent bees"" were re-identified in subsequent frames by the tracking procedure and triangulated into real-world coordinates. These algorithms were required to calculate the three spatial motion components (dx: horizontal, dy: vertical and dz: towards and from the comb) of individual bees over time.Conclusions: The method enables the assessment of the 3D positions of individual Giant honeybees, which is not possible with single-view cameras. The method can be applied to distinguish at the individual bee level active movements of the thoraces produced by abdominal flipping from passive motions generated by the moving bee curtain. The data provide evidence that the z-deflections of thoraces are potential cues for colony-intrinsic communication. The method helps to understand the phenomenon of collective decision-making through mechanoceptive synchronization and to associate shimmering with the principles of wave propagation. With further, minor modifications, the method could be used to study aspects of other mass phenomena that involve active and passive movements of individual agents in densely packed clusters. © 2011 Kastberger et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551683536

The results of hygienic evaluation demonstrated that 35% of Iranian honeybees are hygienic. For more research, different levels of hygienic behaviors were used as a treatment and then the selected 5th instar larva were transferred to fundamental colonies with 10 to 12% infestation. Three days later, the number of female Varroa in the capped cells were counted as attraction criteria for each treatment separately. The result demonstrated that hygienic colonies were fantastic because of their great interest for the least attraction. Moreover, the apparent correlation between resistant traits and performance traits exhibited that there are no significant relationship amongst resistance traits and performance traits. The relationship between uncapping and removing (which measured in the same recording day) was relatively high (>0.90). Furthermore, the correlation between hygienic behavior and attraction traits was negative so that the correlation between attraction and removing within 48 h after pouring liquid nitrogen was -0.86. The negative correlation between 2 major resistance traits (hygienic behavior and attraction traits) in the breeding stock deems that selection for resistance against Varroa mite and improved performance traits may be possible in the Iranian honeybees.

Any factor affecting the queen's fecundity will stagnate colony development, increasing its susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens. We discovered a pathology affecting the ovaries, characterized by a yellow discoloration concentrated in the apex of the ovaries resulting from degenerative lesions in the follicles. In extreme cases, marked by intense discoloration, the majority of the ovarioles were affected and these cases were universally associated with egg-laying deficiencies in the queens. Microscopic examination of the degenerated follicles showed extensive paracrystal lattices of 30 nm icosahedral viral particles. A cDNA library from degenerated ovaries contained a high frequency of deformed wing virus (DWV) and Varroa destructor virus 1 (VDV-1) sequences, two common and closely related honeybee Iflaviruses. These could also be identified by in situ hybridization in various parts of the ovary. A large-scale survey for 10 distinct honeybee viruses showed that DWV and VDV-1 were by far the most prevalent honeybee viruses in queen populations, with distinctly higher prevalence in mated queens (100% and 67%, respectively for DWV and VDV-1) than in virgin queens (37% and 0%, respectively). Since very high viral titres could be recorded in the ovaries and abdomens of both functional and deficient queens, no significant correlation could be made between viral titre and ovarian degeneration or egg-laying deficiency among the wider population of queens. Although our data suggest that DWV and VDV-1 have a role in extreme cases of ovarian degeneration, infection of the ovaries by these viruses does not necessarily result in ovarian degeneration, even at high titres, and additional factors are likely to be involved in this pathology. © 2011 Gauthier et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551546289

It acts via binding to G protein coupled receptors located on the plasma membrane of responsive cells. Several distinct subtypes of octopamine receptors have been found in invertebrates, yet little is known about the expression pattern of these different receptor subtypes and how each subtype may contribute to different behaviors. One honey bee (Apis mellifera) octopamine receptor, AmOA1, was recently cloned and characterized. Here we continue to characterize the AmOA1 receptor by investigating its distribution in the honey bee brain. We used two independent antibodies produced against two distinct peptides in the carboxyl-terminus to study the distribution of the AmOA1 receptor in the honey bee brain. We found that both anti-AmOA1 antibodies revealed labeling of cell body clusters throughout the brain and within the following brain neuropils: the antennal lobes; the calyces, pedunculus, vertical (alpha, gamma) and medial (beta) lobes of the mushroom body; the optic lobes; the subesophageal ganglion; and the central complex. Double immunofluorescence staining using anti-GABA and anti-AmOA1 receptor antibodies revealed that a population of inhibitory GABAergic local interneurons in the antennal lobes express the AmOA1 receptor in the cell bodies, axons and their endings in the glomeruli. In the mushroom bodies, AmOA1 receptors are expressed in a subpopulation of inhibitory GABAergic feedback neurons that ends in the visual (outer half of basal ring and collar regions) and olfactory (lip and inner basal ring region) calyx neuropils, as well as in the collar and lip zones of the vertical and medial lobes. The data suggest that one effect of octopamine via AmOA1 in the antennal lobe and mushroom body is to modulate inhibitory neurons. © 2011 Sinakevitch et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251549238

Social parasites are common in eusocial insects and tend to be close phylogenetic relatives of their hosts (= Emery's rule). Sympatric speciation caused by reproductive isolation between host and parasite is a possible evolutionary pathway. Socially parasitic workers of the Cape honeybee, Apis mellifera capensis, produce female clonal offspring parthenogenetically and invade colonies of the neighbouring subspecies A. m. scutellata. In the host colony, socially parasitic workers can become pseudoqueens, an intermediate caste with queenlike pheromone secretion. Here, we show that over an area of approximately 275.000 km2, all parasitic workers bear the genetic signature of a clone founded by a single ancestral worker genotype. Any gene flow from the host to the parasite is impossible because honeybee workers cannot mate. Gene flow from the parasite to the host is possible, as parasitic larvae can develop into queens. However, we show that despite sympatric coexistence for more than a decade, gene flow between host and social parasite (Fst = 0.32) and hybridizations (0.71%) are rare, resulting in reproductive isolation. Our data suggest a new barrier to gene flow in sympatry, which is not based on assortative matings but on thelytoky and reproductive division of labour in eusocial insects, thereby suggesting a new potential pathway to Emery's rule. © 2010 The Authors.

Octopamine induced a biphasic effect on the frequency and force of cardiac contractions acting as an agonist, with a strong acceleratory effect, at concentrations higher than 10 -12M for the honeybee and higher than 50×10 -9M for the olive fruit fly. The heart of the honeybee is far more sensitive than the heart of olive fruit fly. This unusual sensitivity is extended to the blockers of octopaminergic receptors, where phentolamine at 10 -5M stopped the spontaneous contractions of the honeybee heart completely and permanently, while the same blocker at the same concentration caused only 50% inhibition in the heart of the olive fruit fly. Phentolamine and mianserin at low concentrations of 10 -7M also blocked the heart octopaminergic receptors, but for a short period of time, of less than 15.0min, while a partial recovery in heart contraction started in spite of the presence of the antagonist. The unusual response of the honeybee heart in the presence of phentolamine and/or mianserin suggests excitatory effects of octopamine via two different receptor subtypes. At lower concentrations, 10 -14M, the agonist octopamine was converted to an antagonist, inducing a hyperpolarization in the membrane potential of the honeybee cardiac pacemaker cells and inhibiting the firing rate of the heart. The inhibitory effects of octopamine on certain parameters of the rhythmic bursts of the heart of the honeybee, were similar to those of mianserin and phentolamine, typical blockers of octopaminergic receptors. The heart of the olive fruit fly was 10 5 times less sensitive to octopamine, since a persistent inhibition of heart contractions occurred at 10 -9M. In conclusion, the acceleration of the insect heart is achieved by increasing the levels of octopamine, while there is a passive but also an active decrease in heart activity due to the minimization of octopamine. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Biphasic; Excitation; Heart; Honeybee; Inhibition; Octopamine; Phentolamine",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651454387

Nosema disease has a global distribution and is responsible for considerable economic losses among apiculturists. In this study, 336 honeybee samples from 18 different prefectures in Japan were examined for the presence of N. apis and N. ceranae using a PCR technique. Although N. ceranae was not detected in most of the apiaries surveyed, the parasite was detected at three of the sites examined. Further, N. ceranae appears to be patchily distributed across Japan and no apparent geographic difference was observed among the areas surveyed. In addition, the apparent absence of N. apis suggests that N. ceranae may be displacing N. apis in A. mellifera in Japan. Partial SSU rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed the possible existence of two N. ceranae groups from different geographic regions in Japan. It seems likely that these microsporidian parasites were introduced into Japan through the importation of either contaminated honeybee-related products or infected queens. This study confirmed that PCR detection is effective for indicating the presence of this pathogen in seemingly healthy colonies. It is therefore hoped that the results presented here will improve our understanding of the epidemiology of Nosema disease so that effective controls can be implemented. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Apis mellifera; Microsporidia; Nosema apis; Nosema ceranae",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78751585245

To do this, honey bee larvae reared in an incubator were exposed to one of nine pesticides: chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid, amitraz, fluvalinate, coumaphos, myclobutanil, chlorothalonil, glyphosate and simazine. Following this, larvae were fixed and prepared for immunohistologically detected cellular death using two TUNEL techniques for DNA fragmentation labeling and Annexin V to detect the localization of exposed PS specific in situ binding to apoptotic cells. Untreated larvae experienced ∼10% midgut apoptotic cell death under controlled conditions. All applied pesticides triggered an increase in apoptosis in treated compared to untreated larvae. The level of cell death in the midgut of simazine-treated larvae was highest at 77% mortality and statistically similar to the level of cell death for chlorpyrifos (65%), imidacloprid (61%), myclobutanil (69%), and glyphosate (69%) treated larvae. Larvae exposed to fluvalinate had the lowest midgut columnar apoptotic cell death (30%) of any pesticide-treated larvae. Indications of elevated apoptotic cell death in salivary glands and ovaries after pesticide application were detected. Annexin V localization, indicative of apoptotic cell deletion, had an extensive distribution in the midgut, salivary glands and ovaries of pesticide-treated larvae. The data suggest that the tested pesticides induced apoptosis in tissues of honey bee larvae at the tested concentrations. Cell death localization as a tool for a monitoring the subclinical and sub-lethal effects of external influences on honey bee larval tissues is discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Apis mellifera; Cell death; Fungicide; Herbicide; Immunohistology; Insecticide; TUNEL",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78751703703

There is a consensus that pathogens are among the key players in this alarming demise of the most important commercial pollinator. One of the pathogens heavily implicated in colony losses is deformed wing virus (DWV). Overt DWV infections manifested as deformed-wing syndrome started to become a threat to honeybees only in the wake of the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor, which horizontally transmits DWV. However, a direct causal link between the virus and the symptom 'wing deformity' has not been established yet. To evaluate the impact of different horizontal transmission routes, and especially the role of the mite in the development of overt DWV infections, we performed laboratory infection assays with pupae and adult bees. We could demonstrate that pupae injected with DWV dose-dependently developed overt infections characterized by deformed wings in adult bees, suggesting that DWV, if transmitted to pupae by the mite, is the causative agent of the deformed-wing syndrome. The OID50 (overt infection dosage) was approximately 2500 genome equivalents. Injecting more than 1×10 7 DWV genome equivalents into adult bees also resulted in overt infections while the same viral dosage fed to adult bees only resulted in covert infections. Therefore, both infection of adult bees through DWV-transmitting phoretic mites and infection of nurse bees through their cannibalizing DWV-infected pupae might represent possible horizontal transmission routes of DWV. © 2011 SGM.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251517091

Consensus now seems to be that pathogens and parasites (e.g. the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor, the microsporidium Nosema ceranae and viruses) play a major role in this demise. However, little is known about host-pathogen interactions for bee pathogens and attempts to develop novel strategies to combat bee diseases have been hampered by this gap in our knowledge. One reason for this dire situation is the complete lack of cell cultures for the propagation and study of bee pathogens. Here we present a cell culture model for two honey bee-pathogenic microsporidian species, Nosema apis and N. ceranae. Our cell culture system is based on a lepidopteran cell line, which proved to be susceptible to infection by both N. ceranae and N. apis and enabled us to illustrate the entire life cycle of these microsporidia. We observed hitherto undescribed spindle-shaped meronts and confirmed our findings in infected bees.

Bees are a monophyletic group of Hymenoptera that transitioned to a completely herbivorous diet from the carnivorous diet of their wasp ancestors. Recent culture-independent studies suggest that a set of distinctive bacterial species inhabits the gut of the honey bee, Apis mellifera. Here we survey the gut microbiotae of diverse bee and wasp species to test whether acquisition of these bacteria was associated with the transition to herbivory in bees generally. We found that most bee species lack phylotypes that are the same or similar to those typical of A. mellifera, rejecting the hypothesis that this dietary transition was symbiont-dependent. The most common bacteria in solitary bee species are a widespread phylotype of Burkholderia and the pervasive insect associate, Wolbachia. In contrast, several social representatives of corbiculate bees do possess distinctive bacterial phylotypes. Samples of A. mellifera harboured the same microbiota as in previous surveys, and closely related bacterial phylotypes were identified in two Asian honey bees (Apis andreniformis and Apis dorsata) and several bumble bee (Bombus) species. Potentially, the sociality of Apis and Bombus species facilitates symbiont transmission and thus is key to the maintenance of a more consistent gut microbiota.

Nosema ceranae is a Microsporidian recently described as a parasite of Apis mellifera honeybees and is currently considered the aetiological agent of an emergent illness named nosemosis type C. In this article we evaluate the role of a bird species, the European bee-eater, Merops apiaster, as a large-scale dispersive agent of N. ceranae. We found a high prevalence of viable spores of N. ceranae in pellets regurgitated by bee-eaters in different locations in the Iberian Peninsula, Central Europe and central Asia. In contrast, spores of Nosema apis, considered till recently the most common microsporidium infecting honeybees, were detected in a single locality and Nosema bombi spores were not noticed. Since non-viable spores were also found in bee-eater nests from different locations, this bird species could also reduce the fraction of infected insects by withdrawing pathogens from the colonies. We conclude that bee-eater mobility and migration may have played an important role in the transmission of the pathogen N. ceranae. © 2010 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650797440

Arthropods have long served as model systems to study such associations, especially since Paul Buchner's (1965) seminal work that beautifully illustrated the enormous diversity of microorganisms associated with insects. Particularly high taxonomic and functional diversities of microbial symbionts have been found in the guts and gut-associated organs of insects. These microorganisms play important roles in the digestion, nutrition and defence of the host. However, most studies of gut microorganisms have focused on single host taxa, limiting the ability to draw general conclusions on composition and functional roles of the insect gut microbiota. This is especially true for the diverse and important insect order Hymenoptera that comprises the bees, wasps and ants. Recently, Russell (2009) analysed the bacterial community associated with diverse ant species and found evidence for changes in the microbial gut community coinciding with the evolution of herbivory. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Martinson (2011) provide the first broad-scale bacterial survey for bees. Their findings substantiate earlier evidence for a surprisingly simple gut microbiota in honeybees (Apis mellifera) that is composed of only six to ten major phylotypes. Importantly, Martinson et al. demonstrate for the first time that the same bacterial phylotypes are major constituents of other Apis as well as Bombus species, but not of any other bees and wasps outside of the corbiculate bees, a clade of four tribes within the subfamily Apinae. These results indicate that corbiculate bees harbour a specific and possibly co-evolved bacterial community in their digestive tract. Furthermore, the comparison with other bees and wasps suggests that changes in social lifestyle may have had a stronger effect on the evolution of the gut microbiota than the dietary shift from predatory ancestors to pollen-feeding (i.e. herbivorous) species.

However, linkage among species is mediated by their constituting individuals. Thus, every linked species pair in a network encapsulates a new network of interacting individuals. Very few studies outside the sociology of larger animals have investigated networks at the level of the individual. Here, we analyse the structure of a flower-visitation network of individual thistles Cirsium arvense and honeybees Apis mellifera in a small meadow patch in Denmark. We marked and numbered 62 honeybees and 32 thistle stems and monitored all floral visits. The constructed bipartite network of individual plants and bees had a high connectance and low nestedness, but it was not significantly modular. Frequency distributions of number of links per species (i.e. linkage level) had their best fit to a truncated power law, and interactions were asymmetrical. Unipartite networks of either plants or bees had exceedingly short average path length and high clustering. Linkage level of plants increased with their number of flower heads and height of inflorescence (floral display parameters). Overall, the individual network of honeybees and thistles was denser linked than what is known from species pollination networks. Characteristics of both plants (e.g. floral display) and animals (e.g. foraging behaviour) are likely to generate this intra-specific, inter-individual link pattern. Such features of individual-individual networks may scale up and become important drivers of the structure and dynamics of species-species networks. © 2011 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78751619238

As life expectancy continues to increase because of reduced death rates among elderly, the beneficial role of social relationships is emerging as a cross-cutting theme in research on aging and healthspan. There is a need to improve knowledge on how behavior shapes, and is shaped by, the social environment, as well as needs to identify and study biological mechanisms that can translate differences in the social aspects of behavioral efforts, relationships, and stress reactivity (the general physiological and behavioral response-pattern to harmful, dangerous or unpleasant situations) into variation in aging. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) provide a genetic model in sociobiology, behavioral neuroscience, and gerontology that is uniquely sensitive to social exchange. Different behavioral contact between these social insects can shorten or extend lifespan more than 10-fold, and some aspects of their senescence are reversed by social cues that trigger aged individuals to express youthful repertoires of behavior. Here, I summarize how variation in social interactions contributes to this plasticity of aging and explain how beneficial and detrimental roles of social relationships can be traced from environmental and biological effects on honey bee physiology and behavior, to the expression of recovery-related plasticity, stress reactivity, and survival during old age. This system provides intriguing opportunities for research on aging. © 2010 The Author.

We use simulated hornet attacks and a combination of video recordings and image analysis to reveal, for the first time, contrasted intra-subspecies defensive tactics that operate at the colony level during predation. In some colonies, when attacked, the numbers of guards at the hive entrance increases rapidly to attack, engulf, and kill invading hornets. In other colonies, guards avoid conflicts with hornets by retreating gradually and by forming a defensive line of honeybees at the hive entrance. Retreater colonies have propolis walls at the hive entrances with small apertures that are too narrow to allow the hornet to access the hive and that therefore reinforces entrance protection. On the contrary, attacker colonies have propolis walls with large openings through which the hornet can pass; these bees block the hornet's access by intensively guarding the hive entrance. We experimentally destroy propolis walls to test whether colonies consistently rebuild walls with the same intrinsic characteristics and we also monitor the survival rate of each anti-predator tactic after massive natural predation by hornets. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Anti-predator tactics; Apis mellifera cypria; Defensive behaviour; Propolis walls; Vespa orientalis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551687494

To investigate the response of adult A. tumida to visual stimuli, we tested the influence of color and height on trap efficiency. Two pole trap colors (black and white) were evaluated at three heights (46 cm, 1 m, and 3 m) from October 2008 to December 2009. A. tumida were trapped in the greatest numbers between 17 April and 15 May 2009. The lowest numbers were captured during the winter and fall. The trapping results showed that both color and trap height significantly influenced capture. The average catch in the white traps (mean ± SE, 2.47 ± 0.30) was significantly higher than that of the black traps (1.53 ± 0.29) probably because white is more reflective than black. Among the heights evaluated, there were more beetles caught when traps were positioned at 46 cm (the same height as the entrance of the hives) with 3.07 ± 0.51 beetles compared with beetles captured at 1 m (1.88 ± 0.30) or 3 m (1.06 ± 0.18) high. Male and female beetles exhibited similar responses to trap color and height. The relationship between the numbers of beetles in colonies and capture rates in traps was very poor and did not provide a basis to evaluate trap efficiency. In addition, because capture rates seemed generally low in relationship to the number of beetles in the apiary, substantial improvements to the trap may be necessary.","Aethina tumida; in-hive traps; out-hive traps; polyvinyl chloride trap; white trap",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952180097

Instead, honeybee vitellogenin (180kDa) participates in processes other than reproduction: it influences hormone signaling, food-related behavior, immunity, stress resistance and longevity. The molecular basis of these functions is largely unknown. Here, we establish and compare the molecular properties of vitellogenin from honeybee hemolymph (blood) and abdominal fat body, two compartments that are linked to vitellogenin functions. Our results reveal a novel 40kDa vitellogenin fragment in abdominal fat body tissue, the main site for vitellogenin synthesis and storage. Using MALDI-TOF combined with MS/MS mass-spectroscopy, we assign the 40kDa fragment to the N terminus of vitellogenin, whereas a previously observed 150kDa fragment corresponded to the remainder of the protein. We show that both protein units are N glycosylated and phosphorylated. Focusing on the novel 40kDa fragment, we present a homology model based on the structure of lamprey lipovitellin that includes a conserved β-barrel-like shape, with a lipophilic cavity in the interior and two insect-specific loops that have not been described before. Our data indicate that the honeybee fat body vitellogenin experiences cleavage unlike hemolymph vitellogenin, a pattern that can suggest a tissue-specific role. Our experiments advance the molecular understanding of vitellogenin, of which the multiple physiological and behavioral effects in honeybees are well established. © 2011.

However, in reality this simple prediction is often confounded by several complications observed in natural systems. Motivated by recent findings in the Cape honey bee and in the parasitoid wasp Lysiphlebus fabarum, we explore through mathematical models the spread of a recessive, parthenogenesis inducing allele in a haplodiploid population. The focus of these models is on the intricate interactions between the mode of parthenogenesis induction through automixis and complementary sex determination (CSD) systems. These interactions may result in asexual production of diploid male offspring and the spread of the parthenogenesis-inducing allele through these males. We demonstrate that if parthenogenetic females produce a substantial proportion of male offspring, this may prevent the parthenogenesis-inducing allele from spreading. However, this effect is weakened if these diploid males are at least partially fertile. We also predict a degradation of multilocus CSD systems during the spread of parthenogenesis, following which only a single polymorphic CSD locus is maintained.

Interactions with other organisms on one side of the soil surface may have impacts that extend across this boundary. Although our understanding of plant-herbivore interactions is derived largely from studies of leaf herbivory, belowground root herbivores may affect plant fitness directly or by altering interactions with other organisms, such as pollinators. In this study, we investigated the effects of leaf herbivory, root herbivory, and pollination on plant growth, subsequent leaf herbivory, flower production, pollinator attraction, and reproduction in cucumber (Cucumis sativus). We manipulated leaf and root herbivory with striped cucumber beetle (Acalymma vittatum) adults and larvae, respectively, and manipulated pollination with supplemental pollen. Both enhanced leaf and root herbivory reduced plant growth, and leaf herbivory reduced subsequent leaf damage. Plants with enhanced root herbivory produced 35% fewer female flowers, while leaf herbivory had no effect on flower production. While leaf herbivory reduced the time that honey bees spent probing flowers by 29%, probing times on root-damaged plants were over twice as long as those on control plants. Root herbivory increased pollen limitation for seed production in spite of increased honey bee preference for plants with root damage. Leaf damage and hand-pollination treatments had no effect on fruit production, but plants with enhanced root damage produced 38% fewer fruits that were 25% lighter than those on control plants. Despite the positive effect of belowground damage on honey bee visitation, root herbivory had a stronger negative effect on plant reproduction than leaf herbivory. These results demonstrate that the often-overlooked effects of belowground herbivores may have profound effects on plant performance. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Acalymma vittatum; Cucumis sativus; Indirect effects; Pollinator visitation; Root herbivory",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651426670

Honey bees are a classic example and maintain their thoracic muscles at temperatures (Tth) tuned to the caloric benefits of floral resources. Using infrared thermography, we tested the hypothesis that forager motivation to recruit nestmates for a food source is positively correlated with Tth. We trained bees to a sucrose feeder located 5-100?m from the nest. Recruiting foragers had a significantly higher average Tth (2.7°C higher) when returning from 2.5?mol?l-1 sucrose (65% w/w) than when returning from 1.0?mol?l-1 sucrose (31% w/w). Foragers exhibited significantly larger thermal fluctuations the longer they spent inside the nest between foraging trips. The difference between maximum and minimum temperatures during a nest visit (Trange) increased with total duration of the nest visit (0.7°C increase per additional min spent inside the nest). Bees that recruited nestmates (waggle or round danced) were significantly warmer, with a 1.4-1.5 times higher ΔTth (difference between Tth and nest ambient air temperature) than bees who tremble danced or simply walked on the nest floor without recruiting between foraging bouts. However, recruiter Tth was not correlated with finer-scale measures of motivation: the number of waggle dance circuits or waggle dance return phase duration. These results support the hypothesis that forager Tth within the nest is correlated to broad-scale differences in foraging motivation. © 2011 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.","Foraging; Heterothermy; Honey bee; Recruitment; Thermoregulation; Waggle dance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251477576

From the year 2000 the number of isolates of P. larvae resistant against Oxytetracycline (OTC) has increased. Therefore, since 2000 many antibiotics, chemotherapeutic propolis and plant extracts were tested in vitro and in vivo against P. larvae. The most active in the in vitro tests appeared to be deoxycycline, minocycline, rifampicin and lincomycin. Among the 35 examined antibacterial compounds active against P. larvae were narasin, salinomycin and tylosine. In many countries tylosine, tilomycosis have been recommended for the control of AFB, while microsamicine was recommended in Japan. The studies with plain essential oils did not succeeded. The propolis extracts from the various parts of the world showed significant inhibition of P. larvae. Due to the evolution of the resistance of P. larvae to conventional antibiotic treatments, the research on normal bee microflora (Bacillus, Paenibacillus, and Brevibacillus) is an important step in identifying possible new active tools to treat AFB in honey bee colonies.","Antibacterial drugs; Control of AFB; Paenibacillus larvae",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952412526

Its composition depends on the vegetation, the season, and the source area. It usually contains many chemical compounds such as polyphenols, steroids and amino acids. The hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a type of anaemia characterized by microcytic and hyperchromic red cells, spherical in shape and without central pallor. Clinically, subjects present from asymptomatic conditions to severe haemolytic anaemia. In this study it was evaluated the effect of two propolis extracts in the osmotic fragility of HS patient red blood cell (RBC) membrane. It was found that propolis decreases the erythrocytes membrane fragility, being the effect of Bornes propolis more pronounced than Fundão propolis'. This effect was related with the higher phenolic content of the former propolis. The results obtained in vitro suggest that the membrane fragility increases under oxidative stress conditions for the patient RBC's and the protection effect of propolis is due to its antioxidant properties. These results open doors for future investigations in order to elucidate the mechanisms, identify the main compounds involved in this fragility protection of the erythrocyte membrane.

To test the applicability of the algorithm, results are compared with those from different analytical and evolutionary algorithms (linear programming, dynamic programming, differential dynamic programming, discrete differential dynamic programming and genetic algorithm). The first example is a multireservoir operation optimisation problem in a discrete domain with discrete decision and state variables. It is shown that the performance of the model compares well with results of the well-developed genetic algorithm. The second example is a four-reservoir problem in a continuous domain that has recently been approached with different evolutionary algorithms. The third example is a ten-reservoir problem in series and parallel. The best solution obtained is quite comparable with the linear programming solution, and slightly better than the best result reported by other investigators using genetic algorithms. In all three cases, convergence of the solutions in different runs to near-global optima and its rapid convergence rate compared to genetic algorithm demonstrates the applicability and efficiency of the proposed algorithm in solving water-resource optimisation problems in both discrete and continuous domains.","Hydrology &; Water resource/water supply",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551612330

The Hymenoptera are one of the most behaviorally complex insect orders, and the olfactory system of honeybees (one of the most derived members) has been extensively studied. To understand the context in which the olfactory system of the Hymenoptera evolved, we performed a variety of immunocytochemical and anatomical labeling techniques on the antennal lobes (ALs) of one of its most primitive members, the sawflies, to provide a comparison between the honeybee and other insect model species. The olfactory receptor neurons project from the antennae to fill the entire glomerular volume but do not form distinct tracts as in the honeybee. Labeling of projection neurons revealed 5 output tracts similar to those in moths and immunolabeling for several transmitters revealed distinct populations of local interneurons and centrifugal neurons that were also similar to moths. There were, however, no histaminergic or dopaminergic AL neurons. The similarities between sawflies and moths suggest that along with the great radiation and increased complexity of behavioral repertoire of the Hymenoptera, there were extensive modifications of AL structure. © The Author 2010.

To study fundamental evolutionary questions at the genomic level, a high resolution genetic linkage map is an essential tool for analyses ranging from quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to genome assembly and comparative genomics. We here present a saturated linkage map and match it with the Apis mellifera genome using homologous markers. This genome-wide comparison allows insights into structural conservations and rearrangements and thus the evolution on a chromosomal level.Results: The high density linkage map covers ~ 93% of the B. terrestris genome on 18 linkage groups (LGs) and has a length of 2'047 cM with an average marker distance of 4.02 cM. Based on a genome size of ~ 430 Mb, the recombination rate estimate is 4.76 cM/Mb. Sequence homologies of 242 homologous markers allowed to match 15 B. terrestris with A. mellifera LGs, five of them as composites. Comparing marker orders between both genomes we detect over 14% of the genome to be organized in synteny and 21% in rearranged blocks on the same homologous LG.Conclusions: This study demonstrates that, despite the very high recombination rates of both A. mellifera and B. terrestris and a long divergence time of about 100 million years, the genomes' genetic architecture is highly conserved. This reflects a slow genome evolution in these bees. We show that data on genome organization and conserved molecular markers can be used as a powerful tool for comparative genomics and evolutionary studies, opening up new avenues of research in the Apidae. © 2011 Stolle et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651484927

In an attempt to detect potential virulence factors secreted by P. larvae, we identified an enolase among different secreted proteins. Although this protein is a cytosolic enzyme involved in glycolytic pathways, it has been related to virulence. The aim of the present work was to evaluate its role during the infection of honeybee larvae. Toxicity assays showed that enolase was highly toxic and immunogenic to honeybee larvae. Its production was detected inside P. larvae vegetative cells, on the surface of P. larvae spores and secreted to the external growth medium. P. larvae enolase production was also confirmed in vivo, during the infection of honeybee larvae. This protein was able to hydrolyze milk proteins as described for P. larvae, suggesting that could be involved in larval degradation, maybe through the plasmin(ogen) system. These results suggest that P. larvae enolase may have a role in virulence and could contribute to a general insight about insect-pathogen interaction mechanisms. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","American foulbrood; Enolase; Paenibacillus larvae",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649498398

The loss of flora and fauna includes economically and socially important insects. Honey bees and silk moths, grouped under commercial insects, are the source for insect-based enterprises that provide income to forest-edge communities to manage the ecosystem. However, to date, research output does not adequately quantify the impact of such enterprises on buffering forest ecosystems and communities from climate change effects. Although diseases/pests of honey bees and silk moths in Africa have risen to epidemic levels, there is a dearth of practical research that can be utilized in developing effective control mechanisms that port the proliferation of these commercial insects as pollinators of agricultural and forest ecosystems. This review highlights the critical role of commercial insects within the environmental complexity of African forest ecosystems, in modern agroindustry, and with respect to its potential contribution to poverty alleviation and pollination services. It identifies significant research gaps that exist in understanding how insects can be utilized as ecosystem health indicators and nurtured as integral tools for important socioeconomic and industrial gains. © 2011 by Annual Reviews.

The highly complex social organization of honeybees is mediated through pheromones. Releaser pheromones cause rapid changes in the behaviour of the recipient, while primer pheromones have relatively slow and long-term effects on the physiology and behaviour of the recipient. Queen retinue pheromone (QRP) is a blend of the nine compounds (9-oxo-(E)-2-decenoic acid, (R)- and (S)-9-hydroxy-(E)-2-decenoic acid, methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, 4-hydroxy-3-methyoxyphenylethanol, methyl oleate, coniferyl alcohol, palmityl alcohol, and linolenic acid) and acts as a releaser pheromone by attracting worker bees to the queen. QRP also acts as a primer pheromone by physiologically inhibiting the ovary development of worker bees. An essential component of QRP, 9-oxo-(E)-2-decenoic acid, acts as a long-distance sex pheromone. Defensive behaviour of honeybees is induced and modulated by alarm pheromones. The essential alarm pheromone component is isopentyl acetate (IPA). The unsaturated derivative of IPA, 3-methyl-2-buten-1-yl acetate, was found in colonies of Africanized honeybees. The Nasanov gland of worker bees produces a pheromone (a blend of nerol, geraniol, (E)- and (Z)-citral, nerolic acid, geranic acid and (E, E)-farnesol) that acts as an attracting signal. This pheromone is used for aggregation (during swarming). Adult worker bees also produce a substance, ethyl oleate, that has a priming effect. Ethyl oleate is produced by adult forager bees and acts as a chemical inhibitory factor to delay age at onset of foraging (the presence of older worker bees causes a delayed onset of foraging in younger individuals). Chemical cues on the surface of larvae called a brood pheromone (ethyl and methyl esters of palmitic, linoleic, linolenic, stearic, and oleic acids, E-β-ocimene) are important in the communication between brood and worker bees. This pheromone modulates the feeding behaviour of worker bees, inhibits the activation of the worker ovary, induces worker bees to cap brood cells, increases the activity of the hypopharyngeal glands of nurse bees and modulates the behavioural maturation of worker bees. © 2012 Veterinarni Medicina.","Brood; Drone; Interaction; Pheromone; Queen; Worker bee",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960999663

The function of these candidate genes does not seem to support a higher olfactory sensitivity in hygienic bees, as previously hypothesized.

Infected larvae die when they are stretched in the cap cell and suffer a gradual hardening that ends in a very hard structure (mummie). Several studies have demonstrated that colonies that express an efficient hygienic behaviour (uncapping of cell and subsequent removal of dead brood) exhibit a higher resistance to the disease. However, it remains unclear whether the advantage of hygienic colonies over less hygienic ones lies in the ability to remove mummies or in the early detection of infected larvae and its cannibalization before they harden. To elucidate this aspect, the hygienic behaviour of 24 colonies, which were subsequently provided with pollen cakes containig a. apis, was evaluated. The number of mummies and the number of partially cannibalized and whole larvae in uncapped cells were recorded. The most hygienic colonies controlled the disease better. These colonies also had a higher tendency to uncap cells that contained infected larvae and cannibalize them. The presence of a. apis in partially cannibalized and whole larvae in uncapped cells indicate that the advantage of hygienic colonies over less hygienic ones lies in the early detection of infected larvae death and their quick removal from the cell before they become mummies. © 2011 Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.","Ascosphaera apis; Honey bee; Larva; Selection",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952939086

The local reactions observed after the envenoming includes typical inflammatory response and pain. Several studies have been performed to identify the substances, including peptides that are responsible for such phenomena. The aim of the present study is to characterize the possible nociceptive (hyperalgesic) and edematogenic effects of some peptides isolated from the venoms of the honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the social wasps Polybia paulista and Protonectarina sylveirae, in addition to characterize some of the mechanisms involved in these phenomena. For this purpose, different doses of the peptides mellitin (Apis mellifera), Polybia-MP-I, N-2-Polybia-MP-I (Polybia paulista), Protonectarina-MP-NH2 and Protonectarina-MP-OH (Protonectarina sylveirae) were injected into the hind paw of mice. Hyperalgesia and edema were determined after peptide application, by using an electronic von Frey apparatus and a paquimeter. Carrageenin and saline were used as controls. Results showed that melittin, Polybia-MP-I, N-2-Polybia-MP-I, Protonectarina-MP-NH2 and Protonectarina-MP-OH peptides produced a dose- and time-related hyperalgesic and edematogenic responses. Both phenomena are detected 2 h after melittin, Polybia-MP-I, N-2-Polybia-MP-I injection; their effects lasted until 8 h. In order to evaluate the role of prostanoids and the involvement of lipidic mediators in hyperalgesia induced by the peptides, indomethacin and zileuton were used. Results showed that zileuton blocked peptide-induced hyperalgesia and induced a decrease of the edematogenic response. On the other hand, indomethacin did not interfere with these phenomena. These results indicate that melittin, Polybia-MP-I, N-2-Polybia-MP-I, Protonectarina-MP-NH2, and Protonectarina-MP-OH peptides could contribute to inflammation and pain induced by insect venoms. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Hyperalgesia; Inflammation; Peptides; Polybia paulista; Protonectarina sylveirae",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78751585263

On day 7 post-emergence, bees from each diet treatment were individually infected with 4.60 × 104, 2.30 × 105 or 1.15 × 106 spores of N. ceranae, keeping later on the same diet.

When bees are fed on pollen, however, the parasite develops quickly, exhibiting significantly higher intensities than under other treatments. The longevity of infected bees fed on the same diet was not affected by the degree of parasitism, but by the quality of the ad libitum diet administered. The data demonstrate a parasite development that depends on host-condition.

However, the question whether it also affects learning and memory remained unanswered. To address this question, we studied the effect of circadian timing on olfactory learning and memory in honey bees Apis mellifera using the olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex paradigm. Bees were differentially conditioned to odours and tested for their odour learning at four different ""Zeitgeber"" time points. We show that learning behaviour is influenced by circadian timing. Honey bees perform best in the morning compared to the other times of day. Additionally, we found influences of the light condition bees were trained at on the olfactory learning. This circadian-mediated learning is independent from feeding times bees were entrained to, indicating an inherited and not acquired mechanism. We hypothesise that a co-evolutionary mechanism between the honey bee as a pollinator and plants might be the driving force for the evolution of the time-dependent learning abilities of bees. © 2010 The Author(s).","Circadian; Honey bee; Learning; Olfaction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651479728

The effect of wind velocity on avocado-flower pollen under laboratory conditions was also studied. Rates of pollination showed highly positive correlations with honeybee density, whereas no correlations were observed with wind velocity. Under laboratory conditions, no effect of wind velocities equivalent to those measured in the field was observed on avocado-flower pollen. Our results agree with earlier work in which wind contributed only slightly to avocado yield. Hence, we conclude that contrasting data which show the effectiveness of wind pollination in avocado are not relevant to most avocado-growing regions, including Israel and California.

Amsima, Amtango and Amfatiga showed correlated transcriptional activity, with two peaks of occurring in both queens and workers, the first one shortly after the last larval molt and the second during the cocoon-spinning phase. Transcript levels for the three genes were consistently higher in workers. As there is no evidence for major microenvironmental differences in oxygen levels within the brood nest area, this appears to be an inherent caste character. Quantitative PCR analyses on worker brain, ovary, and leg imaginal discs showed that these tissues differ in transcript levels. Being a highly conserved pathway and linked to IIS/TOR, the hypoxia gene expression pattern seen in honey bee larvae denotes that the hypoxia pathway has undergone a transformation, at least during larval development, from a response to environmental oxygen concentrations to an endogenous regulatory factor in the diphenic development of honey bee larvae. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Caste development; HIF; Honeybee; Hypoxia inducible factor; Insulin signaling",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650214952

We assayed queens from various commercial sources for various measures of potential queen quality, including their physical characters (such as their degree of parasitism), insemination number (stored sperm counts), and effective paternity frequency (number of drone fathers among their offspring). We found significant variation in the physical, insemination, and mating quality of commercially produced queens, and we detected significant correlations within and among these various measures. Overall, the queens were sufficiently inseminated (3.99 ± 1.504 million sperm) and mated with an appropriate number of drones (effective paternity frequency: 16.0 ± 9.48). Importantly, very few of the queens were parasitized by tracheal mites and none were found with either Nosema species. These findings suggest possible mechanisms for assessing the potential fitness of honey bee queens without the need for destructive sampling. © INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences, 2010.","Efective mating frequency; Honey bee queens; Insemination; Parasitism; Reproductive potential",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955517921

With the purpose of detecting the possible existence of populations of resistant mites to the fluvalinate in the State of Yucatan, one of the main honey producer states in Mexico, 12 samples were gathered from each apiary, selecting four apiaries where fluvalinate was used in constant way for the control of V. destructor during five years, and a similar quantity of samples coming from apiaries where methods of alternative control have been used during a similar time. To determine from the mites the percentage of mortality to the fluvalinate, they were exposed to a piece of 2.5 x 1.0 cm from Apistan® at 10%, during 24 h. The percentage of mortality of varroas coming from apiaries treated in a constant way with fluvalinate was of 83.6 ± 0.51 %, lower to the percentage of mortality obtained in apiaries that only received alternative treatment which was of 93.9 ± 1.98 %, existing differences between both groups (t=-3.93, P=0.01, gl= 46), This means a reduction in the percentage of mortality obtained with the fluvalinate. However, this reduction still does not reach the necessary levels that can define the presence of resistant mites, being important to change the practices that seem to reduce the levels of infestation of V. destructor.

We analysed the presence and localization of cadherins in ovaries of honeybee queens and in testes of drones. Transcripts representing two classical cadherins, E-cadherin (shotgun) and N-cadherin, as well as three protocadherins (Starry night, Fat and Fat-like) were detected in gonads of both sexes. Pan-cadherin antibodies, which most probably detect a honeybee N-cadherin, were used in immunolocalization analyses. In the germarium of ovarioles, cadherin-IR (cadherin immunoreactivity) was evidenced as homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm and as nuclear foci, in both germline and somatic cells. It was also detected in polyfusomes and ring canals. In testiolar tubules, cadherin-IR showed a cytoplasmic and nuclear distributon alike in ovaries. The unexpected nuclear localization and cytoplasmic distribution in ovaries and testes were corroborated by immunogold electron microscopy, which revealed cadherin aggregates associated with electron-dense nuclear structures. With respect to cadherin localization, the honeybee differs from Drosophila, the model for gametogenesis in insects, raising the question as to how differences among solitary and social species may be built into and generated from the general architecture of polytrophic meroistic ovaries. It also indicates the possibility of divergent roles for cadherin in the functional architecture of insect gonads, in general, especially in taxa with high reproductive output. © The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2011 Portland Press Limited.","Honeybee; N-cadherin; Ovary; Social insect; Testis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649655833

Because the survival of a honeybee colony depends on the exploitation of food sources, forager bees learn and memorize variable flower sites as well as their profitability. Forager bees can be easily trained in natural settings where they forage at a feeding site and learn the related signals such as odor or color. Appetitive associative learning can also be studied under controlled conditions in the laboratory by conditioning the proboscis extension response (PER) of individually harnessed honeybees. This learning paradigm enables the study of the neuronal and molecular mechanisms that underlie learning and memory formation in a simple and highly reliable way. A behavioral pharmacology approach is used to study molecular mechanisms. Drugs are injected systemically to interfere with the function of specific molecules during or after learning and memory formation.

Creating patches with high plant diversity within farmland is commonly suggested as a measure to benefit pollinators. However, farmers rarely adopt such practice, instead removing naturally occurring plants (weeds). By combining pollinator exclusion experiments with analysis of honeybee behaviour and flower-visitation webs, we found that the presence of weeds allowed pollinators to persist within sunflower fields, maximizing the benefits of the remaining patches of natural habitat to productivity of this large-scale crop. Weed diversity increased flower visitor diversity, hence ameliorating the measured negative effects of isolation from natural habitat. Although honeybees were the most abundant visitors, diversity of flower visitors enhanced honeybee movement, being the main factor influencing productivity. Conservation of natural patches combined with promoting flowering plants within crops can maximize productivity and, therefore, reduce the need for cropland expansion, contributing towards sustainable agriculture. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Apis mellifera L.; Crop pollination limitation; Ecosystem services resilience; Flower-visitation networks; Food security; Food web; Trade-offs",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931748937

It is therefore of considerable interest why some groups have secondarily evolved low within-colony relatedness, which in turn affects the relatedness incentives of within-colony cooperation and conflict. The highest queen mating frequencies, and therefore among the lowest degrees of colony relatedness, occur in Apis honeybees and army ants of the subfamilies Aenictinae, Ecitoninae, and Dorylinae, suggesting that common life history features such as reproduction by colony fission and male biased numerical sex-ratios have convergently shaped these mating systems. Here we show that ponerine army ants of the genus Simopelta, which are distantly related but similar in general biology to other army ants, have strictly monandrous queens. Preliminary data suggest that workers reproduce in queenright colonies, which is in sharp contrast to other army ants.

The main plant families used as floral resource by A. mellifera are Amaranthaceae, Arecaceae, Asteraceae, Urticaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Lamiaceae, Fabaceae-Mimosoideae, Flacourtiaceae, Myrtaceae, Poa-ceae and Rubiaceae. In the honey samples, the pollen types of Mimosa pudica, Borreria and members of the Arecaceae family were most important during the rainy season. At harvest time (transition between rainy and dry season), Hyptis, Borreria, and an undetermined pollen type of the Asteraceae family were most important. The pollen types that show major constancy in the sample pollen were Euterpe oleracea, Asteraceae type 1, Mimosa pudica and Borreria.","Amazonia maranhense; Flora; Floristic inventory; Honey; Pollen",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960235809

Halictidae (sweat bees) and Tachinidae (Diptera) were also potentially effective pollinators. For S. lateriflorum, effective pollinators included D. arenaria, Vespula maculifrons (Vespidae), Lasioglossum spp. (Halictidae), and A. mellifera, with large syrphid flies also having moderate importance. The Halictidae was the only group of visitors that demonstrated a significant difference in the amount of time spent foraging the floral heads of these two aster species.

A functional protein seems to be produced only in individuals with a female XX karyotype where it is required to maintain the productive mode of expression through a positive feedback loop and to direct female development by instructing the downstream target genes accordingly. When zygotic activation of this loop is prevented, male development follows. Recently, traep orthologues were isolated in more distantly related dipteran species including Musca domestica, Glossina morsitans and Lucilia cuprina and in the Hymenopterans Apis mellifera and Nasonia vitripennis. All of these traep orthologues seem to act as binary switches that govern all aspects of sexual development. Transient silencing leads to complete masculinization of individuals with a female karyotype. Reciprocally, in some systems it has been shown that transient expression of the functional TRA product is sufficient to transactivate the endogenous gene and implement female development in individuals with a male karyotype. Hence, a mechanism based on traep epigenetic autoregulation seems to represent a common and presumably ancestral single principle of sex determination in Insecta. The results of these studies will not only be important for understanding divergent evolution of basic developmental processes but also for designing new strategies to improve genetic sexing in different insect species of economical or medical importance. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Autoregulation; Ceratitis capitata; Epigenetic; Sex determination; Sexing; Transformer",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251632346

Both domains are connected with a linker peptide. The knowledge about the structure and function of Api SI and Api SII is limited mainly to their amino acid sequences. We constructed 3-D models of the two proteases using their amino acid sequences and crystallographic coordinates of related proteins.

However, few studies have examined how much of the variance in tropical tree fecundity is explained by individual attributes of trees (e.g. number of flowers), and how much is due to contextual variables such as distances to nearest flowering neighbours. Using multiple regressions we examined the relative contributions of these factors to the pollination and fecundity of Goetzea elegans, a mainly self-incompatible tree endemic to Puerto Rico. We studied the largest wild population of the species during the peak flowering and collected data on the frequency of pollinator visits (N = 25 trees), and the fecundity of the whole population (N = 105), including the visitation rate of two pollinators (the honey bee Apis mellifera and the bananaquit Coereba flaveola), the total number of flowers produced by each tree, and the total fruit set and seed viability per tree. We also recorded the distance to flowering conspecifics and heterospecifics, and the height for each tree. Flower number had a strong positive effect on pollinator visitation, but distance to nearest neighbours was equally or more important than flower number in influencing fecundity. Also, competition for limited pollinators between G. elegans and other species has a stronger effect than the facilitation that conspecifics may provide. Our results suggest that pollinator visits and aspects of fecundity of G. elegans depend both on the attributes of individual plants, and on those of the community of other nearby plants. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.","Apis mellifera; Caribbean; Coereba flaveola; fruit set; nearest neighbour distance; partial self-incompatibility; pollination; Puerto Rico; seed viability; tropical trees",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865736462

To date, yellow-like genes have only been identified in insect species and a number of bacteria. The function of the yellows is largely unknown, although a few have been associated with melanization and behavior in Drosophila, and a unique clade of genes from Apis mellifera may be involved in caste specification. Here, we show that yellow-like sequences are present in bacteria, insects, and fungi but absent from other eukaryotes apart from isolated putative sequences in Amphioxus, the Salmon Louse, and Naegleria. The yellow-like family forms a discrete gene class characterized by the presence of a major royal jelly protein domain, but eukaryote yellow-like proteins are not monophyletic. The unusual phylogenetic distribution of yellow-like sequences suggests either multiple horizontal transfer from bacteria into eukaryotes or extensive gene loss in eukaryote lineages. Comparative analysis of yellow family synteny and gene order demonstrates that a highly conserved block of three to five genes has been maintained throughout insect diversification despite extensive genome rearrangements. We show strong purifying selection on seven yellow genes over approximately 100 My separating the silkmoth and Heliconius butterflies and an association between spatial regulation of gene expression and distribution of melanic pigment in the developing butterfly wing. A single ancestral yellow-like gene has therefore undergone multiple rounds of duplication within the insects accompanied by functional constraint on both genomic location and protein evolution. © 2010 The Author.","duplication; gene transfer; melanin; yellow",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650451924

The toxicity of aflatoxin B1 (AB1) and ochratoxin A (OTA), products of Aspergillus species often found in honeybee hives, was evaluated and LC 50 values for both toxins were calculated. Workers can tolerate a wide range of concentrations of both OTA and AB1. At low concentrations, AB1 (1 μg/g and 2.5 μg/g diet) and OTA (1 μg/g) did not have any apparent toxic effects on bees. Enhancement of the toxicity of AB1 by piperonyl butoxide (PBO), a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, indicates a role for P450s in AB1 detoxification in honeybees. Extracts of propolis, a complex mixture of plant-derived chemicals, including many flavonoids and other phenolic compounds, similarly ameliorated aflatoxin toxicity and delayed the onset of mortality.

While many studies focus on the direct impact of alien plants on native systems, indirect effects of plant invaders on co-flowering natives, for example through competition for pollination services, are less well studied and the results are variable. We used six temporally and taxonomically highly resolved plant-pollinator networks from the island of Mahé, Seychelles, to investigate the indirect impact of invasive alien plant species on remnant native plant communities mediated by shared pollinators. We employed fully quantitative network parameters and information on plant reproductive success, and pollinator diversity and behaviour, to detect changes in plant-pollinator networks along an invasion gradient. The number of visits to and fruit set of native plants did not change with invasion intensity. Weighted plant linkage and interaction evenness, however, was lower at invaded sites than at less invaded sites. These patterns were primarily driven by shifts in interactions of the most common pollinator, the introduced honey bee Apis mellifera, while weak interactions and strong native interactions remained unchanged. Synthesis. The implications of these findings are twofold: first, quantitative network parameters are important tools for detecting underlying biological patterns. Secondly, alien plants and pollinators may play a greater role in shaping network structure at high than low levels of invasion. We could not show, however, whether the presence of invasive plants result in a simplification of plant-pollinator networks that is detrimental to native plants and pollinators alike. © 2010 The Authors.

(Hymenoptera: Apidae), whose breeding incorporated the trait of Varroa sensitive hygiene (VSH). VSH confers resistance to the parasitic mite Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman by enhancing the ability of the bees to hygienically remove mite-infested brood. VSH production queens (i.e., queens commercially available for use in beekeepers' production colonies) from the six sources were established in colonies which later were measured for VSH. Their responses were compared with those of colonies with three other types of queens, as follows: VSH queens from the selected closed population maintained by USDA-ARS for research and as a source of breeding germplasm, queens from the cooperating commercial distributor of this germplasm, and queens of a commercial, mite-susceptible source. The reduction of mite infestation in brood combs exposed to test colonies for 1 wk differed significantly between groups. On average, colonies with VSH production queens reduced infestation by 44%. This group average was intermediate between the greater removal by pure ARS VSH (76%) and the cooperators' breeding colonies (64%), and the lesser removal by susceptible colonies (7%). VSH production colonies from the different sources had variable expression of hygiene against mites, with average reduced infestations ranging from 22 to 74%. In addition, infertility was high among mites that remained in infested cells in VSH breeder colonies from ARS and the commercial distributor but was lower and more variable in VSH production colonies and susceptible colonies. Commercial VSH production colonies supply mite resistance that generally seems to be useful for beekeeping. Resistance probably could be improved if more VSH drones sources were supplied when VSH production queens are being mated. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.","Apis mellifera; breeding; mite resistance; Varroa destructor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960360270

Most studies of GSTs in insects have been focused on their role in detoxifying exogenous compounds in particular insecticides. Here, we show the expression profiles of GSTs of the bumblebee Bombus ignitus in response to oxidative stress. We identified a sigma-class GST from B. ignitus (BiGSTS). The BiGSTS gene consists of 4 exons that encode 201 amino acids. Comparative analysis indicates that the predicted amino acid sequence of BiGSTS shares a high identity with the sigma-class GSTs of hymenopteran insects such as Apis mellifera (70% protein sequence identity) and Solenopsis invicta (59% protein sequence identity). Tissue distribution analyses showed the presence of BiGSTS in all tissues examined, including the fat body, midgut, muscle and epidermis. The oxidative stress responses analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR showed that under H2O2 overload, BiGSTS and BiGSTD (identified in our previous study) were upregulated in all tissues examined, including the fat body and midgut of B. ignitus worker bees. Under uniform conditions of H2O2 overload, the expression profile of GSTs and other antioxidant enzyme genes, such as phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (Bi-PHGPx) and peroxiredoxins (BiPrx1 and BiTPx1), showed that other antioxidant enzyme genes are acutely induced at 3h after H2O2 exposure, whereas BiGSTS and BiGSTD are highly induced at 9h after H2O2 exposure in the fat body of B. ignitus worker bees. These findings indicate that GSTs and other antioxidant enzyme genes in B. ignitus are differentially expressed in response to oxidative stress. Taken together, our findings indicate that BiGSTS and BiGSTD are oxidative stress-inducible antioxidant enzymes that may play a role in oxidative stress response. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Antioxidant enzyme; Bombus ignitus; Bumblebee; Glutathione S-transferase; Insect; Oxidative stress; Reactive oxygen species",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649629672

A genetically diverse colony benefits from an enhanced foraging effort, fuelled in part by an increase in the number of recruitment signals that are produced by foragers. However, the influence of patriline diversity on the attention paid to these signals by audiences of potentially receptive workers remains unexplored. To determine whether recruitment dances performed by foragers in multiple-patriline colonies attract a greater number of dance followers than dances in colonies that lack patriline diversity, we trained workers from multiple- and single-patriline colonies to forage in a greenhouse and monitored their dance-following activity back in the hives. On average, more workers followed a dance if it was performed in a multiple-patriline colony rather than a single-patriline colony (33% increase), and for a greater number of dance circuits per follower. Furthermore, dance-following workers in multiple-patriline colonies were more likely to exit their hive after following a dance, although this did not translate to a difference in colony-level exit rates between treatment types. Recruiting nest mates to profitable food sources through dance communication is critical to a colony's foraging success and long-term fitness; polyandrous queens produce colonies that benefit not only from increased recruitment signalling, but also from the generation of larger and more attentive audiences of signal receivers. This study highlights the importance of integrating responses of both signal senders and receivers to understand more fully the success of animal-communication systems. © 2010 The Author(s).","Animal communication; Apis mellifera; Genetic diversity; Recruitment signalling; Waggle-dance language",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251594869

The position of the sun is seasonal between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn so that turns at the end of waggle runs will vary with season and latitude. The bees are confronted with a new difficulty when the sun closely approaches its zenith because only slight errors in the bees' estimation of the relative positions of the sun and zenith generate very large errors. So, the sun compass loses its usefulness when at its zenith. We review experiments and observations on both foraging and absconding in relation to the azimuth.

Its purpose is to solve the Multi-objective Optimal Operation Management (MOOM) problem which can be affected by Fuel cell power plants (FCPPs). Minimizing total electrical energy losses, total electrical energy cost, total pollutant emission produced by sources and deviation of bus voltages are the objective functions in this method. A new interactive fuzzy satisfying method is presented to solve the multi-objective problem by assuming that the decision-maker (DM) has fuzzy targets for each of the objective functions. Through the interaction with the DM, the fuzzy goals are quantified by eliciting the corresponding membership functions. Considering the current solution, the DM updates the reference membership values until the best solution can be obtain. The MOOM problem is modeled as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. Therefore, evolutionary methods can be used to solve this problem since they are independence of objective function's type and constraints. Recently researchers have presented a new evolutionary method called Honey Bee Mating Optimizations (HBMO) algorithm. Original HBMO often converges to local optima and this is a disadvantage of this method. In order to avoid this shortcoming we propose a new method. This method improves the mating process and also combines the modified HBMO with a Chaotic Local Search (CLS). Numerical results on a distribution test system have been presented to illustrate the performance and applicability of the proposed method. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Fuel Cell Power Plant (FCPP); Hybrid Modified Honey Bee Mating Optimization (HMHBMO); Interactive fuzzy satisfying method; Multi-objective Optimal Operation Management (MOOM); Multi-objective optimization",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650728229

Small populations are at risk because individuals are more likely to be affected by stochastic processes and inbreeding depression (Allee effect). Additionally, several studies have found that plants in small populations also experience lower pollinator visitation rates, which may further decrease reproduction. In this study, seed set, pollinator visitation and pollen limitation of Thymus capitatus (L.) was assessed in 32 patches in eight populations of various sizes on the island of Lesvos, Greece. All populations except one were significantly pollen-limited. We found that although free-pollinated flowers produced more seeds in larger populations this was not due to higher pollinator visitation rates as flowers which received pollen supplements also produced more seeds in larger populations. We hypothesize that the higher seed set is due to a generally greater genetic variability or better habitat quality. We show that honeybee visitation alone significantly decreases pollen limitation. © INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences, 2010.","Lesvos; Patch size; Pollen limitation; Pollination; Population size; Thymus capitatus",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054710516

The agricultural use of systemic insecticides, such as neonicotinoids, may harm bees through their presence in pollen and nectar, which bees consume. Many studies have tested the effects on honey bees of imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid, but a clear picture of the risk it poses to bees has not previously emerged, because investigations are methodologically varied and inconsistent in outcome. In a meta-analysis of fourteen published studies of the effects of imidacloprid on honey bees under laboratory and semi-field conditions that comprised measurements on 7073 adult individuals and 36 colonies, fitted dose-response relationships estimate that trace dietary imidacloprid at field-realistic levels in nectar will have no lethal effects, but will reduce expected performance in honey bees by between 6 and 20%. Statistical power analysis showed that published field trials that have reported no effects on honey bees from neonicotinoids were incapable of detecting these predicted sublethal effects with conventionally accepted levels of certainty.

The aim of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was to evaluate whether homeopathy is able to influence long-term outcome in critically ill patients suffering from severe sepsis. Methods: Seventy patients with severe sepsis received homeopathic treatment (n=35) or placebo (n=35). Five globules in a potency of 200c were given at 12. h interval during the stay at the intensive care unit. Survival after a 30 and 180 days was recorded. Results: Three patients (2 homeopathy, 1 placebo) were excluded from the analyses because of incomplete data. All these patients survived. Baseline characteristics including age, sex, BMI, prior conditions, APACHE II score, signs of sepsis, number of organ failures, need for mechanical ventilation, need for vasopressors or veno-venous hemofiltration, and laboratory parameters were not significantly different between groups. On day 30, there was non-statistically significantly trend of survival in favour of homeopathy (verum 81.8%, placebo 67.7%, P=0.19). On day 180, survival was statistically significantly higher with verum homeopathy (75.8% vs 50.0%, P=0.043). No adverse effects were observed. Conclusions: Our data suggest that homeopathic treatment may be an useful additional therapeutic measure with a long-term benefit for severely septic patients admitted to the intensive care unit. A constraint to wider application of this method is the limited number of trained homeopaths. © 2011 The Faculty of Homeopathy.","APACHE II; Critically ill patients; Double-blind; Homeopathy; Intensive care unit; Placebo-controlled study; Randomized prospective; Sepsis; Survival",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953197639

Like honeybees they live in large eusocial colonies and rely on complex chemical recognition and communication systems. In contrast to honeybees, their ecology and especially their chemical ecology have received only little attention, particularly in the Old World. We previously have analyzed the chemical profiles of six paleotropical stingless bee species from Borneo and revealed the presence of species-specific cuticular terpenes- an environmentally derived compound class so far unique among social insects. Here, we compared the bees' surface profiles to the chemistry of their nest material. Terpenes, alkanes, and alkenes were the dominant compound groups on both body surfaces and nest material. However, bee profiles and nests strongly differed in their chemical composition. Body surfaces thus did not merely mirror nests, rendering a passive compound transfer from nests to bees unlikely. The difference between nests and bees was particularly pronounced when all resin-derived compounds (terpenes) were excluded and only genetically determined compounds were considered. When terpenes were included, bee profiles and nest material still differed, because whole groups of terpenes (e. g., sesquiterpenes) were found in nest material of some species, but missing in their chemical profile, indicating that bees are able to influence the terpene composition both in their nests and on their surfaces. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Cuticular profile; Meliponines; Resin; Stingless bees; Terpenes; Wax chemistry",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251637496

This appears to be the case in young queens of the ant Cardiocondyla ""latifrons"", a species that builds its nests in rather stable rock crevices. Young queens in small colonies without a mature queen fought violently for inheritance of the nest site and its workers. Queen aggression and subsequent attacks by workers killed about 50% of the young queens in our experimental nests. Queen killing differs qualitatively from previously reported dominance interactions among prospective female reproductives in other ants, which are mostly ritualized and allow losers to pursue alternative ways of increasing their direct or indirect fitness. Our observations add a novel case of siblicide to the previously reported lethal aggression among nestling birds, parasitoid larvae, and honey bee queens.

We combined a model for trait evolution with data for twenty plant-animal assemblages to explore coevolution in mutualistic networks. The results revealed three fundamental aspects of coevolution in species-rich mutualisms. First, coevolution shapes species traits throughout mutualistic networks by speeding up the overall rate of evolution. Second, coevolution results in higher trait complementarity in interacting partners and trait convergence in species in the same trophic level. Third, convergence is higher in the presence of super-generalists, which are species that interact with multiple groups of species. We predict that worldwide shifts in the occurrence of super-generalists will alter how coevolution shapes webs of interacting species. Introduced species such as honeybees will favour trait convergence in invaded communities, whereas the loss of large frugivores will lead to increased trait dissimilarity in tropical ecosystems. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Coevolution; Complementarity; Convergence; Ecological networks; Evolutionary cascades; Generalists; Mutualisms; Pollination; Seed dispersal; Small-world networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931749097

Workers in many field colonies from the Caribbean Islands have identical multilocus genotypes and are thus probably clonal, but the occurrence of males makes an ameiotic mechanism of thelytoky unlikely.

Additionally, we screened a large number of field colonies from thelytokous populations for the occurrence of recombination events.

Optimal placement of renewable electricity generators (REGs) results in reduction of objective functions like losses, costs of electrical generation and voltage deviation. Because of recent technology developments of photovoltaic units, wind turbine and fuel cell units, only these generators are considered in this paper. This work presents a multiobjective optimization algorithm for the siting and sizing of renewable electricity generators. The objectives consist of minimization of costs, emission and losses of distributed system and optimization of voltage profile. This multiobjective optimization is solved by the Improved honey bee mating optimization (HBMO) algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, an external repository is considered to save non-dominated (Pareto) solutions found during the search process. Since the objective functions are not the same, a fuzzy clustering technique is used to control the size of the repository within the limits. This algorithm is executed on a typical 70-bus test system. Results of the case study show the proper siting and sizing of REGs are important to improve the voltage profile, reduce costs, emission and losses of distribution system. The main feature of the algorithm refers to its accuracy and calculation speed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Backward-forward load flow; Honey bee mating optimization (HBMO); Multiobjective; Renewable electricity generator (REG) placement",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052267959

Electric load sometimes demonstrates a seasonal (cyclic) tendency due to economic activities or climate cyclic nature. The applications of SVR models to deal with seasonal (cyclic) electric load forecasting have not been widely explored. In addition, the concept of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), focused on using past information to capture detailed information, is helpful to be combined into an SVR model. This investigation presents an electric load forecasting model which combines the seasonal recurrent support vector regression model with chaotic artificial bee colony algorithm (namely SRSVRCABC) to improve the forecasting performance. The proposed SRSVRCABC employs the chaotic behavior of honey bees which is with better performance in function optimization to overcome premature local optimum. A numerical example from an existed reference is used to elucidate the forecasting performance of the proposed SRSVRCABC model. The forecasting results indicate that the proposed model yields more accurate forecasting results than ARIMA and TF-ε-SVR-SA models. Therefore, the SRSVRCABC model is a promising alternative for electric load forecasting. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Chaotic artificial bee colony (CABC) algorithm; Electric load forecasting; Recurrent SVR (RSVR); Seasonal adjustment; Support vector regression (SVR)",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052103053

The connection of enormous DGs into existing distribution network changes the operation of distribution systems. Because of the small X/.

This paper presents a new algorithm for multiobjective daily Volt/Var control in distribution systems including Distributed Generators (DGs). The objectives are costs of energy generation by DGs and distribution companies, electrical energy losses and the voltage deviations for the next day. A new optimization algorithm based on a Chaotic Improved Honey Bee Mating Optimization (CIHBMO) is proposed to determine the active power values of DGs, reactive power values of capacitors and tap positions of transformers for the next day.

Although there has been a great deal of investigation into how individual foragers allocate time between exploration and exploitation, few studies have sought to explore this issue within a larger functional context. We take a comparative approach to this problem by examining decision making in individual honeybees and bumblebees as they responded to a downshift in food reward. Our results show not only that honeybees and bumblebees have significantly divergent strategies with regards to abandoning a food source that is declining in value but also in terms of the subsequent tendency to seek an alternative food source. We interpret these results in terms of both biological and social distinctions between these species and highlight how group-level characteristics are likely to shape the evolutionarily derived foraging strategies of individual animals. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Bumblebees; Exploration versus exploitation; Foraging behavior; Honeybees; Social foraging",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651520970

(Hymenoptera: Apidae, Apinae, Bombini) has been introduced to Japan and became the dominant bumblebee in some areas, replacing native species. To implement an effective eradication program, the attributes responsible for establishment of the species must be better understood. Because body size has frequently been related to reproductive success in female insects, I examined the effect of B. terrestris queen size during hibernation, nest founding, and reproduction stages. Queens exhibited clear variation in size. Foundresses were significantly larger than gynes, indicating that larger queens may have an advantage over smaller ones in surviving hibernation. The over-representation of queens with pollen at larger sizes suggested that larger queens may also have an advantage over smaller ones in nest founding. On the other hand, foundress size was not significantly associated with reproductive output. The number of collected foundresses in this study was not sufficient to draw a clear conclusion but factors other than foundress size may also play an important role in determining reproduction. In addition, gyne size increased significantly during the 4-year survey. Because large queens have an advantage during hibernation, increased body size may increase the number of hibernating queens that survive, allowing them to outcompete native bumblebees. © 2010 The Author.

This ""flower constancy"" probably benefits plants, because pollen is more likely to be deposited on conspecific stigmas. But it is less clear why insects should ignore rewarding alternative flowers. Many researchers have argued that flower constancy is caused by constraints imposed by insect nervous systems rather than because flower constancy is itself an efficient foraging method. We argue that this view is unsatisfactory because it both fails to explain why foragers flexibly adjust the degree of flower constancy and does not explain why foragers of closely related species show different degrees of constancy. While limitations of the nervous system exist and are likely to influence flower constancy to some degree, the observed behavioral flexibility suggests that flower constancy is a successful foraging strategy given the insect's own information about different foraging options.","Flower constancy; Foraging; Honeybee; Learning; Pollination",Short Survey,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858659648

Propolis is a resinous substance collected by honeybees from leaf buds and exudates from various plant sources, which is employed for construction and repair of the honeycomb. More than 180 compounds have been reported as being constituents of propolis: polyphenols (flavonoids, phenolic acids and their esters), terpenoids, steroids, and amino acids. Nevertheless, its composition varies qualitatively and quantitatively with the geographical and botanical origins. Propolis possesses antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, antiulcer, hepatoprotective, antitumor, immunostimulating and antioxidant activities, among others. These activities are particularly dependent on the chemical composition of propolis. In the present work the antioxidant activities, measured by several methods, in hydro-alcoholic extracts of propolis collected at different zones of Algarve, during winter and spring, were evaluated. Phenolic content was evaluated along with the capacity of extracts of propolis for scavenging DPPH and ABTS free radicals as well as superoxide anion. The zones were spread by 3 areas in central Algarve: Serra do Algarve (Califórnia, Cabaça, Sarnadinha, Sobreira and Vila Chã Vermelhos); Barrocal (Ameijoafra, Arrodeios and Pé da Serra), and the third region was an intermediate zone between those two regions, that we called as Transition (Rio Seco, Bicão Alto, Jordana, Lavajo and Madeira). Independent on the collection time generally Ameijoafra, Arrodeios and Pé da Serra, all of them belonging to the Barrocal region, presented the highest amount of phenols. Concerning the antioxidant activity, namely the capacity for scavenging DPPH radicals, the extracts obtained from Ameijoafra, Pé da Serra and Arrodeios (Maqui) in both collection times, and Vila Chã Vermelhos (Mountain), only in spring, was the most active. A practically similar pattern was observed when the activity was measured through the ABTS radical scavenging. These results were coincident with the highest amounts of phenols present in the extracts. Only the samples from Barrocal were significant better inhibitors of superoxide anion radicals' formation than the remaining samples.","Algarve; Free radical scavenging; Propolis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960428969

Many investigators now recognize that extrapolations of these models with geographic information systems (GIS) might be sensitive to the environmental bounds of the data used in their development, yet there is no recommended best practice for ""clamping"" model extrapolations. We relied on two commonly used modeling approaches: classification and regression tree (CART) and maximum entropy (Maxent) models, and we tested a simple alteration of the model extrapolations, bounding extrapolations to the maximum and minimum values of primary environmental predictors, to provide a more realistic map of suitable habitat of hybridized Africanized honey bees in the southwestern United States.

(Iridaceae: Iridoideae), a genus of cormous geophytes, we recognize 18 species, eight more than were included in the 1979 account of the genus by M.P. de Vos. One of these, F. ovata, based on Moraea ovala Thunb. (1800), was only discovered to be a species of Ferraria in 2001, and three more are the result of our different view of De Vos's taxonomy. In tropical Africa, F. glutinosa is recircumscribed to include only mid- to late summer-flowering plants, usually with a single basal leaf and with purple to brown flowers often marked with yellow. A second summer-flowering species, F. candelabrum, includes taller plants with several basal leaves. Spring and early summer-flowering plants lacking foliage leaves and with yellow flowers from central Africa are referred to F. spithamea or F. welwilschii respectively. The remaining species are restricted to western southern Africa, an area of winter rainfall and summer drought. We recognize three new species: F. flava and F. ornata from the sandveld of coastal Namaqualand, and F. parva, which has among the smallest flowers in the genus and is restricted to the Western Cape coastal plain between Ganzekraal and Langrietvlei near Hopefield. Ferraria ornata blooms in May and June in response to the first rains of the season. Among the remaining species, F. uncinata subsp. macrochlamys is now F. macrochlamys and is treated as comprising three subspecies: subsp. macrochlamys from central and northern Namaqualand has leaves with thickened, crisped margins; subsp. kamiesbergensis from the southern Kamiesberg has leaves with unthickened margins and blades curved in one direction; and subsp. serpentina from gravels and sands of coastal Namaqualand has serpentine leaves, also with unthickened margins. Among the remaining species, F. divaricata subsp. arenosa is now treated as a synonym of F divaricata. Because of our re-interpretation of the type of F. divaricata, plants which were called F. divaricata subsp. divaricata and subsp. australis are now treated as synonyms under the name F. variabilis. Flowers of Ferraria are unique in Iridaceae in having tepal limbs with crisped margins and a style that divides into flattened branches, each deeply forked with finely fringed adaxial margins. Despite relative floral uniformity, the genus displays a surprising range of discrete pollination systems for so small a genus. Pollinators include Diptera in the families Muscidae, Calliphoridae, and Sarcophagidae (F. crispa group); anthophorine and honey bees (F. ferrariola); eumenid wasps (F divaricata, F. macrochamys, F. variabilis); and Coleoptera in the families Meloidae and Melyridae (F. uncinata). Preliminary phylogenetic analysis using plastid DNA regions shows F. glutinosa to be sister to an unresolved cluster of southern African species and confirms as plesiomorphic the open branching habit, many-flowered inflorescences and exserted globose capsules that characterize F glutinosa and its immediate allies in subgen.

Specifically, egg production and sexual harassment of females by males reduce female longevity. This may apply to some short-lived species such as Drosophila, but not to some long-lived species such as the queens of ants and bees. Bee queens lay up to 2000 eggs a day for several years, but they nevertheless live at least 20 times longer than their sisters, the sterile workers. This discrepancy necessitates a critical reevaluation of the validity of both the trade-off concept as such, and of the current theories of aging. The widely accepted oxidative stress theory of aging with its links to metabolism and the insulin/IGF-I system has been disproven in Caenorhabditis elegans and mice, but not in Drosophila, necessitating other approaches. The recent spermidine/mitophagy theory is gaining momentum. Two major mechanisms may have been largely overlooked, namely epigenetic control of longevity by imprinting through DNA methylation as suggested by recent data in the honey bee, and especially, a mechanism of which the principles are outlined here, the progressive weakening of the "" electrical dimension"" of cells up to the point of total collapse, namely death. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Aging theories; Dnmt2; Ecdysone; Imprinting; MiRNAs; Mitophagy",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650209222

However, the concept of static snapshot matching might not explain all aspects of homing behavior, as honeybees are able to use landmarks that are statically camouflaged. In this case the landmarks are only detectable by relative motion cues between the landmark and the background, which the bees generate when they perform characteristic flight maneuvers close to the landmarks. The bees' navigation performance can be explained by a matching scheme based on optic flow amplitudes (""dynamic snapshot matching"").

As in other stingless bees and the honey bee one type stands on, in or near the nest entrance. The second type, so far only known in t. angustula, hovers near the nest entrance. In order to gain further understanding of this unique situation we studied guarding behaviour in both types of guards. Using marked bees, we found that individual worker bees guarded for a long time, up to 20 days, relative to their short, average c. 21 day, lifespan. Relatively few, 33%, individually marked guards were seen performing both types of guarding. The others only acted as standing guards. The bees that did perform both types did so over similar periods of their life. Hovering bouts were 57 min long, interrupted by breaks inside the hive of a few minutes (3.3 ± 1.5 min). Standing bouts were slightly longer (74 min) and also interrupted by short breaks (7.82 ± 6.45 min). Human breath, mimicking a vertebrate intruder, caused the guards to retreat into the nest rather than to attack the intruder. Some colonies protected themselves against intruders by closing the entrance during the night (32% and 56% of colonies during two nights). In summary, our results indicate that nest entrance guarding in T. angustula involves division of labour between the two types, in which most guarding individuals only act as standing guards. © 2011 Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.","Division of labour; Guarding behaviour; Jataí; Meliponini",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952911320

Economic dispatch (ED) is one of the most important optimization problems in power systems. ED has the objective of dividing the power demand among the online generators economically while satisfying various constraints. The importance of economic dispatch is to get maximum usable power using minimum resources. To solve the static ED problem, honey bee mating algorithm (HBMO) can be used. The basic disadvantage of the original HBMO algorithm is the fact that it may miss the optimum and provide a near optimum solution in a limited runtime period. In order to avoid this shortcoming, we propose a new method that improves the mating process of HBMO and also, combines the improved HBMO with a Chaotic Local Search (CLS) called Chaotic Improved Honey Bee Mating Optimization (CIHBMO). The proposed algorithm is used to solve ED problems taking into account the nonlinear generator characteristics such as prohibited operation zones, multi-fuel and valve-point loading effects. The CIHBMO algorithm is tested on three test systems and compared with other methods in the literature. Results have shown that the proposed method is efficient and fast for ED problems with non-smooth and non-continuous fuel cost functions. Moreover, the optimal power dispatch obtained by the algorithm is superior to previous reported results. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Chaotic local search; Economic dispatch; Improved honey bee mating optimization; Multi-fuel effect",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551539284

This allowed us to combine the global measure of the net rate of food delivery to the hive with a detailed examination of bees' performance at flowers over time. Although bees exhibited short-term improvements in foraging ability during their first few foraging trips, we did not observe the predicted long-term increase in performance over days. Our results suggest that a variety of flower-handling tasks, flower choice and movements between plants can be learned quickly under the simple greenhouse settings.

Each species can decode the information contained in the waggle dances of the other. While workers cooperate in comb construction, A. mellifera workers behaved more defectively in thermoregulation.

Natural products, such as essential oils, might be an option to control V. destructor. Acaricidal effects of Tagetes minuta L. essential oils on V. destructor mites were studied. The essential oils were extracted by steam distillation from different parts of the plant in diverse stages of their vital cycle. Live V. destructor mites were sampled from an infested experimental apiary to which no previous acaricide treatments had been applied. Groups of ten mites were kept in Petri dishes with small oiled wooden sticks under controlled atmosphere.

After six hours, most mites exposed to any of the oils were dead. Oils toxicity for bees was also evaluated.

The data acquired during absolute and differential classical conditioning differed with respect to the number of conditioning trials, the conditioned odors, the intertrial intervals, and the time of retention tests. We further investigated data in which animals were tested for spontaneous recovery from extinction. In all data sets we found that the gradually increasing group-average learning curve did not adequately represent the behavior of individual animals. Individual behavior was characterized by a rapid and stable acquisition of the conditioned response (CR), as well as by a rapid and stable cessation of the CR following unrewarded stimuli.

Our imaging platform allows to simultaneously obtain both morphological measurements of the ALs functional units, the glomeruli, and in vivo calcium recording of their neural activity. We were able to record the characteristic glomerular response maps to odour stimuli applied to the bee's antennae. Our approach offers several advantages over the commonly used conventional fluorescence microscopy. Two-photon microscopy provides substantial enhancement in both spatial and temporal resolutions, while minimizing photo damage.

Two mesostigmatid families, Varroidae and Laelapidae, are serious honeybee pests that threaten current global apiculture. Once recognised as a single species, Varroa jacobsoni (Varroidae) was found to be a species complex of at least two species. We now know that a distinct species, V. destructor, which parasitises Apis cerana in mainland Asia, is the culprit that is also responsible for the destruction of European honeybee colonies, A. mellifera, worldwide. Likewise, the parasitic species of the family Laelapidae, Tropilaelaps clareae, was once thought to be genetically homogenous across its distribution in Asia. Population genetic studies along with reproductive isolation evidences reveal substantial variations in T. clareae, which suggest that different mites from various locations in Asia may differ in their levels of pathogenicity to both their native hosts and A. mellifera. Life histories of Varroa and Tropilaelaps are briefly addressed in the chapter. Future works on Asian honeybee mites focusing on population-level diversity may assist in the discovery of new genetic-types of mites and their corresponding levels of pathogenicity on their native host populations and on A. mellifera. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.

In humans, one of the most profound consequences of sleep deprivation is imprecise or irrational communication, demonstrated by degradation in signaling as well as in receiving information. Communication in nonhuman animals may suffer analogous degradation of precision, perhaps with especially damaging consequences for social animals. However, society-specific consequences of sleep loss have rarely been explored, and no function of sleep has been ascribed to a truly social (eusocial) organism in the context of its society. Here we show that sleep-deprived honey bees (Apis mellifera) exhibit reduced precision when signaling direction information to food sources in their waggle dances. The deterioration of the honey bee's ability to communicate is expected to reduce the foraging efficiency of nestmates. This study demonstrates the impact of sleep deprivation on signaling in a eusocial animal. If the deterioration of signals made by sleep-deprived honey bees and humans is generalizable, then imprecise communication may be one detrimental effect of sleep loss shared by social organisms.","Dance language; Recovery sleep; Signal precision; Sleep rebound",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651074741

Ordinarily sterile workers can usually reproduce given the right conditions, so the factors regulating reproductive division of labour may provide insight into why eusociality has persisted over evolutionary time. Queen-produced pheromones that affect worker reproduction have been implicated in diverse taxa, including ants, termites, wasps and possibly mole rats, but to date have only been definitively identified in the honeybee. Using the black garden ant Lasius niger, we isolate the first sterility-regulating ant queen pheromone. The pheromone is a cuticular hydrocarbon that comprises the majority of the chemical profile of queens and their eggs, and also affects worker behaviour, by reducing aggression towards objects bearing the pheromone. We further show that the pheromone elicits a strong response in worker antennae and that its production by queens is selectively reduced following an immune challenge. These results suggest that the pheromone has a central role in colony organization and support the hypothesis that worker sterility represents altruistic self-restraint in response to an honest quality signal. © 2010 The Royal Society.","Cuticular hydrocarbon; Handicap; Lasius niger; Queen signal; Social insect",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650072664

Conditioned food aversions have been studied in animals as diverse as nematodes and humans [1, 2], but the neural signaling mechanisms underlying this form of learning have been difficult to pinpoint. Honeybees quickly learn to associate floral cues with food [3], a trait that makes them an excellent model organism for studying the neural mechanisms of learning and memory. Here we show that honeybees not only detect toxins but can also learn to associate odors with both the taste of toxins and the postingestive consequences of consuming them. We found that two distinct monoaminergic pathways mediate learned food aversions in the honeybee. As for other insect species conditioned with salt or electric shock reinforcers [4-7], learned avoidances of odors paired with bad-tasting toxins are mediated by dopamine. Our experiments are the first to identify a second, postingestive pathway for learned olfactory aversions that involves serotonin. This second pathway may represent an ancient mechanism for food aversion learning conserved across animal lineages. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigated the effect of a protein synthesis inhibitor (emetine) on the memory formed after reversal learning in the honeybee Apis mellifera. Two groups of bees were studied: summer bees and winter bees, each yielded different results. Blocking protein synthesis in summer bees inhibits consolidation of the excitatory learning following reversal learning whereas it blocked the consolidation of the inhibitory learning in winter bees.

Insecticidal Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton is planted on millions of hectares annually and is a potential source of transgene flow. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we monitored 15 non-Bt cotton (Gossypium hirsutum, L.) seed production fields (some transgenic for herbicide resistance, some not) for gene flow of the Bt cotton cry1Ac transgene. We investigated seedmediated gene flow, which yields adventitious Bt cotton plants, and pollen-mediated gene flow, which generates outcrossed seeds. A spatially-explicit statistical analysis was used to quantify the effects of nearby Bt and non-Bt cotton fields at various spatial scales, along with the effects of pollinator abundance and adventitious Bt plants in fields, on pollenmediated gene flow. Adventitious Bt cotton plants, resulting from seed bags and planting error, comprised over 15% of plants sampled from the edges of three seed production fields. In contrast, pollen-mediated gene flow affected less than 1% of the seed sampled from field edges. Variation in outcrossing was better explained by the area of Bt cotton fields within 750 m of the seed production fields than by the area of Bt cotton within larger or smaller spatial scales. Variation in outcrossing was also positively associated with the abundance of honey bees. Conclusions/Significance: A comparison of statistical methods showed that our spatially-explicit analysis was more powerful for understanding the effects of surrounding fields than customary models based on distance. Given the low rates of pollen-mediated gene flow observed in this study, we conclude that careful planting and screening of seeds could be more important than field spacing for limiting gene flow. © 2010 Heuberger et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649761457

The study verified whether the investments with colony supplementation give financial returns to beekeepers, increasing profits for the diversification of bee products. In order to evaluate the five supplements, two experimental assays were performed. In each, 20 colonies were distributed randomly in four treatments, with 15 replications per colony. In assay I, the treatments were: linseed oil plus palm oil supplement, linseed oil, palm oil, and control without supplementation. In assay II, isolated soy protein plus brewer's yeast, isolated soy protein, brewer's yeast, and control without supplementation were evaluated. The following production financial indicators were determined: net operating income, total cost, profit and benefit-cost ratio. Supplements made with mixtures of linseed oil plus palm oil and isolated soy protein plus beer yeast showed ratios between the obtained profit and the calculated values for indirect production costs of 2.58 and 2.50, respectively, differing from the control (p < 0.05), which indicates it is economically viable to supplement Africanized honey bees in royal jelly production when compared to other treatments and control without supplementation.","Apis mellifera; Production cost; Profitability; Supplementation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649618468

Honey finds a vital role in various applications using its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial and antitumor properties. We investigated the potential of honey to induce cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects in cultured human prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) in comparison to non-malignant (L929) cells. Both cells were cultured in RPMI medium and treated with the selected crude honey sample at various concentrations (5, 10 and 15%) for three consecutive days. The results revealed that the cell viability decreased in a concentration and time- dependent manner in the malignant cells treated with honey in comparison with non-malignant cells. Honey showed anti- proliferative activity with the IC 50 value 4, 10 and 14% after 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively in PC-3 cell line. Overall, it can be concluded that higher concentrations of honey is safe for L929, but it exerts antitumor cytotoxicity and antiproliferative effects in a prostate cancer-derived cell line.

A strain of bees (high royal jelly producing bee, RJb) has been selected for its high RJ production, but the mechanisms of its higher yield are not understood. In this study, we compared HG acini size, RJ production, and protein differential expressions between the RJb and nonselected honeybee (Italian bee, ITb) using proteomics in combination with an electron microscopy, Western blot, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Generally, the HG of both bees showed age-dependent changes in acini sizes and protein expression as worker behaviors changed from brood nursing to nectar ripening, foraging, and storage activities. The electron microscopic analysis revealed that the HG acini diameter of the RJb strain was large and produced 5 times more RJ than the ITb, demonstrating a positive correlation between the yield and HG acini size. In addition, the proteomic analysis showed that RJb significantly upregulated a large group of proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism and energy production, those involved in protein biosynthesis, development, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide and fatty acid, transporter, protein folding, cytoskeleton, and antioxidation, which coincides with the fact that the HGs of the RJb strain produce more RJ than the ITb strain that is owing to selection pressure. We also observed age-dependent major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs) changing both in form and expressional intensity concurrent with task-switching. In addition to MRJPs, the RJb overexpressed proteins such as enolase and transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase, protein biosynthesis, and development proteins compared to the ITb strain to support its large HG growth and RJ secretion. Because of selection pressure, RJb pursued a different strategy of increased RJ production by involving additional proteins compared to its original counterpart ITb. To our knowledge, this morphological and proteomic comparison study on the HG of the two strains of worker honeybees associated with their age-dependent division of labor is the first of its kind. The study provided not only the quantity and quality differences in the HG from the RJb and the ITb, but also addressed the cellular and behavioral biology development question of how the RJb strain can produce RJ more efficiently than its wild type strain (ITb). © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649828792

The honey bee (Apis mellifera) is a key model for highly social species, and its complex social behaviour can be interpreted theoretically as changes in gene regulation, in which miRNAs are thought to be involved. We used the SOLiD sequencing system to identify the repertoire of miRNAs in the honey bee by sequencing a mixed small RNA library from different developmental stages. We obtained a total of 36 796 459 raw sequences; of which 5 491 100 short sequences were fragments of mRNA and other noncoding RNAs (ncRNA), and 1 759 346 reads mapped to the known miRNAs. We predicted 267 novel honey bee miRNAs representing 380 182 short reads, including eight miRNAs of other insects in 14 107 583 genome-mapped sequences. We verified 50 of them using stem-loop reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), in which 35 yielded PCR products. Cross-species analyses showed 81 novel miRNAs with homologues in other insects, suggesting that they were authentic miRNAs and have similar functions.

These glands are known as cephalic salivary or labial cephalic glands. The degree of development of these glands in newly emerged, nurse and forager workers and virgin and egg-laying queens of Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758 and Scaptotrigona postica Latreille, 1807 were evaluated by measuring the secretory alveolar units. The area of the secretory alveoli, measured in total gland preparations, was used to evaluate differences in size. In both species, gland size was found to increase progressively from newly emerged workers to foragers and from virgin to egg-laying queens. A statistical analysis revealed significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) in the area of gland alveoli of workers in different life phases in both species, and between S. postica virgin and egglaying queens, but not between A. mellifera queens. In the case of workers, this suggests cephalic salivary gland secretion has a function in forager activity and, in queens, a possible pheromonal function. © 2010 Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia.

Poir. (Mimosaceae) is a xerophilous plant which is very common in degraded areas in the Brazilian semi-arid region, including areas of beekeeping. The ingestion of leaves from M. tenuiflora by ruminants is responsible for malformations. Chemical analyses of this plant revealed that it contains several secondary compounds including three triterpenoidal saponins, designated Mimonosides A-C, four flavones, five flavanones and four chalcones. Several plant species contain secondary compounds in nectar and pollen that could be toxic to pollinators, including bees. Experimental approaches are necessary to identify plant species that produce pollen that is toxic to bees. The present study aimed to determine the toxic potential of M. tenuiflora (Willd.) Poir. (Mimosaceae) pollen to Africanized honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). Materials, Methods & Results: The plant species utilized in this study was Mimosa tenuiflora (Willd.) Poir. (Mimosaceae) and a voucher specimen was deposited (no. 9591) at the Dárdano de Andrade-Lima (MOSS) Herbarium, Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Árido (UFERSA), Mossoró, RN, Brazil. Pollen samples were collected near Mossoró city, RN, in northeastern Brazil (5°11'15""S and 37°20'39""W). Honeycombs that contained pupae of africanized honey bees (Apis mellifera) were collected from the apiary of UFERSA. Newly emerged forager bees, identified on basis of their body size and coloration, were used for the experiment. All the bees used were of the same age. Groups of twenty bees were put into wooden boxes (11 x 11 x 7 cm). The boxes were kept in an acclimatized chamber (BOD) at 32°C and 70% humidity. M. tenuiflora pollen was added to the food (5 parts of sugar mixed to one part of honey) at doses of 0 (control group; n=195), 2.5% (n=178), 5.0% (n=186) and 10.0% (n=186). The bees were observed daily until the last one died. Statistical analyses were performed using a statistical software (GraphPad Prism v.4 for Mac). Median survival times, with 95% confidence intervals, were estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Differences in the time distributions between groups were tested for statistical significance using the logrank test. The median survival times of the bees were four days for all groups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significant difference (P=0.0041) between the survival curves, but the log-rank test did not show statistical difference (P=0.2825). The survival curve of controls differed (P=0.001) from the survival curve of the group fed 2.5% M. tenuiflora, but did not differ from the other groups. Discussion: Several plant species contain secondary compounds in nectar and pollen that could be toxic to animals that consume them. Bees collect large amounts of pollen grains very efficiently, making these grains generally unavailable for pollination.

This study was set out to evaluate the pesticide residues in stored pollen from honey bee colonies and their possible impact on honey bee losses in Spain. In total, 1,021 professional apiaries were randomly selected. All pollen samples were subjected to multiresidue analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( MS ) and liquid chromatography-MS; moreover, specific methods were applied for neonicotinoids and fipronil. A palynological analysis also was carried out to confirm the type of foraging crop. Pesticide residues were detected in 42% of samples collected in spring, and only in 31% of samples collected in autumn. Fluvalinate and chlorfenvinphos were the most frequently detected pesticides in the analyzed samples. Fipronil was detected in 3.7% of all the spring samples but never in autumn samples, and neonicotinoid residues were not detected. More than 47.8% of stored pollen samples belonged to wild vegetation, and sunflower (Heliantus spp.) pollen was only detected in 10.4% of the samples. A direct relation between pesticide residues found in stored pollen samples and colony losses was not evident accordingly to the obtained results. Further studies are necessary to determine the possible role of the most frequent and abundant pesticides (such as acaricides) and the synergism among them and with other pathogens more prevalent in Spain. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.","Apis mellifera; colony losses; pesticide residues; stored pollen",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651099237

Patty blend formulations protected the fungal spores at brood nest temperatures and served as an improved delivery system of the fungus to bee hives. Field trials conducted in 2006 in Texas using freshly harvested spores indicated that patty blend formulations of 10 g of conidia per hive (applied twice) significantly reduced the numbers of mites per adult bee, mites in sealed brood cells, and residual mites at the end of the 47-day experimental period. Colony development in terms of adult bee populations and brood production also improved. Field trials conducted in 2007 in Florida using less virulent spores produced mixed results. Patty blends of 10 g of conidia per hive (applied twice) were less successful in significantly reducing the number of mites per adult bee. However, hive survivorship and colony strength were improved, and the numbers of residual mites were significantly reduced at the end of the 42-day experimental period. The overall results from 2003 to 2008 field trials indicated that it was critical to have fungal spores with good germination, pathogenicity and virulence. We determined that fungal spores (1 × 1010 viable spores per gram) with 98% germination and high pathogenicity (95% mite mortality at day 7) provided successful control of mite populations in established honey bee colonies at 10 g of conidia per hive (applied twice). Overall, microbial control of Varroa mite with M. anisopliae is feasible and could be a useful component of an integrated pest management program. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Apis mellifera; Biological control; Conidia; Metarhizium anisopliae; Patty blend formulations; Varroa destructor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149501030

We present evidence that Notch signaling components are expressed in a pattern implying a role in segmentation in honeybees, where the expression of genes involved in segmentation are modulated in a temporal way. Despite this, pharmacological investigation and RNA interference experiments indicate that Notch signaling does not regulate segmentation in honeybees, but instead regulates patterning within segments after segmentation itself has occurred.

Since fall 2006, honey bees in the U.S. have faced a serious population decline, due in part to a phenomenon called Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), which is a disease syndrome that is likely caused by several factors. Data from an initial study in which investigators compared pathogens in honey bees affected by CCD suggested a putative role for Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus, IAPV. This is a single stranded RNA virus with no DNA stage placed taxonomically within the family Dicistroviridae. Although subsequent studies have failed to find IAPV in all CCD diagnosed colonies, IAPV has been shown to cause honey bee mortality. RNA interference technology (RNAi) has been used successfully to silence endogenous insect (including honey bee) genes both by injection and feeding. Moreover, RNAi was shown to prevent bees from succumbing to infection from IAPV under laboratory conditions. In the current study IAPV specific homologous dsRNA was used in the field, under natural beekeeping conditions in order to prevent mortality and improve the overall health of bees infected with IAPV. This controlled study included a total of 160 honey bee hives in two discrete climates, seasons and geographical locations (Florida and Pennsylvania).

Labia in color-changed flowers showed a decreased reflectance of wavelengths less than 670 nm compared to control intact flower. Both reflectance irradiance spectra and ultraviolet photographs showed that only the nectar guide in white (unchanged) flowers reflected ultraviolet light, and that this reflectance decreased with labial color change.

Among honey bee pathogens, RNA viruses are emerging as a serious threat and are suspected as major contributors to CCD. Recent detection of these viral species in bumble bees suggests a possible wider environmental spread of these viruses with potential broader impact. It is therefore vital to study the ecology and epidemiology of these viruses in the hymenopteran pollinator community as a whole. We studied the viral distribution in honey bees, in their pollen loads, and in other non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators collected from flowering plants in Pennsylvania, New York, and Illinois in the United States. Viruses in the samples were detected using reverse transcriptase-PCR and confirmed by sequencing. For the first time, we report the molecular detection of picorna-like RNA viruses (deformed wing virus, sacbrood virus and black queen cell virus) in pollen pellets collected directly from forager bees. Pollen pellets from several uninfected forager bees were detected with virus, indicating that pollen itself may harbor viruses. The viruses in the pollen and honey stored in the hive were demonstrated to be infective, with the queen becoming infected and laying infected eggs after these virus- ontaminated foods were given to virus-free colonies. These viruses were detected in eleven other non-Apis hymenopteran species, ranging from many solitary bees to bumble bees and wasps. This finding further expands the viral host range and implies a possible deeper impact on the health of our ecosystem. Phylogenetic analyses support that these viruses are disseminating freely among the pollinators via the flower pollen itself. Notably, in cases where honey bee apiaries affected by CCD harbored honey bees with Israeli Acute Paralysis virus (IAPV), nearby non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators also had IAPV, while those near apiaries without IAPV did not. In containment greenhouse experiments, IAPV moved from infected honey bees to bumble bees and from infected bumble bees to honey bees within a week, demonstrating that the viruses could be transmitted from one species to another. This study adds to our present understanding of virus epidemiology and may help explain bee disease patterns and pollinator population decline in general. © 2010 Singh et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650985060

The infection ratio of bees treated with 40,000 spores/bee increased with time after inoculation.

Solar heat is a gain in the cold but may be a burden in the heat. We investigated the balancing of endothermic activity with radiative heat gain and physiological functions of water foraging Apis mellifera carnica honeybees in the whole range of ambient temperatures (Ta) and solar radiation they are likely to be exposed in their natural environment in Middle Europe.The mean thorax temperature (Tth) during foraging stays was regulated at a constantly high level (37.0-38.5°C) in a broad range of Ta (3-30°C). At warmer conditions (Ta=30-39°C) Tth increased to a maximal level of 45.3°C. The endothermic temperature excess (difference of Tbody-Ta of living and dead bees) was used to assess the endogenously generated temperature elevation as a correlate of energy turnover. Up to a Ta of ∼30°C bees used solar heat gain for a double purpose: to reduce energetic expenditure and to increase Tth by about 1-3°C to improve force production of flight muscles. At higher Ta they exhibited cooling efforts to get rid of excess heat. A high Tth also allowed regulation of the head temperature high enough to guarantee proper function of the bees' suction pump even at low Ta. This shortened the foraging stays and this way reduced energetic costs. With decreasing Ta bees also reduced arrival body weight and crop loading to do both minimize costs and optimize flight performance. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Crop load; Foraging; Honeybee; Thermoregulation; Water",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958465393

P. cincinnata showed diurnal anthesis (06h a.m.) and flower duration was approximately nine hours. Nectar production varied from 176μl to 204μl, with concentration varied from 38% to 40%. The curvature process was synchronized among styles of the same flower, with mean curvature time of two hours. Among the evaluated flowers (n=164), it was found that 47.6% showed styles without curvature, 25% showed styles partially curved and 27.4% showed styles totally curved, indicating that 72.6% of the flowers of P. cincinnata would be functionally male and not produce frutis. Among the floral visitors, there were honey bees, wasps, moths, butterflies and hummingbird. It was found that between 06 and 09 a.m. was the period most visited to flowers. Analyzing the frequency of visit, it was found that the honey bees Xylocopa were registered during the whole day in conventional cultivation, except between 10h and 11h a.m. and 02 and 03h. p.m., however concentrating their visits between 03 and 04 p.m. Trigona spinipes Fab. made visits only in the morning, between 06 and 09 a.m., while Apis. mellifera L. concentrated its visits from 10h to 11h a.m. In organic cultivation, T. spinipes was registered at all times collecting nectar, while the visits of Xylocopa grisescens Lepeletier were registered only early in the morning.

Current research on hormone-mediated neurometamorphosis is focused on discovering the molecular mechanisms that account for the cell- and stage-specific details of responses to these hormones. Yet these developmental hormones, and the receptors through which they signal, are also present in adults.

This paper deals with variations in morphological features and secretion production of the CSG of females and males of Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758 and Scaptotrigona postica Latreille, 1807. The following life stages were studied: newly emerged, nurse, and forager workers; newly emerged and egg-laying queens; and newly emerged and sexually mature males. The histological results showed that the CSG differs between the two species in the following features: while alveoli and duct cells are cuboidal in workers and queens of A. mellifera, they change from cuboidal to flat in S. postica as the workers age. The glands of newly emerged males and females of A. mellifera are similar. However, as males become sexually mature, glands degenerate and practically disappear. The secretion from the glands of females of both species is oleaginous and gradually accumulates in the lumen of the alveoli in the beginning of the adult phase. Consequently, forager workers and egg-laying queens exhibit more turgid alveoli than younger individuals. Sudan black and Nile's blue staining indicated that the CSG secretion consists of neutral lipids. The possible role of gland secretion is discussed taking in account tasks performed by the individuals in the particular phases studied. © 2010 Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia.

The objective of the present work was to verify the guild structure of bees that visit this plant, studying the richness and abundance of species and foraging patterns. The floral visitors were accompanied in 2005 and 2006, during the flowering period, from October to December, in three areas of the cerrado with different sizes and with lower or higher natural vegetation covering. Bees were collected fortnightly, with entomological net, by two collectors. Six samples were carried out in 2005 during 8 hours a day, and five samples were carried out in 2006 during 4 hours a day. In the first stage 1,516 bees from 80 species were sampled, with the dominance of 24 species (30%). In the second stage 562 individuals from 66 species were sampled, with the dominance of 10 species (15%). Bees were from five Apoidea families, in a total of 105 species and 2078 individuals. Apidae was the most common family both in number of species and number of individuals. The predominance of Apidae in relation to the number of individuals occurred mainly due to two eusocial species, Apis mellifera and Scaptotrigona depilis. Other abundant species were Rophitulus sp., Tetragonisca angustula and Scaptotrigona polysticta. Apis mellifera was predominant on the three sampled areas. The most abundant bee species presented non- coincidental activity peaks, but there was not a foraging pattern of resource division. The pattern found on the guild structure of bees which visit Matayba guianensis was in accordance with the general pattern related to the dominance of Apidae on the Cerrado environment. In relation to species distribution, there was a small number of species with great abundance of individuals, and a great number of rare species with few individuals.","Abundance; Apoidea; Foraging; Rare and dominant species; Richness",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856493079

The species are synchronopatric, distylic, and self-incompatible. Though they share melittophilous traits, the main visitor and pollinator of C. globosa was the generalist and exotic bee Apis mellifera, while the only one of C. leucocephala was the oligoletic bee Ceblurgus longipalpis. These two latter species are restricted to the Caatinga of NE Brazil, contrasting with the wide distribution of Cordia globosa. While the fruit-set for C. globosa was high, independently if the pollen donor/stigma receptor was a pin (long-styled) or thrum (short-styled) individual, in C. leucocephala the fruit-set was low and occurred only when a thrum individual was the pollen donor. This raises the possibility of this species moving towards dioecy. The high natural fruit-set of C. globosa confirms the generalist bee as its effective pollinator. The low fruit-set after manual crosses in C. leucocephala may be due to low pollen viability. Additionally, the low natural fruit-set (two times lower than after crosses) may be related with the foraging behavior of the specialist pollinator.","Apis mellifera; Caatinga; Ceblurgus longipalpis; Cordia globosa; Cordia leucocephala; Dry forest; Heterostyly; Oligolecty",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650553223

They consist of five subunits arranged around a central ion channel. Since the subunit composition determines the functional and pharmacological properties of the receptor the presence of nAChR families comprising several subunit-encoding genes provides a molecular basis for broad functional diversity. Analyses of genome sequences have shown that nAChR gene families remain compact in diverse insect species, when compared to their nematode and vertebrate counterparts. Thus, the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), malaria mosquito (Anopheles gambiae), honey bee (Apis mellifera), silk worm (Bombyx mori) and the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) possess 10-12 nAChR genes while human and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have 16 and 29 respectively. Although insect nAChR gene families are amongst the smallest known, receptor diversity can be considerably increased by the posttranscriptional processes alternative splicing and mRNA A-to-I editing which can potentially generate protein products which far outnumber the nAChR genes. These two processes can also generate species-specific subunit isoforms. In addition, each insect possesses at least one highly divergent nAChR subunit which may perform species-specific functions. Species-specific subunit diversification may offer promising targets for future rational design of insecticides that target specific pest insects while sparing beneficial species. © 2010 Landes Bioscience and Springer Science+Business Media.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958059025

Workers perform nest tasks, like nursing larvae, prior to field tasks, like foraging. Despite worker sterility, this behavioral progression correlates with ovary size: workers with larger ovaries (many ovary filaments) start foraging at younger ages on average. It is untested, however, whether the correlation confers a causal relationship between ovary size and behavioral development. Here, we successfully grafted supernumerary ovaries into worker bees to produce an artificial increase in the amount of ovary tissue. We next measured fat body mRNA levels for the yolk precursor gene vitellogenin, which influences honey bee behavioral development and can correlate with ovary size. Vitellogenin was equally expressed in surgical controls and bees with supernumerary ovaries, leading us to predict that these groups would be characterized by equal behavior. Contrary to our prediction, bees with supernumerary ovaries showed accelerated behavioral development compared to surgical controls, which behaved like reference bees that were not treated surgically. To explore this result we monitored fat body expression levels of a putative ecdysteroid-response gene, HR46, which is genetically linked to ovary size in workers. Our data establish that social insect worker behavior can be directly influenced by ovaries, and that HR46 expression changes with ovary size independent of vitellogenin. © 2010.","Behavioral development; Division of labor; HR46; Ovary size; Sterility; Tissue grafting; Vitellogenin; Worker bee",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958507393

In the Northeastern United States, the primary insect pest is the striped cucumber beetle, Acalymma vittatum F. Using a Blue Hubbard squash (Cucurbita maxima Duchesne) perimeter trap crop system can reduce insecticide use by >90% in butternut squash (C. moschata Poir), the primary winter squash grown in this region. Despite the savings in insecticide costs, growers may be reluctant to give up field space for a perimeter crop of Blue Hubbard squash, which comprises only 5% of the winter squash market in New England as compared with 19% for buttercup squash. Finding a more marketable trap crop would lower the barrier for adoption of this system. We tested eight varieties of three species of cucurbits for attractiveness to beetles relative to Blue Hubbard and butternut squash, and chose buttercup squash as the most promising replacement. We compared the effect of a buttercup border, Blue Hubbard border, or control (no border) on beetle numbers, herbivory, insecticide use, pollination, and pollen limitation in the main crop. We found that buttercup squash performed equally well as Blue Hubbard as a trap crop, with 97% reduction in total insecticide use compared with control fields. Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) and squash bees (Peponapis pruinosa Say) were the predominant pollinators, and border treatments did not affect visitation. Hand pollination did not increase reproduction or yield, indicating that natural pollination was sufficient for full yield. This study confirms the effectiveness of perimeter trap crop systems and offers growers a more marketable trap crop for managing cucumber beetle damage. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.","Acalymma vittatum; butternut squash; Cucurbita maxima; integrated pest management (IPM); pollination",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251491059

The three mammalian ERR genes have been implicated in diverse physiological processes ranging from placental development to maintenance of bone density, but the function and regulation of ERRs in invertebrates are not well understood. A homologue of human ERR was isolated from the cricket Teleogryllus emma (Ohmachi and Matsumura) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). The full-length cDNA of T. emma ERR, termed TeERR, has 1618 base pair (bp) and contains a 5'-untranslated region of 140 bp and a 3'-untranslated region of 272 bp. The open reading frame of TeERR encodes a deduced 401 amino acid peptide with a predicted molecular mass of 45.75 kilodaltons. The results of sequence alignments indicate that the TeERR protein shares an overall identity of 65%-82% with other known ERR homologues, and is most closely related to that of Nasonia vitripennis (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) and Apis mellifera (Apidae). Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to compare the TeERR mRNA expression level at the whole body and gonad during T. emma development. The data revealed that TeERR mRNA is differentially expressed during T. emma development, with the highest expression level in embryos and the lowest in the body of late-instar larvae. The levels of TeERR transcripts also varied throughout gonad development; interestingly testicles had higher higher expression levels than ovaries at every development stage. These results suggest that TeERR has potential significance in the regulation of development in T. emma, due to its expression during different developmental periods.","cDNA cloning; developmental expression",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551626453

Consequently, their pollination service may also be influenced by the presence of other flower visiting species. Ants are solely interested in nectar and frequent flower visitors of some plant species but usually provide no pollination service. Obligate flower visitors such as bees depend on both nectar and pollen and are often more effective pollinators.In Hawaii, we studied the complex interactions between flowers of the endemic tree Metrosideros polymorpha (Myrtaceae) and both, endemic and introduced flower-visiting insects. The former main-pollinators of M. polymorpha were birds, which, however, became rare. We evaluated the pollinator effectiveness of endemic and invasive bees and whether it is affected by the type of resource collected and the presence of ants on flowers.Ants were dominant nectar-consumers that mostly depleted the nectar of visited inflorescences. Accordingly, the visitation frequency, duration, and consequently the pollinator effectiveness of nectar-foraging honeybees (Apis mellifera) strongly decreased on ant-visited flowers, whereas pollen-collecting bees remained largely unaffected by ants. Overall, endemic bees (Hylaeus spp.) were ineffective pollinators.The average net effect of ants on pollination of M. polymorpha was neutral, corresponding to a similar fruit set of ant-visited and ant-free inflorescences.Our results suggest that invasive social hymenopterans that often have negative impacts on the Hawaiian flora and fauna may occasionally provide neutral (ants) or even beneficial net effects (honeybees), especially in the absence of native birds. © 2010 The Authors.

The main pollinators are bees, which represent over 70% of pollinators of cultivated plants. However, only about a dozen species are managed for this purpose, and Apis mellifera is the main species used. The reports of pollinator decline indicated a global pollination crisis and triggered initiatives for conservation and sustainable use of pollinators around the world, encouraging detailed studies of crop pollination and native pollinators. However, there are authors who question the real requirements of biotic pollinators for world production of food, since most of these crops is autogamous or pollinated by wind. Detailed analysis circuscribed some cultures essentially dependent on biotic pollinators for their production. If such crops are not as important in terms of production value, they seem to be vital to maintaining the diversity of food habits and local cultures. These recent meta-analysis studies also showed the dependence of pollination services in relation to pollinator diversity and the conservation of areas surrounding such crop plantations. However, studies in this direction, especially in Brazil are restricted to a few crops and production areas. Passion fruit, Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa Deneger (Passifloraceae) in Triângulo Mineiro Region was used as a crop model to analyze aspects of the conservation of natural areas and the pollination service. This interaction involves a self-incompatible crop that needs pollination of large bees for fruit production, especially bees of the genus Xylocopa, with solitary habit, which nest in wood. In addition, the study area is among the areas of highest human pressure in the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna), with estimates of degradation up to 92% of the original vegetation. The results for the region showed natural productivity of the crop (about 25%) was higher than the values considered economically viable (20%), which may be explained by the relatively higher species richness of pollinators when compared to other regions of Brazil. Nevertheless, those results showed no relation with the remnants of natural areas of Cerrado in the surrounding crop, indicating the necessity for more research effort on this aspect.","Bees; Cerrado; Native pollinators; Passiflora",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856538390

The long-term persistence of fragmented plant populations is predicted to be threatened by a loss of genetic variability and increasing inbreeding, which might lower offspring fitness through inbreeding depression. Assessing plant progeny performance together with measurements of genetic diversity and mating patterns is therefore essential in the understanding of the role of the historical (i.e. genetic diversity in adults) and contemporary (i.e. current mating patterns) genetic effects of fragmentation on inbreeding depression, thus, on recruitment potential. 2. We evaluated genetic diversity, mating patterns and progeny performance at different life stages in seven populations of a Mediterranean shrub (myrtle Myrtus communis) that differed in size and degree of isolation (Large, Small-connected and Small-isolated populations). The study was conducted in the Guadalquivir Valley (SW Spain), a chronically and severely fragmented landscape characterized by c. 1% of woodland cover. 3. Parameters of genetic diversity (A r, H o and H e) of adult plants were in general higher in the Large populations than in the two types of Small populations, which were similar. Outcrossing rates were higher in Small-connected populations (mean: t m = 0.62), intermediate in Large (t m = 0.35) and lower in Small-isolated populations (t m = 0.13), and were positively correlated with the genetic diversity of progenies. 4. Several measurements of progeny performance were higher in Small-connected populations, intermediate in Large and lower in Small-isolated populations, in particular those related with the quantity of viable seedlings produced (germination and survival). Outcrossing rates rather than the genetic diversity of adult plants were positively correlated with these measurements of progeny performance. 5. We thus conclude that contemporary mating patterns (outcrossing rates) have a more critical influence on progeny performance than either population fragmentation or the historical levels of genetic diversity. 6. Synthesis and applications. It may be possible to enhance either the fitness or certain levels of genetic diversity in progenies by promoting outcrossed matings in fragmented populations of self-compatible plant species.

Insects with biological-control potential recorded at the EFNs included ants, wasps and ladybird beetles. Ants, comprising ten species, constituted by far the most abundant group (84.44 ± 4.34 % of individuals) at the EFNs. Insect pollinators included honey bees, butterflies and wasps, which, while visiting the floral nectaries (FNs), also visited the EFNs. Ants were found in large numbers on EFN-bearing plant parts, particularly leaves and calyces. Aggressive and abundant ant species visiting the plants included Camponotus compressus, C. paria and Pheidole sp. The major insect herbivore was the red pumpkin beetle, Raphidopalpa foveicollis Lucas, which fed predominantly on the corolla of the plants and, to a lesser extent, on each of the EFN-bearing vegetative parts. The low abundance of herbivores on vegetative parts indicates that the ants and, to a lesser extent, wasps, bees and ladybirds visiting the EFN-bearing plant structures may be aiding in crop plant protection from the herbivores. Thus, though the EFNs of sponge gourd plants attract predators, pollinators and also extrafloral nectar thieves such as flies, ants are the major group involved in the facultative association with the annual crop plant. Such studies may aid an environmentally-friendly management approach involving the natural enemies of insect pests of EFN-bearing annual crop plants. © Vivek Mohan Agarwal and Neelkamal Rastogi.","Ants; Extrafloral nectaries; Insect visitors; Sponge gourd plant",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866296238

However, little is known about the population dynamics of the beetle in its native host range. Similarly baited Langstroth hive bottom board traps were used to monitor the occurrence and seasonal abundance of the beetle in honey bee colonies at two beekeeping locations in Kenya. Trap captures indicated that the beetle was present in honey bee colonies in low numbers all year round, but it was most abundant during the rainy season, with over 80% trapped during this period. The survival of larvae was tested in field releases under dry and wet soil conditions, and predators of larvae were identified. The actvity and survival of the beetle were strongly influenced by a combination of abiotic and biotic factors. Larval survival was higher during wet (28%) than dry (1.1%) conditions, with pupation occurring mostly at 0-15 cm and 11-20 cm, respectively, beneath the surface soil during these periods. The ant Pheidole megacephala was identified as a key predator of larvae at this site, and more active during the dry than wet seasons. These observations imply that intensive trapping during the rainy season could reduce the population of beetles infesting hives in subsequent seasons especially in places where the beetle is a serious pest. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.","Aethina tumida; honey bee; Kenya; Kodamaea ohmeri; Pheidole megacephala",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251517425

The study was conducted in 14 stationary apiaries situated in southeastern Opole Province (Poland) in autumn 2007 and in spring, summer and autumn 2008. Samples were mineralized using microwave method. Quantitative analysis of studied metals in bees' bodies and multiflower honey were done using the plasma spectrometry method (ICP). It was found that copper was an element present in bodies of worker bees in the highest concentration. Its mean content was 22.6 mg·kg -1 d.m. Next was selenium - 7.03, lead - 1.95 and cadmium - 0.65 mg·kg -1 d.m. The highest level of Cu, Pb and Cd accumulation (means on a level of 24.5, 2.59 and 0.83 mg·kg -1 d.m., respectively) was observed in samples of bees obtained during spring 2008, and of selenium in autumn 2008.

In most cases, the differences in contents of particular metals between periods of sample collection were significant (p≤0.05) or highly significant (p≤0.01) statistically. Higher concentrations of copper (23.3 in comparison to 22.0 mg·kg -1 d.m.), selenium (7.58 in comparison to 6.48 mg·kg -1 d.m.), and lead (1.98 in comparison to 1.91 mg·kg -1 d.m.) were demonstrated in bees from urbanized regions, while cadmium (0.70 in comparison to 0.60 mg·kg -1 d.m.) in those from agricultural-woodland. The sequence of the range of analyzed metals accumulation in honey was the same as in the case of bees, but concentrations were manyfold lower: Cu - 0.82, Se - 0.38, Pb - 0.06 and Cd - 0.06 mg·kg -1 d.m).

The genome sequencing of diverse insect species has demonstrated the existence of at least 10 nAChR genes coding for α and β subunits, suggesting the existence in the insect CNS of several subtypes of nAChRs whose molecular composition and pharmacological properties are still unknown. Insect nAChRs have given rise to an abundance of literature about their sensitivity to neonicotinoid insecticides but only limited data are available on the functional role of nAChRs in insect cognitive functions. The data we have collected on honeybees are the only data that shed light on the role of nAChRs in learning and memory processes. The behavioral response of proboscis extension (PER), which appears when the honeybee perceives sugar, was used to quantify learning and memory performances in associative and non-associative learning procedures. Habituation of the PER, which consists in ceasing to respond to sucrose upon repetitive antennal sucrose stimulation, was facilitated by the injection into the brain of one of the nicotinic antagonists mecamylamine, alpha-bungarotoxin (α-BGT) or methyllycaconitine (MLA). Pavlovian associative protocol was used to condition the PER to olfactory or tactile stimulus after single- or multiple-trial training. Localized brain injections of the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine were performed before or after one-trial olfactory learning in the mushroom bodies (MB), the integrative structures of the insect brain. The results showed that the calical input structures of the MB are necessary for the acquisition processes and the output α-lobe regions are involved in retrieval processes. Brain injection of one of the three nicotinic antagonists mecamylamine, α-BGT and MLA was combined with single- and multiple-trial olfactory and tactile learning and memory performances were evaluated at long- or short-term intervals. Mecamylamine impaired the acquisition of one-trial learning and the retrieval of information, regardless of the number of trials during training and the learning modality (olfactory or tactile cues used as conditioned stimulus). Memory performance evaluated at long-term intervals was decreased by injection of α-BGT and MLA in multiple-trial olfactory and tactile experiments. We conclude from these results that at least two subtypes of nAChRs exist in the honeybee brain. The α-BGT-sensitive nAChRs are necessary for the formation of long-term memory and the α-BGT-insensitive nAChRs are involved in one-trial acquisition and in retrieval processes. The hypothesis is put forward that multiple-trial associative learning triggers activation of the α-BGT-sensitive nAChRs that, in turn, activate intracellular events leading to LTM formation. © 2010 Landes Bioscience and Springer Science+Business Media.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79151478162

The objective of the present research was to evaluate phenols and antioxidant activity of propolis samples collected in three main areas of Algarve, South of Portugal. Water revealed to be less effective for extracting phenolic compounds from propolis than the methanol and water/ethanol. The last two were good extraction solvents of phenols. Nevertheless water/ethanol was the solvent chosen because it was able to extract phenols in considerable amounts being less toxic than methanol.In spring, higher amounts of phenols (total phenols, flavones, flavonols, flavanones and dihydroflavonols) were detected in hydro-alcoholic extracts of propolis than in winter.Among the three main areas of Algarve where samples were collected, those from Barrocal had the highest levels of polyphenols, independent on the season (winter or spring). Within each area, the levels of phenols changed according to the zone.Concerning antioxidant activity, samples from Barrocal presented better radical scavenging abilities than those from the remaining areas, independent on the antioxidant method and collection season. Such results correlated closely with the levels of total phenols, flavones and flavonols in samples. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Algarve; Antioxidant activity; Phenols; Propolis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049425847

In honeybees, this visual estimate of speed is largely independent of both the direction of motion and the spatial frequency content of the image. Electrophysiological recordings from the motion-sensitive cells believed to underlie these behaviors have long supported spatio-temporally tuned correlation-type models of visual motion detection whose speed tuning changes as the spatial frequency of a stimulus is varied. The result is an apparent conflict between behavioral experiments and the electrophysiological and modeling data. In this article, we demonstrate that conventional correlation-type models are sufficient to reproduce some of the speed-dependent behaviors observed in honeybees when square wave gratings are used, contrary to the theoretical predictions. However, these models fail to match the behavioral observations for sinusoidal stimuli. Instead, we show that non-directional motion detectors, which underlie the correlation-based computation of directional motion, can be used to mimic these same behaviors even when narrowband gratings are used. The existence of such non-directional motion detectors is supported both anatomically and electrophysiologically, and they have been hypothesized to be critical in the Dipteran elementary motion detector (EMD) circuit. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Computational modeling; Motion detection; Optic flow; Speed estimation; Vision",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79151479495

The ultimate goal is to document not only the morphological network properties of neurons collected from separate brains, but also to establish a graphical user interface for a neuron-related data base. Here, we review the current methods and protocols used to incorporate neuronal reconstructions into the HSB. Our registration protocol consists of two separate steps applied to imaging data from two-channel confocal microscopy scans: (1) The reconstruction of the neuron, facilitated by an automatic extraction of the neuron's skeleton based on threshold segmentation, and (2) the semi-automatic 3D segmentation of the neuropils and their registration with the HSB. The integration of neurons in the HSB is performed by applying the transformation computed in step (2) to the reconstructed neurons of step (1). The most critical issue of this protocol in terms of user interaction time-the segmentation process - is drastically improved by the use of a model-based segmentation process. Furthermore, the underlying statistical shape models (SSM) allow the visualization and analysis of characteristic variations in large sets of bee brain data. The anatomy of neural networks composed of multiple neurons that are registered into the HSB are visualized by depicting the 3D reconstructions together with semantic information with the objective to integrate data from multiple sources (electrophysiology, imaging, immunocytochemistry, molecular biology). Ultimately, this will allow the user to specify cell types and retrieve their morphologies along with physiological characterizations. © 2010 Rybak, Ku?, Lamecker, Zachow, Hege, Lienhard, Singer, Neubert and Menzel.","Apis mellifera; Brain atlas; Confocal microscopy; Image registration; Neural networks; Neuron reconstruction; Ontology; Statistical shape model",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957921838

Unfruitfulness in fruit crops refers to the state where the plant is not capable of flowering and bearing fruit. However, the causes of unfruitfulness can be broadly grouped into two categories: Internal and external factors. Among the internal factors, dichogamy prevents self pollination in perfect as well as monoecious flowers. The occurrence of flowers with variable style length (heterostyly) is common in Prunus fruits. The proportion of aborted pollen grains varied from 22.5 to 48.0% in cashewnut. In apricot cv. 'Trevatt Blue', multiple ovules and anthers with degenerated microspores resulted in both female and male sterility and in 'Tokaloglu', the reason for unfruitfulness is self incompatibility (Gulcan and Askin, 1991). External factors, like temperature that is above 32°C, result in desiccation of stigmatic surface and more rapid deterioration of embryo sac occurrence. For high productivity in delicious apple plant diploid, self-fruitful and compatible varieties ensure cross pollination. Sequential introduction of honeybee increases fruit set and yield of 'Spadona' pear by about 50 to 80%. Foliar application of boron at a concentration of 200 mgl-1 increases pollen germination rate and tube growth in pear. ©2010 Academic Journals.","External factors; Fruit crops; Internal factors; Unfruitfulness",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251563160

In fact, more than 3.5 million beehives and 50 000 beekeepers are related with this production, mainly located in Buenos Aires province. Honeybee mortality is a serious problem that beekeepers in Argentina have had to face during the last 3 years. It is known that the consequence of the complex interactions between environmental and beekeeping parameters added to the effect of different disease agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasitic mites may result in a sudden collapse of the colony. In addition, multiple viral infections are frequently detected concomitantly in bee colonies. We describe here the preliminary results of a survey of three honeybee-pathogenic viruses, acute bee paralysis viruses (ABPV), chronic bee paralysis viruses (CBPV) and Sacbrood viruses (SBV) detected during a screening of 61 apiaries located in the main honey producer province using a RT-PCR assay.

The exploitation and utilization of insect resources is broadly classified into four different categories. The first category is the insects of industrial resources. This level includes the utilization of silk worm, honeybee, lac insect, dye insect, and aesthetic insect. The second category is the utilization of insects for edible and therapeutic purposes. Insects are high in protein and many are rich sources of vitamins and minerals. The third category is the use of insects in forensic investigation. By analyzing the stages of succession of insects at first, rough estimation of the postmortem intervals can be done. The fourth category is the insects of ecological importance. Many insect species act as potential predators and parasites of destructive pests of insect order Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Orthoptera. Insects are also used as bioindicator to assess the cumulative effects of environmental stressors such as pollutants. Despites these fascinating benefits, insect resources are often neglected in India due to lack of proper documentation, less expertise, and advance enterprises in these fields.

Beekeepers between 35 and 50 years old were 29.5%, while the youngest group, under 35, were only 9.8%. In recent years, there has been a fall in honey production resulting from unfavourable changes in regional climatic conditions, altered land management and cases of mass die-offs of honeybee colonies in apiaries. In 2008, honey production was about 18 thousand tonnes. In the season of 2009, only 14 thousand tonnes of honey were produced. It was the poorest in Polish honey production in the last few years. The proportion of prices to costs of production was still unfavourable.

It deals with the molecular mechanisms orchestrating chromatin remodelling, which leads to gene transcription or silencing. Here, we provide evidence from the published scientific literature that the epigenetic marks are apposed onto the genome in a sequential, reversible and/or inheritable manner. These marks can be finely measured to characterise the epigenome. The functional analysis of the epigenetic processes provides support to the two associated concepts of genome flexibility and robustness. Genome flexibility is involved in the acquisition of cell identity during differentiation (Why do not the various cellular types of an organism use the same genetic information in a similar manner?), and in the adaptation to environmental cues as illustrated by the mechanism underlying the fate of honeybees that become fertile queens or sterile workers. But the epigenome is also crucial for the development of individuals that requires the robustness of epigenetic marks as exemplified from parental imprinting studies. The flexibility of epigenetic marks is associated with transitory adaptation to environmental changes while robustness reveals long term processes associated with more stable marks that in some instances can pass over several generations. This review points to the importance of epigenetic processes for genome functions and proposes that the integration of the molecular data describing the epigenomic states could be considered as new variables in selection to preserve the sustainability of animal breeding.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958029315

According to the production data of 2008, sunflower was produced on 577,958 ha and 992,000 metric tons of sunflower seed were harvested in Turkey (Anonymous, 2010). Because of the gap in vegetable oil production in Turkey, sunflower is one of the alternative and leading oilseed crops for Increasing vegetable oil production. One possibility for increasing this production Is for sunflower to also be grown as the second crop in the Aegean Region. The mission of the Oilseed Research Project at the Aegean Agricultural Research Institute (AARI) is to reduce the cost of sunflower production by improving well adapted and high yielding varieties. A number of different approaches are utilized to achieve this goal. Improved germplasm for hybrid development and breeding lines of oilseed and confectionary type of sunflower germplasm (A, B and Rf lines) and also improved populations have been developed by conventional breeding techniques. To improve sunflower varieties with desired characters, genetic investigations and germplasm development of sunflower with improved yield, oil quality, resistance to disease [Sunflower rust (Pucctnia heltanthl Schw.)), insect, Orobanche sp., and adverse conditions are under consideration. The research program is aiming to develop oilseed and confectionary type of sunflowers for both the first and second crop production seasons. Sunflower germplasm has been developed from sources such as cultlvars, populations created through breeding methods, or inter-specific crosses with wild germplasm and then tested for general and specific combining abilities, oil percentage, and resistance to prevalent disease and adverse conditions to construct improved varieties. For hybrid variety development, combining ability studies in oilseed and confectionary sunflower breeding program were undertaken with line x tester analysis. More than 2000 lines, candidate varieties, and commercial varieties were evaluated in preliminary and yield trials In the first and second crop produc-Hon seasons. Variety performance tests and yield trials Indicated that sunflower can be grown with satisfactory yield performance (approximately 500-550 kg da -1) in both the first and second crop production seasons In the Aegean Region of Turkey. Improvement of oilseed and confectionary types of sunflower parental germplasms (A, B and Rf lines) including hybrid and open pollinated varieties has been carried out. The oilseed type of the open-pollinated variety Ege-2001 was developed by the S 0:1 generation testing method (modified recurrent selection) and has been registered. Effects of plant population, planting time, fertilizing, irrigation, and honeybee pollination on seed yield, oil percentage and other plant characteristics and silage quality of sunflower (Hellanthus annuus L.) were determined. Sunflower rust (Pucclnla heltanthl Schw.) race identification was performed under field conditions.","Adaptation; Agronomy; Breeding; Cms line; Confectionary; Genetics; Germplasm; Helianthus spp; Hellanthus annuus L; Hybrid variety; Insects and weeds; Oilseed; Open pollinated variety; Restorer line; Sunflower; Sunflower diseases; Technology; Yield components",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053037454

The current study examines the relative contribution of honeybees, three bumble bee species, and three solitary bee species to pollination and gene flow in alfalfa. Two wild solitary bee species and one wild bumble bee species were best at tripping flowers, while the two managed pollinators commonly used in alfalfa seed production, honeybees and leaf cutting bees, had the lowest tripping rate. Honeybees had the greatest potential for gene flow and risk of transgene escape relative to the other pollinators.

The quality of diet influences colony health and strength, especially for colonies preparing for overwintering or starting population build-up in early spring. The palatability of four feeds to honeybees and their effects on colony performance were assessed by three independent feeding experiments made in late fall and early spring with experimental and commercial honeybee colonies in southern Ontario, Canada. The colonies were supplied with patties of bee-collected pollen, Bee-Pro®, TLS Bee food, or Feedbee® or no supplementary feed as the control. The first trial in late fall 2003 used 21 equalized experimental colonies receiving Feedbee®, pollen, or Bee-Pro® for 33 days. The feed consumption for Feedbee® and pollen were both higher than for Bee-Pro®. The second trial used 24 equalized experimental colonies in early spring 2004 for 30 days. Then, feed consumption for Feedbee® and pollen were again both higher than for Bee-Pro®. Also measured in these trials were capped brood area, bee population, and honey production. Results for all three response variables were similar between Feedbee® and pollen, and significantly higher than Bee-Pro® and controls. The third trial used 33 commercially operated colonies (in 2 independent apiaries) that received Feedbee®, Bee-Pro® and TLS Bee food in fall 2004 for 30 days. The results showed Feedbee® had greater consumption than the other two feeds. In all three experiments and for all parameters there were no significant differences between feeding Feedbee® and pollen.

In this work, first the CABC algorithm is used for optimizing six widely used benchmark functions and the comparative results produced by ABC, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and its cooperative version (CPSO) are studied. Second, the CABC algorithm is used for data clustering on several benchmark data sets. The performance of CABC algorithm is compared with PSO, CPSO, and ABC algorithms on clustering problems.

Allergologists seek evidence of the effectiveness of bee venom immunotherapy as this approach is the chosen treatment for systemic allergic reactions. The effect of bee venom on human basophils in vitro has not been studied in detail for many reasons, including the paucity of basophils in peripheral blood, inter-individual basophil response variability, and the reliability and predictability of basophil activation tests. We conducted a brief preliminary survey of the effect of Apis bee venom on healthy asymptomatic (non-allergic) subjects. A dose of an aqueous commercial extract of Apis bee venom as high as 10 μg/mL activated resting basophils (CD63=+80-90%, CD203c=+30%), while it inhibited the expression of CD63 (-50%) following basophil stimulation by the soluble agonists formyl-Met-Leu-Phe or anti-IgE. The activation of resting basophils appeared to be dose-related. Only when basophils were activated with an IgE-mediated agonist, did bee venom extract exhibit a possible priming mechanism at the lowest doses used only via CD63, while it was ineffective via CD203c.

Mushroom bodies (MBs) are insect brain structures that are important for higher-order sensory processing of different sensory modalities. Honeybee MB function is thought to be closely associated with honeybee social behavior for the following reasons: (1) The MBs of the aculeate Hymenoptera, including the honeybee, are more prominent compared with those of other insects. (2) Honeybee MBs have a high degree of structural plasticity and the volume of the neuropil varies according to the division of labor. Recently, genes expressed preferentially in the MBs of the honeybee brain were identified using molecular biologic techniques (e.g., differential display method, cDNA microarray, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization with time-of-flight mass spectometry). These genes were classified into three groups according to the function of the proteins encoded: Ca2+-signaling pathway, ecdysteroid-regulated transcription factors, and neuropeptide precursor protein. In this article, the expression pattern and possible function of these genes in honeybee MBs is described in comparison with those of their orthologues in other insects. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

With both shrimp and commercial insects such as honey bees, it is known that stable, persistent viral infections characterized by absence of disease can sometimes shift to overt disease states as a result of various stress triggers and that this can result in serious economic losses. The main research interest of our group is to understand the dynamics of stable viral infections in shrimp and how they can be destabilized by stress. Since there are no continuous cell lines for crustaceans, we have used a C6/36 mosquito cell line infected with Dengue virus to test hypotheses regarding these interactions. As a result, we accidentally discovered two new cytokine-like substances in 5 kDa extracts from supernatant solutions of acutely and persistently infected mosquito cells. Results. Nave C6/36 cells were exposed for 48 h to 5 kDa membrane filtrates prepared from the supernatant medium of stable C6/36 mosquito cell cultures persistently-infected with Dengue virus. Subsequent challenge of nave cells with a virulent stock of Dengue virus 2 (DEN-2) and analysis by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-DEN-2 antibody revealed a dramatic reduction in the percentage of DEN-2 infected cells when compared to control cells. Similar filtrates prepared from C6/36 cells with acute DEN-2 infections were used to treat stable C6/36 mosquito cell cultures persistently-infected with Dengue virus. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed destabilization in the form of an apoptosis-like response. Proteinase K treatment removed the cell-altering activities indicating that they were caused by small polypeptides similar to those previously reported from insects. Conclusions. This is the first report of cytokine-like substances that can alter the responses of mosquito cells to Dengue virus. This simple model system allows detailed molecular studies on insect cytokine production and on cytokine activity in a standard insect cell line. © 2010 Kanthong et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149492915

The queen is larger in size and fully developed sexually, while the worker bees are smaller in size and nearly infertile. To better understand the specific time and underlying molecular mechanisms of caste differentiation, the proteomic profiles of larvae intended to grow into queen and worker castes were compared at 72 and 120 hours using two dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), network, enrichment and quantitative PCR analysis. There were significant differences in protein expression between the two larvae castes at 72 and 120 hours, suggesting the queen and the worker larvae have already decided their fate before 72 hours. Specifically, at 72 hours, queen intended larvae over-expressed transketolase, aldehyde reductase, and enolase proteins which are involved in carbohydrate metabolism and energy production, imaginal disc growth factor 4 which is a developmental related protein, long-chain-fatty-acid CoA ligase and proteasome subunit alpha type 5 which metabolize fatty and amino acids, while worker intended larvae over-expressed ATP synthase beta subunit, aldehyde dehydrogenase, thioredoxin peroxidase 1 and peroxiredoxin 2540, lethal (2) 37 and 14-3-3 protein epsilon, fatty acid binding protein, and translational controlled tumor protein. This differential protein expression between the two caste intended larvae was more pronounced at 120 hours, with particular significant differences in proteins associated with carbohydrate metabolism and energy production. Functional enrichment analysis suggests that carbohydrate metabolism and energy production and antioxidation proteins play major roles in the formation of caste divergence. The constructed network and validated gene expression identified target proteins for further functional study. This new finding is in contrast to the existing notion that 72 hour old larvae has bipotential and can develop into either queen or worker based on epigenetics and can help us to gain new insight into the time of departure as well as caste trajectory influencing elements at the molecular level. © 2010 Li et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149428983

A brood ester pheromone produced primarily by old larvae (4 and 5 days old larvae) was first identified as acting as a contact pheromone with specific effects on nurses in the colony. More recently a new volatile brood pheromone has been identified: E-β-ocimene, which partially inhibits ovary development in workers. Methodology and Principal Finding: Our analysis of E-β-ocimene production revealed that young brood (newly hatched to 3 days old) produce the highest quantity of E-β-ocimene relative to their body weight. By testing the potential action of this molecule as a non-specific larval signal, due to its high volatility in the colony, we demonstrated that in the presence of E-β- ocimene nest workers start to forage earlier in life, as seen in the presence of real brood. Conclusions/Significance: In this way, young larvae are able to assign precedence to the task of foraging by workers in order to increase food stores for their own development. Thus, in the complexity of honey bee chemical communication, E-β-ocimene, a pheromone of young larvae, provides the brood with the means to express their nutritional needs to the workers. © 2010 Maisonnasse et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149438175

This adjustment is generally associated with the fact that individuals of different ages display different response thresholds to given stimuli, which determine specific behaviors. For instance, the sucrose-response threshold (SRT) which largely depends on genetic factors may also be affected by the nectar sugar content. However, it remains unknown whether SRTs in workers of different ages and tasks can differ depending on gustatory and olfactory experiences. Methodology: Groups of worker bees reared either in an artificial environment or else in a queen-right colony, were exposed to different reward conditions at different adult ages. Gustatory response scores (GRSs) and odor-memory retrieval were measured in bees that were previously exposed to changes in food characteristics. Principal Findings: Results show that the gustatory responses of pre-foraging-aged bees are affected by changes in sucrose solution concentration and also to the presence of an odor provided it is presented as scented sucrose solution. In contrast no differences in worker responses were observed when presented with odor only in the rearing environment. Fast modulation of GRSs was observed in older bees (12-16 days of age) which are commonly involved in food processing tasks within the hive, while slower modulation times were observed in younger bees (commonly nurse bees, 6-9 days of age). This suggests that older food-processing bees have a higher plasticity when responding to fluctuations in resource information than younger hive bees. Adjustments in the number of trophallaxis events were also found when scented food circulated inside the nest, and this was positively correlated with the differences in timing observed in gustatory responsiveness and memory retention for hive bees of different age classes. Conclusions: This work demonstrates the accessibility of chemosensory information in the honeybee colonies with respect to incoming nectar. The modulation of the sensory-response systems within the hive can have important effects on the dynamics of food transfer and information propagation. © 2010 Ramírez et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149423953

Studies of invertebrates have taught us much about the physiology of aging and how this progression may be slowed. Yet, how aging affects complex brain functions, e.g., the ability to acquire new memory when previous experience is no longer valid, is an almost exclusive question of studies in humans and mammalian models. In these systems, age related cognitive disorders are assessed through composite paradigms that test different performance tasks in the same individual. Such studies could demonstrate that afflicted individuals show the loss of several and often-diverse memory faculties, and that performance usually varies more between aged individuals, as compared to conspecifics from younger groups. No comparable composite surveying approaches are established yet for invertebrate models in aging research. Here we test whether an insect can share patterns of decline similar to those that are commonly observed during mammalian brain aging. Using honey bees, we combine restrained learning with free-flight assays. We demonstrate that reduced olfactory learning performance correlates with a reduced ability to extinguish the spatial memory of an abandoned nest location (spatial memory extinction). Adding to this, we show that learning performance is more variable in old honey bees. Taken together, our findings point to generic features of brain aging and provide the prerequisites to model individual aspects of learning dysfunction with insect models. © 2010 Münch et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149433909

The acceptance threshold of guards is known to change adaptively, for example becoming less permissive when the number of intruder bees from other colonies increases. These adaptive shifts can occur within minutes. What is unknown is the mechanism behind this rapid shift. It was hypothesized that alarm pheromones released by guards may cause the adoption of a less permissive acceptance threshold. Here, we tested this hypothesis on five discriminator hives by using a behavioral assay. We used three amounts each of iso-pentyl acetate (IPA) and 2-heptanone (2H), which are the major components of the pheromones from the sting and the mandibular glands, respectively. Biologically relevant levels of chemicals were delivered to the hive entrance platform via an air pump. We found no effect of either IPA or 2H: there was no change in guard acceptance of either nestmate (on average, 91% accepted) or non-nestmate (on average, 30% accepted) under any of the pheromone treatments compared to the pentane control (98% nestmates accepted and 32% non-nestmates accepted).

In a radish F1 seed production field using cytoplasmic male sterility system, visitation behaviors of different pollinator species and seed productivity of the recipient line were investigated in three stages during the flowering. As a result, honey bees (Apis mellifera and A. cerana) selectively visited either of two lines, while syrphid flies (various flies belonging to Syrphidae) tended to visit both lines. Despite the few observations of pollinator movements between the two lines, all flowers had received cross-pollen grains a few days after flowering. But in the late stage of flowering, increased cross-pollination by syrphid flies appeared to lead to an increase in the amount of crosspollen grains deposited on the stigmas. The percentage of pod set and the number of seeds per pod varied among the three stages of the flowering. These variations might be caused by shifts in the mount of crosspollen grains deposited on the stigmas due to the pollinators' selective visitation behaviors. The selective visitation behavior of insect pollinators could potentially result in unstable F1 seed production through the insufficient cross-pollination.","F1 seed production; Honey bee; Pollination efficiency; Pollinator; Radish; Selective visitation behavior; Syrphid fly",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049428471

A decrease in flowering intensity was followed by a decrease in honey bee density in both rape varieties. A strong increase in ambient temperature had a negative impact on the foraging of honey bees on flowering plants. The lowest honey bee density in the investigated rape plots was recorded in the afternoon, when air temperature reached +43°C.

Many CCD investigations, using sensitive genome-based methods, have found small RNA bee viruses and the microsporidia, Nosema apis and N. ceranae in healthy and collapsing colonies alike with no single pathogen firmly linked to honey bee losses. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used Mass spectrometry-based proteomics (MSP) to identify and quantify thousands of proteins from healthy and collapsing bee colonies. MSP revealed two unreported RNA viruses in North American honey bees, Varroa destructor-1 virus and Kakugo virus, and identified an invertebrate iridescent virus (IIV) (Iridoviridae) associated with CCD colonies. Prevalence of IIV significantly discriminated among strong, failing, and collapsed colonies. In addition, bees in failing colonies contained not only IIV, but also Nosema. Co-occurrence of these microbes consistently marked CCD in (1) bees from commercial apiaries sampled across the U.S. in 2006-2007, (2) bees sequentially sampled as the disorder progressed in an observation hive colony in 2008, and (3) bees from a recurrence of CCD in Florida in 2009. The pathogen pairing was not observed in samples from colonies with no history of CCD, namely bees from Australia and a large, nonmigratory beekeeping business in Montana. Laboratory cage trials with a strain of IIV type 6 and Nosema ceranae confirmed that co-infection with these two pathogens was more lethal to bees than either pathogen alone. Conclusions/Significance: These findings implicate co-infection by IIV and Nosema with honey bee colony decline, giving credence to older research pointing to IIV, interacting with Nosema and mites, as probable cause of bee losses in the USA, Europe, and Asia. We next need to characterize the IIV and Nosema that we detected and develop management practices to reduce honey bee losses.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049248014

Then, the morphological characteristics of unknown worker bee samples from the Turkeli area - where commercial queen bee usage is common - were investigated. The model showed that the area was subject to genetic mixing because of commercial queen usage. The subspecies of 15 unknown test samples were predicted with 100% confidence, and the native bees from 25 of 30 samples from the Turkeli area were successfully predicted using the model developed.

The source of one of the queen pheromones influencing worker reproduction has been located in the mandibular glands. In nonlaying workers, this gland's profile is dominated by fatty acids that are incorporated into the food given to the brood and to nest mates. After queen loss and onset of reproductive activity, workers are able to synthesize different fatty acids, which are normally only produced by queens and that contribute to their reproductive success. Apis mellifera capensis workers have the ability to rapidly produce queen-like mandibular profiles that could represent an important factor in their ability to behave as facultative intraspecific social parasites. Indeed, A. m. capensis workers can take over reproduction from the host queens in colonies of other subspecies. Here, we show that in the presence of their own queen, the mandibular gland profile of A. m. capensis workers is dominated by the precursor of the major compound of the queen pheromone. This is a unique trait among honeybee workers and suggests that A. m. capensis workers are primed for reproduction and that this phenomenon represents a pheromonal predisposition to social parasitism. We identified geographical variation in the ratio of queen- to worker-specific compounds in the mandibular gland profile of A. m. capensis workers, which corresponds with the introgression with the neighboring subspecies A. m. scutellata. © The Author 2010.

Most studies on the toxic effects of honeybee venom in experimental animals have been performed using the intravenous or intraperitoneal injection routes. The aim of this study was to develop a mouse model that would better resemble a massive honeybee attack by using the subcutaneous (s.c.) route to induce a severe, sublethal systemic envenoming. An array of acute venom effects were characterized, including biochemical, hematological, histological, and inflammatory alterations, after the s.c. injection of 0.5 median lethal dose of venom. Rapid increases in serum alanine (ALT) and aspartate (AST) transaminases, creatinine, urea nitrogen, uric acid, sodium and chloride electrolytes, and creatine kinase (CK) were recorded, indicating damage to liver, kidneys, and skeletal muscle. Also, coagulation disturbances (fibrinogen decrease, and moderate delay in prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times) were demonstrated. Circulating platelet and leukocyte numbers remained unaltered, but a hemoconcentration effect (hematocrit and hemoglobin increase) was observed. This effect might be related to the marked edema induced by the venom. In addition, this inflammatory response included a systemic increase in cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), together with an elevation of serum malondialdehyde and nitric oxide. The myotoxic effects of venom, melittin, and phospholipase A2 were demonstrated after injection by s.c. route. No synergistic myotoxicity between melittin and PLA2 was observed. Moreover, these two components, when injected at equivalent concentrations to those present in venom, induced a lower increase in serum CK than venom, suggesting that other components also contribute to its strong systemic toxicity towards skeletal muscle. The model here presented may be useful in preclinical studies to assess therapeutic antivenoms developed to cope with the problem of massive bee attacks. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Africanized; Apis mellifera; Honeybee; Mouse; Toxicity; Venom",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956062150

They commonly encounter insecticides, and the effects of insecticides on honey bees have been frequently noted. It has been suggested that honey bees may be (as a species) uniquely sensitive to insecticides, although no comparative toxicology study has been undertaken to examine this claim. An extensive literature review was conducted, using data in which adult insects were topically treated with insecticides. The goal of this review was to summarize insecticide toxicity data between A. mellifera and other insects to determine the relative sensitivity of honey bees to insecticides. RESULTS: It was found that, in general, honey bees were no more sensitive than other insect species across the 62 insecticides examined. In addition, honey bees were not more sensitive to any of the six classes of insecticides (carbamates, nicotinoids, organochlorines, organophosphates, pyrethroids and miscellaneous) examined. CONCLUSIONS: While honey bees can be sensitive to individual insecticides, they are not a highly sensitive species to insecticides overall, or even to specific classes of insecticides. However, all pesticides should be used in a way that minimizes honey bee exposure, so as to minimize possible declines in the number of bees and/or honey contamination. © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry.","Carbamate; Comparative toxicology; Neonicotinoid; Organophosphate; Pyrethroid",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958488345

The study was carried out in a canola field, in Southern Brazil. The anthesis stages were morphologically characterised and then related to stigma receptivity and pollen grain viability. Similarly, the behaviour of A. mellifera individuals on flowers was followed, considering the number of flowers visited per plant, the amount of time spent on the flowers, touched structures, and collected resources. Floral fidelity was inferred by analysing the pollen load of bees collected on flowers. The bees visited from 1-7 flowers/plant (x = 2.02; sd = 1.16), the time spent on the flowers varied between 1-43 seconds (x = 3.29; sd = 2.36) and, when seeking nectar and pollen, they invariably touched anthers and stigmas. The pollen load presented 100% of B. napus pollen.

More specifically potential sublethal effects on behavioural traits of the honey bee Apis mellifera L. have not been formally assessed despite the importance of honey bees for pollination. The goal of our study was to assess potential effects of CCRI41 cotton pollen on visual and olfactory learning by honey bees. After a 7-day oral chronic exposure to honey mixed with either CCRI41 pollen, imidaclopridtreated conventional pollen (used as positive sublethal control) or conventional pollen (control), learning performance was evaluated by the classical proboscis extension reflex (PER) procedure as well as a T-tube maze test. The latter assay was designed as a new device to assess potential side effects of pesticides on visual associative learning of honey bees. These two procedures were complementary because the former focused on olfactory learning while the latter was involved in visual learning based on visual orientation ability.Oral exposure to CCRI41 pollen did not affect learning capacities of honey bees in both the T-tube maze and PER tests. However, exposure to imidacloprid resulted in reduced visual learning capacities in T-tube maze evaluation and decreased olfactory learning performances measured with PER. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of risks of transgenic CCRI41 cotton crops for honey bees. © The Author(s) 2010.","Cotton; CpTI; Cry1Ac; Imidacloprid; Pollen; Proboscis extension response; Sublethal effect; T-tube maze; Visual learning ability",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952276627

Both are actively taken up by growing oocytes and especially Vg and its receptor are considered as female-specifically expressed. The finding that the fat body of in honey bee (Apis mellifera) drones synthesizes Vg and is present in hemolymph has long been viewed as a curiosity. The recent paradigm change concerning the role played by Vg in honey bee life history, especially social division of labor, has now led us to investigate whether a physiological constellation similar to that seen in female reproduction may also be represented in the male sex. By means of Western blot analysis we could show that both Vg and Lp are present in the reproductive tract of adult drones, including the accessory (mucus) glands, but apparently are not secreted. Furthermore, we analyzed the transcript levels of the genes encoding these proteins (vg and lp), as well as their putative receptors (Amvgr and Amlpr) in fat body and accessory glands. Whereas lp, vg and Amlpr transcript levels decreased with age in both tissues, Amvgr mRNA levels increased with age in fat body. To our knowledge this is the first report that vitellogenin and its receptor are co-expressed in the reproductive system of a male insect. We interpret these findings as a cross-sexual transfer of a social physiological trait, associated with the rewiring of the juvenile hormone/vitellogenin circuitry that occurred in the female sex of honey bees. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Honey bee; Lipophorin; Male accessory gland; Social insect; Vitellogenin",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955771450

The objective of our study was to evaluate the potential side effects of transgenic Cry1Ac ? CpTI pollen from cotton on young adult honey bees A. mellifera L. Two points emphasized the significance of our study: (1) A higher expression level of insecticidal protein Cry1Ac in pollen tissues was detected (when compared with previous reports). In particular, Cry1Ac protein was detected at 300 ± 4.52 ng g -1 [part per billion (ppb)] in pollen collected in July, (2) Effects on chronic mortality and feeding behaviour in honey bees were evaluated using a no-choice dietary feeding protocol with treated pollen, which guarantee the highest exposure level to bees potentially occurring in natural conditions (worst case scenario). Tests were also conducted using imidacloprid-treated pollen at a concentration of 48 ppb as positive control for sublethal effect on feeding behaviour. Our results suggested that Cry1Ac ? CpTI pollen carried no lethal risk for honey bees. However, during a 7-day oral exposure to the various treatments (transgenic, imidacloprid- treated and control), honey bee feeding behaviour was disturbed and bees consumed significantly less CCRI41 cotton pollen than in the control group in which bees were exposed to conventional cotton pollen. It may indicate an antifeedant effect of CCRI41 pollen on honey bees and thus bees may be at risk because of large areas are planted with transgenic Bt cotton in China. This is the first report suggesting a potential sublethal effect of CCRI41 cotton pollen on honey bees.

Then, with the worldwide introduction of the ectoparasite mite Varroa destructor, beekeepers encountered increasing difficulties in maintaining their colonies. Epidemiological surveys and laboratory experiments have demonstrated that the newly acquired virulence of several viruses belonging to the family Dicistroviridae (acute bee paralysis virus, Kashmir bee virus and Israeli acute paralysis virus) in Europe and the USA had been observed in relation with V. destructor acting as a disseminator of these viruses between and within bee colonies and as an activator of virus multiplication in the infected individuals: bee larvae and adults. Equal emphasis is given to deformed wing virus (DWV) belonging to the Iflaviridae. Overt outbreaks of DWV infections have been shown to be linked to the ability of V. destructor to act not only as a mechanical vector of DWV but also as a biological vector. Its replication in mites prior to its vectoring into pupae seemed to be necessary and sufficient for the induction of a overt infection in pupae developing in non-viable bees with deformed wings. DWV in V. destructor infested colonies is now considered as one of the key players of the final collapse. Various approaches for combating bee viral diseases are described: they include selection of tolerant bees, RNA interference and prevention of new pathogen introduction. None of these approaches are expected to lead to enhanced bee-health in the short term. © 2010 INRA, EDP Sciences.","Bee virus; Honey bee; Paralysis; Wing deformity",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955681293

Typically, within honey bees (Apidae: Apis), morphometric analysis has been used to differentiate the groups and species by using multiple body characteristics. However, these procedures are time-consuming for the suitable preparation of the samples and orientating each part into the correct plane for accurate measurement. Here, we were able to discriminate four honey bee species based on their wing venation pattern information only. Geometric morphometric measurements of the right forewing of drones and workers of Apis andreniformis Smith, Apis cerana F., Apis dorsata F., and Apis florea F. were analyzed. The results demonstrated that the patterns of forewing venation of native Thai honey bees between sexes in the same species were more closely related to each other than to honey bees of the same sex in another species. The wing venation pattern carried sufficient information to discriminate 99% of the individuals, and so the geometric morphometric analysis of the wing alone could be used to identify Asian honey bee species in most circumstances. In addition, the sex of the individual did not obstruct identification. Therefore, morphometric analysis of a single wing might be a useful tool for biodiversity studies of bees and other insects or fossil records.

Various pollinator species can be affected by landscape factors and/or act at different spatial scales. We investigated whether different landscape factors at different spatial scales are correlated with pollinator abundances and pollination success. We examined common buckwheat, which is a self-incompatible crop species, pollinated by managed honeybees, native honeybees, and wild non-honeybee insects. To determine the effects of landscape factors at different spatial scales, we sampled flower-visiting insects and recorded seed sets. Results from the sampled flower visitors indicated that the abundances of managed honeybees, native honeybees, and wild non-honeybee insects were significantly related to the distance of managed hives, the area of forest cover within a 3-km radius, and the area of forest and grassland cover within a 100-m radius, respectively. Additionally, the latter two influential factors of the landscape, but not the distance of managed hives, showed significant positive correlations with the seed set. These results suggest that considering landscape factors at different spatial scales associated with the characteristics of managed and wild pollinators would help to ensure crop yields. © 2010 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","Apis cerana; Apis mellifera; Buckwheat; Crop pollination service; Distylous; Fagopyrum esculentum; Landscape; Polygonaceae",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649443067

The data revealed that, 13 genera belonging to nine trees (8 families) and four shrubs (4 families) provided the nesting platform to A. florea. The density, abundance, and frequency of nesting plants varied considerably. While Pongamia pinnata was selected frequently among the trees, Bouganvillea sp. was preferred among the shrubs for nesting. There was a significant variation (X2 = 18.25; P&lt;0.05) among the tree and shrub species selected for nesting by A. florea in different habitats. Further, thin to medium (2-4 inch dia.) sized limbs, often interspersed thickly at different elevations in trees and shrubby plants were found suitable for the construction of colonies. The combs were found at the peripheral and middle regions of thickly interspersed canopy in trees and shrubs respectively, possibly to ensure withstanding the comb weight, protecting the comb from wind blow, and avoiding predation and hunting. Thus, it appears that A. florea adopts elite strategy to safeguard its colonies from certain ecological and biological impediments in the wild by choosing plants with thick interspersed limbs covered with thick canopy. In view of its role as an important pollinating agent of many crops, the preservation of the commonly chosen nesting plants becomes all the more important for conservation of A. florea. © 2010 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","A. florea; India; nesting trees; tropical conditions",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649363856

Bumblebee individuals were grouped into the following functional groups, based on castes and tongue length: (1) all queens, (2) all workers, (3) short-tongued workers and (4) long-tongued workers. In 14 study fields, no spatial or diurnal within-field differences were found in abundances of bee groups. However, seasonal differences were detected. On average 6.3 ± 0.6Bombus spp. were observed in each field. In general, maximum observed bee abundances of a field were not associated with field size, weediness, or presence of commercial honeybee hives. However, long-tongued bumblebee abundance was significantly lower in fields with beehives. Seed yield was marginally higher in less weedy fields, but not significantly augmented by presence of bee hives. © 2010 INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences.","Apis mellifera; Bestäubung von Kulturpflanzen; Kurz- und langrüsselige Hummeln; Trifolium pratense",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958520235

(Hymenoptera: Apidae), is invested in cords of muscles that are numerous enough, in both latitudinal and longitudinal directions, to fully enclose and confine the underlying, cuticle-lined epithelium. Although appressed against the inner wall of this enclosure by the crop's contents, the epithelium is largely free of ligations that would immobilize it. It can therefore slide on the inner wall and undergo extensive pleating as needed to conform to the diameter of the enclosure, regardless of the extent of contraction or distention. The two primary components of the epithelial layer, epidermal cells and procuticle, can undergo extreme compression to maintain pleats while enduring the pressure exerted by the volume of crop contents. During engorgement with nectar, the muscular enclosure relaxes to larger and larger diameters. Correspondingly, pleats unfold as needed. During dispensation of nectar in the hive, the muscular enclosure contracts and forces the epithelium to pleat itself again. Pleats are present in even the most grossly distended crops, indicating that capacity is not a limiting factor in the volume of nectar a bee can accumulate during foraging. Individual pleats are appressed, too, indicating that a lubricating, cohering substance occurs between them. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.","Apis mellifera; crop; cuticle; honey bee; honey stomach",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649272665

In this study, we focused on a major gap in the understanding of this striking behaviour: the question of the sensory modality by which meaningful information is transferred from dancers to followers. We revisited the hypothesis that tactile stimuli convey information about the direction relative to gravity and the length of the waggle phase. It has long been suggested that followers use tactile stimuli arising from the wagging movements of a dancing bee to decode information in the dance. Yet, the questions of whether and to what extent such movements are mapped to the tactile experience of the followers have never been resolved. Using high-speed video techniques, we found that the higher the number of the dancer's wagging movements, the higher the number of the followers' antennal deflections. We also documented that most followers faced the dancers laterally and experienced a fairly regular pattern of tactile stimuli; a much smaller proportion of followers faced the dancers from behind and became the subject of a different, although still regular, pattern of tactile stimuli. From these observations, we conclude that tactile mechanosensory input from the antennae, presumably processed by neurons of the antennal joint hair sensilla and the neck hair plates, enables bees to estimate both the direction relative to gravity and the length of the waggle phase. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Apis mellifera; Dance communication; Honeybee; Mechanosensory input; Tactile stimulus; Waggle dance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957770749

To determine if these very different diet-controlled phenotypes correlate with unique brain methylomes, we conducted a study to determine the methyl cytosine (mC) distribution in the brains of queens and workers at single-base-pair resolution using shotgun bisulfite sequencing technology. The whole-genome sequencing was validated by deep 454 sequencing of selected amplicons representing eight methylated genes. We found that nearly all mCs are located in CpG dinucleotides in the exons of 5,854 genes showing greater sequence conservation than non-methylated genes. Over 550 genes show significant methylation differences between queens and workers, revealing the intricate dynamics of methylation patterns. The distinctiveness of the differentially methylated genes is underscored by their intermediate CpG densities relative to drastically CpG-depleted methylated genes and to CpG-richer non-methylated genes. We find a strong correlation between methylation patterns and splicing sites including those that have the potential to generate alternative exons. We validate our genome-wide analyses by a detailed examination of two transcript variants encoded by one of the differentially methylated genes. The link between methylation and splicing is further supported by the differential methylation of genes belonging to the histone gene family. We propose that modulation of alternative splicing is one mechanism by which DNA methylation could be linked to gene regulation in the honey bee. Our study describes a level of molecular diversity previously unknown in honey bees that might be important for generating phenotypic flexibility not only during development but also in the adult post-mitotic brain. © 2010 Lyko et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649955848

Methods: Honey samples were collected from Apis mellifera colonies forged on 10 floras to analyze the quality of honey in terms of standards laid by Honey Grading and Marking Rules (HGMR), India, 2008 and Codex Alimentarious Commission (CAC), 1969. The honey samples were analyzed for various physicochemical parameters of honey quality control, i.e., pH, total acidity, moisture, reducing sugars, non-reducing sugars, total sugars, water insoluble solids (WIS), ash content, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural content, and diastase value. The antioxidant potential was estimated using FolinCiocalteu reagent. Further, honey samples were assayed for antibacterial activities against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli using the hole-plate diffusion method. Results: The physicochemical variation in the composition of honey because of floral source shows Ziziphus honey with high pH and diastase values along with low acidity, whereas Helianthus honey contained high reducing sugar and low moisture content. Amomum, Brassica, Acacia, and Citrus contained lowest amount of non-reducing sugars, ash, WIS, and moisture, respectively. Lowest 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) value was detected in Amomum honey, while highest HMF value was observed with Eucalyptus. The maximum antibacterial and antioxidant potential was observed in Azadirachta and Citrus, respectively. Conclusion: The quality of honey produced by local beekeepers met HGMR and CAC standards, and the chemical composition and biological properties of honey were dependent on the floral source from which it was produced. © 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.","Acacia spp.; Antibacterial; Antioxidant; Apis mellifera; Citrus spp.; Eucalyptus spp.; Honey; Physicochemical parameters; Ziziphus spp.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649498804

During development, S. exigua expressed SeCu/ZnSOD predominantly at embryonic stage, pupal stage and adult female stage, whereas it was slightly expressed in larvae and adult male. In addition, SeCu/ZnSOD was highly expressed in the fat body, hemocyte, silk gland and Malpighian tubule, although the levels of SeCu/ZnSOD transcripts were very low in the gut. Furthermore, SeCu/ZnSOD mRNA was slightly induced in response to either lipopolysaccharide or laminarin. Finally, SeCu/ZnSOD mRNA was induced in carcass in response to S. exigua nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeNPV) infection, whereas it was not strikingly induced in the gut.

To date, the fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster and Bactrocera oleae, mosquitoes of the genera Anopheles and Aedes, the honey bee Apis mellifera, the leafhopper Scaphoideus titanus, and the mealybug Saccharicoccus sacchari have been found to be associated with the bacterial genera Acetobacter, Gluconacetobacter, Gluconobacter, Asaia, and Saccharibacter and the novel genus Commensalibacter. AAB establish symbiotic associations with the insect midgut, a niche characterized by the availability of diet-derived carbohydrates and oxygen and by an acidic pH, selective factors that support AAB growth. AAB have been shown to actively colonize different insect tissues and organs, such as the epithelia of male and female reproductive organs, the Malpighian tubules, and the salivary glands. This complex topology of the symbiosis indicates that AAB possess the keys for passing through body barriers, allowing them to migrate to different organs of the host. Recently, AAB involvement in the regulation of innate immune system homeostasis of Drosophila has been shown, indicating a functional role in host survival. All of these lines of evidence indicate that AAB can play different roles in insect biology, not being restricted to the feeding habit of the host. The close association of AAB and their insect hosts has been confirmed by the demonstration of multiple modes of transmission between individuals and to their progeny that include vertical and horizontal transmission routes, comprising a venereal one. Taken together, the data indicate that AAB represent novel secondary symbionts of insects. Copyright © 2010, American Society for Microbiology.",,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149434620

We found three viruses, Deformed Wing Virus (DWV), Acute Bee Paralysis Virus (ABPV) and Kashmir Bee Virus (KBV) in all surveyed states. Chronic Bee Paralysis Virus (CBPV) and Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) were found in both California and Florida, but not in Hawaii. Slow Paralysis Virus (SPV) was not found in any samples. While N. ceranae was ubiquitous in all samples, N. apis was notably absent, none being detected in any samples. Tracheal mites and Tropilaelaps mites were also not found in any samples. Varroa mites were found in all states, and were found particularly abundantly in some Hawaii samples. This survey was not designed to be comprehensive representation of the country, and the results should not be interpreted to mean the absence of certain pathogens in the US or in any one particular state.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78349231277

These are based on a stepwise approach, starting with simple calculations based on existing data in dossiers and progressing to higher-tier semi-field and field studies (the guidelines for these have been modified in line with this). The proposed scheme has been tested with data packages of high- and low-risk PPPs. A future area of interest for the group may be the risks posed by guttation fluid containing systemic pesticides. A recent paper on 'Translocation of neonicotinoid insecticides from coated seeds to seedling guttation drops: a novel way of intoxication for bees' has focused significant interest on the possible risks posed by the presence of residues of systemic pesticides in guttation fluid to water-collecting honey bees.

Here, we report on the selective isolation of actinomycetes from the gut microbiota of healthy honeybees, and their inhibitory activity against honeybee indigenous bacteria. More than 70% of the sampled honeybees (N>40) in a season carried at least one CFU of actinomycete. The isolates from bees of one location produced inhibitory bioactivities that were almost exclusively against several bee indigenous Bacillus strains and Gram-positive human pathogens but not Escherichia coli. An antibiotic-producing actinomycete closely related to Nocardiopsis alba was isolated from the guts in every season of the year. A DNA fragment encoding a homologous gene (phzD) involved in phenazine biosynthesis was identified in the isolate. Expression of the phzD detected by reverse transcription-PCR can explain the survival of this organism in anaerobic environments as some redox-active extracellular phenazines are commonly regarded as respiratory electron acceptors.

Owing to the extreme instability of amitraz, this analyte was transformed into the stable end-metabolite 2,4-dimethylaniline, later derivatised with heptafluorobutyric anhydride and determined by GC-μECD/MS. Recoveries from spiked samples ranged from 86 to 108%, while quantification limits varied from 0.10 to 0.30 mg kg-1 using GC-μECD/NPD, and from 12 to 85 μg kg-1 by GC-MSD. Of a total of 197 samples analysed, only eight samples (4%) were free of residues of chlorfenvinphos (0.019-10.6 mg kg-1), fluvalinate was present in 93.6% of samples analysed (0.027 -88.7 mg kg-1), while coumaphos was confirmed in only five of the 134 samples analysed at concentrations of less than 195 μg kg-1. The remaining acaricides were identified with different levels of incidence at concentrations from 12 to 231 μg kg-1.CONCLUSIONS: Residues of acaricides were found in an extensive number of beeswax samples. The contamination with chlorfenvinphos and tau-fluvalinate was very relevant, particularly as chlorfenvinphos is not legally authorised for use in beekeeping. The possible impacts of the main acaricides detected on larval and adult honey bees are discussed. © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry.","Acaricides; Beeswax; Gas chromatography; Residues; Varroa",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958482226

Hence, 3 experimental treatment groups (control, 0.5 mg/L of BV, and 1 mg/L of BV) were allocated to 3 replicates of 5,000 one-day-old chicks each. The control group was kept on tap water, whereas the other 2 groups were supplied water supplemented with 0.5 and 1 mg of BV, respectively, per liter of drinking water. Broilers were provided ad libitum access to feed for the experimental period of 1 to 28 d of age. Supplementing drinking water with BV significantly increased BW gain at 28 d of age (P < 0.05). The average daily weight gain from d 1 to 28 was increased for birds supplemented with BV compared with control birds. The increase in BW gain was more pronounced with supplementation of 1 mg/L of BV compared with 0.5 mg/L of BV. An improved feed intake was noted in groups supplemented with BV as compared with control chicks. Liver function enzymes, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase activities including total cholesterol, total protein, albumin, and globulin were not changed by BV supplementation. Tap water supplementation of BV did not alter the number of leukocytes, erythrocytes, heterophils, and lymphocytes. However, the antioxidative activities estimated as a superoxide dismutase-like activity of broiler chicks supplemented with BV was significantly increased (P < 0.05) in comparison with those without BV supplementation.

In some, of which social insects are the best example, it is suggested that females benefit from the increased genetic diversity of their offspring. Social insect colonies express division of labor, and if genotypes behave differently (genetic polyethism), then genetically diverse colonies may be fitter. However, unequivocal evidence of genetic polyethism is only known from honey bees. Here, we show that such a genetic influence on behavior is also present in the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex echinatior. In 2 of the 3 colonies examined, we found that the offspring of some fathers (patrilines) were more likely to engage in waste management, whereas other patrilines were more likely to engage in foraging. When we increased the stimulus for waste management, the representation of patrilines in the ants that responded was the same as normally engaged in waste management in 2 colonies but differed in the third colony. The leaf-cutting ant A. echinatior therefore shows genetic polyethism. Although other factors such as disease resistance may have also played a role in the evolution of polyandry, the results suggest that genetic polyethism may be widespread in social insects and potentially of general importance in the evolution of polyandry. © The Author 2010.

This calculation linked longevity to aerobic metabolism which in turn led to the ""rate-of-living"" and ultimately the ""oxidative stress"" theories of aging. However, the link between metabolic rate and longevity is imperfect. Although unknown in Rubner's time, one aspect of body composition of mammals also varies with body size, namely the fatty acid composition of membranes. Fatty acids vary dramatically in their susceptibility to peroxidation and the products of lipid peroxidation are very powerful reactive molecules that damage other cellular molecules. The ""membrane pacemaker"" modification of the ""oxidative stress"" theory of aging proposes that fatty acid composition of membranes, via its influence on peroxidation of lipids, is an important determinant of lifespan (and a link between metabolism and longevity). The relationship between membrane fatty acid composition and longevity is discussed for (1) mammals of different body size, (2) birds of different body size, (3) mammals and birds that are exceptionally long-living for their size, (4) strains of mice that vary in longevity, (5) calorie-restriction extension of longevity in rodents, (6) differences in longevity between queen and worker honeybees, and (7) variation in longevity among humans. Most of these comparisons support an important role for membrane fatty acid composition in the determination of longevity. It is apparent that membrane composition is regulated for each species. Provided the diet is not deficient in polyunsaturated fat, it has minimal influence on a species' membrane fatty acid composition and likely also on it's maximum longevity. The exceptional longevity of Homo sapiens combined with the limited knowledge of the fatty acid composition of human tissues support the potential importance of mitochondrial membranes in determination of longevity. © The Author 2010.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651491365

Honeybee foragers with their high metabolic demand due to flight are especially prone to such a stress when they are infected. We hypothesized that infection by the microsporidian gut parasite Nosema ceranae can lower the hemolymph sugar level of an individual forager and uncouple its energetic state from its normally tight correlation with the colony energetic state. We support our hypothesis by showing that free-flying foragers that are infected have lower trehalose levels than uninfected ones but the two do not differ in their trehalose levels when fed until satiation. The trehalose level of infected bees was also found to decline at a faster rate while their glucose level is maintained at a quantity comparable to uninfected bees. These results suggest that infected foragers have lower flying ability and the intriguing possibility that the carbohydrate levels of an individual bee can act as a modulator of its foraging behavior, independent of social cues such as colony demand for nectar. We discuss the importance of such pathophysiological changes on foraging behavior in the context of the recently observed colony collapses. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Energetic stress; Foraging; Honeybee; Metabolism; Nosema ceranae",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955773926

Task partitioning, breaking a task into subtasks performed by different individuals, is a key adaptation requiring group-level coordination of action. This study explores the communication processes that underlie task partitioning, focusing on the contrasting roles played by signals and cues. A fundamental problem of task partitioning is maintaining equal work outputs between the groups involved. Honey bees clearly use 2 mechanisms, and possibly a third, to achieve this goal. First, colonies make preemptive changes to their labor allocation by sending signals that are predictive of future work needs. Second, colonies are able to take measures to recalibrate the number of workers assigned to groups after unpredictable changes in work demand. Finally, colonies may be able to fine-tune the number of workers in task groups by modulating the activity rate of workers in time with changes in work demand. Based on this review of task partitioning, it is argued that signals are preferable to cues in some instances because they can be actively targeted to their recipients, as opposed to cues, which are passive sources of information. Furthermore, a recipient's behavioral state (active or inactive) does not affect their ability to receive signals, whereas it can for many cues. The results of this study should be broadly applicable, as wasp, bee, ant, and termite societies face similar problems and because data suggest that other social insects use similar communication mechanisms to bees. © The Author 2010.

The vulnerability of native biotas to ecological disruption may be especially great on oceanic islands invaded by continental species with unique ecological traits. In part because Hawaii lacks native eusocial insects, social invaders may threaten endemic taxa that are ecologically similar but solitary. Using a combination of field manipulations, molecular analyses, physiological data, and behavioral assays, we identify the mechanisms underlying the displacement of two genera of native solitary Hymenoptera in Hawaii by a social continental invader, the western yellowjacket (Vespula pensylvanica). Experimental removal of V. pensylvanica colonies resulted in increased densities of native Hymenoptera. Endemic Hylaeus bees directly suffer through predation by yellowjackets, and perhaps as a consequence, avoid floral resources occupied by V. pensylvanica. Native Nesodynerus wasps also avoid V. pensylvanica but are negatively affected by yellowjackets not through predation, but through exploitative competition for caterpillar prey. Displacement of native solitary Hymenoptera may be heightened by the ability of V. pensylvanica to prey upon and scavenge honey bees and to rob their honey stores, resources unavailable to endemic bees and wasps because of their specialized niches. Our study provides a unique example of an ecologically generalized social invader that restructures native assemblages of solitary Hymenoptera by interacting with endemic taxa on multiple trophic levels. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Exploitative competition; Hawaii; Hylaeus; Invasions; Nesodynerus; Predation; Vespula pensylvanica; Yellowjacket",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78249255534

Mainalo), Greece. A preliminary study was carried out to investigate these unexplained phenomena in this region. In total, 37 bee samples, two brood frames containing honey bee brood of various ages, eight sugar samples and four sugar patties were collected from the affected colonies. The samples were tested for a range of pests, pathogens and pesticides. Symptomatic adult honey bees tested positive for Varroa destructor, Nosema ceranae, Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV), Acute paralysis virus (ABPV), Deformed wing virus (DWV), Sacbrood virus (SBV) and Black queen cell virus (BQCV), but negative for Acarapis woodi. American Foulbrood was absent from the brood samples. Chemical analysis revealed that amitraz, thiametoxan, clothianidin and acetamiprid were all absent from symptomatic adult bees, sugar and sugar patty samples. However, some bee samples, were contaminated with imidacloprid in concentrations between 14 ng/g and 39 ng/g tissue. We present: the infection of Greek honey bees by multiple viruses; the presence of N. ceranae in Greek honey bees and the first record of imidacloprid (neonicotonoid) residues in Greek honey bee tissues. The presence of multiple pathogens and pesticides made it difficult to associate a single specific cause to the depopulation phenomena observed in Greece, although we believe that viruses and N. ceranae synergistically played the most important role. A follow up in-depth survey across all Greek regions is required to provide context to these preliminary findings. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Colony depopulation; Honey bee; Imidacloprid; Nosema ceranae; Virus",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958176954

Comparative genomic analyses can help elucidate the function of DNA methylation by identifying conserved features of methylated genes and other genomic regions. In this study, we used computational approaches to distinguish genes marked by heavy methylation from those marked by little or no methylation in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. We investigated if these two classes had distinct evolutionary histories and functional roles by conducting comparative analysis with the honeybee, Apis (Ap.) mellifera. We found that highly methylated orthologs in A. pisum and Ap. mellifera exhibited greater conservation of methylation status, suggesting that highly methylated genes in ancestral species may remain highly methylated over time. We also found that methylated genes tended to show different rates of evolution than unmethylated genes. In addition, genes targeted by methylation were enriched for particular biological processes that differed from those in relatively unmethylated genes. Finally, methylated genes were preferentially ubiquitously expressed among alternate phenotypes in both species, whereas genes lacking signatures of methylation were preferentially associated with condition-specific gene expression. Overall, our analyses support a conserved role for DNA methylation in insects with comparable methylation systems. © The Author(s) 2010.","Comparative genomics; DNA methylation; Epigenetics; Insects; Phenotypic plasticity; Polyphenism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958479693

Also the role of style movements in pollination of Nigella flowers was evaluated. The results indicate that Nigella sativa is completely self compatible; the main visitors were honeybees and the flowers were unattractive to other wild bees under study conditions. The results also show that Nigella sativa is not fully pollinated in the absence of insect pollinators; wind plays little or no role in its pollination processes. The mechanism of style movement and its role in flower pollination are discussed.

Here we present an initial survey of the V. destructor genome carried out to advance our understanding of Varroa biology and to identify new avenues for mite control. This sequence survey provides immediate resources for molecular and population-genetic analyses of Varroa-Apis interactions and defines the challenges ahead for a comprehensive Varroa genome project.Results: The genome size was estimated by flow cytometry to be 565 Mbp, larger than most sequenced insects but modest relative to some other Acari. Genomic DNA pooled from ~1,000 mites was sequenced to 4.3× coverage with 454 pyrosequencing. The 2.4 Gbp of sequencing reads were assembled into 184,094 contigs with an N50 of 2,262 bp, totaling 294 Mbp of sequence after filtering. Genic sequences with homology to other eukaryotic genomes were identified on 13,031 of these contigs, totaling 31.3 Mbp. Alignment of protein sequence blocks conserved among V. destructor and four other arthropod genomes indicated a higher level of sequence divergence within this mite lineage relative to the tick Ixodes scapularis. A number of microbes potentially associated with V. destructor were identified in the sequence survey, including ~300 Kbp of sequence deriving from one or more bacterial species of the Actinomycetales. The presence of this bacterium was confirmed in individual mites by PCR assay, but varied significantly by age and sex of mites. Fragments of a novel virus related to the Baculoviridae were also identified in the survey. The rate of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the pooled mites was estimated to be 6.2 × 10-5per bp, a low rate consistent with the historical demography and life history of the species.Conclusions: This survey has provided general tools for the research community and novel directions for investigating the biology and control of Varroa mites. Ongoing development of Varroa genomic resources will be a boon for comparative genomics of under-represented arthropods, and will further enhance the honey bee and its associated pathogens as a model system for studying host-pathogen interactions. © 2010 Cornman et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958129830

Lack of progress is primarily a result of the complex social and genetic architecture of honey-bee colonies, which makes selection of genetically superior individuals difficult. Colonies comprise four levels of genetic architecture: genes, individuals, patrilines and the colony. Interactions within and between each of the levels influence the colony-level phenotype. Genetic progress is further hindered by the honey bee's reproductive biology, which hinders control of mating, and the severe effects of inbreeding, a consequence of the mechanism of sex determination.Recent advances in the genetic resources available for honey bees have started to reveal the genetic relationships between traits of economic importance. Genetic markers for commercially important traits are being identified, which should allow for marker assisted selection. Improved statistical models are now able to simultaneously account for both queen and worker influences on colony-level phenotype across multiple genetically correlated traits, thereby increasing the accuracy of selection and the potential rate of genetic improvement.We conclude our review by describing two exemplar breeding schemes that have incorporated some of the breeding technologies discussed, and which have also been successfully maintained for an extended period of time. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Apis mellifera; Inbreeding; Marker Assisted Selection; Quantitative Trait Locus; Social Architecture",Book,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957964495

The acquisition of microsatellites through multiplex-enriched libraries and 454 GS-FLX Titanium pyrosequencing is a promising new tool for the isolation of new markers in unknown genomes. This approach can also be used to evaluate the extent to which microsatellite-enriched libraries are representative of the genome from which they were isolated. In this study, we deciphered potential discrepancies in microsatellite content recovery for two reference genomes (Apis mellifera and Danio rerio), selected on the basis of their extreme heterogeneity in terms of the proportions and distributions of microsatellites on chromosomes.Results: The A. mellifera genome, in particular, was found to be highly heterogeneous, due to extremely high rates of recombination, with hotspots, but the only bias consistently introduced into pyrosequenced multiplex-enriched libraries concerned sequence length, with the overrepresentation of sequences 160 to 320 bp in length. Other deviations from expected proportions or distributions of motifs on chromosomes were observed, but the significance and intensity of these deviations was mostly limited. Furthermore, no consistent adverse competition between multiplexed probes was observed during the motif enrichment phase.Conclusions: This approach therefore appears to be a promising strategy for improving the development of microsatellites, as it introduces no major bias in terms of the proportions and distribution of microsatellites. © 2010 Martin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957748140

In the first experiment DEET and butyric acid readily led to standard acquisition and extinction effects, which are comparable to the use of cinnamon as a conditioned stimulus. These results demonstrate that the odor of DEET or butyric acid is not intrinsically repellent to honey bees. In a second experiment, with DEET and butyric acid mixed with sucrose as an unconditioned stimulus, proboscis conditioning was not established. After several trials, few animals responded to the unconditioned stimulus. These results demonstrate that these chemicals are gustatory repellents when in direct contact. In the last experiment a conditioned suppression paradigm was used. Exposing animals to butyric acid or DEET when the proboscis was extended by direct sucrose stimulation or by learning revealed that retraction of the proboscis was similar to another novel odor, lavender, and in all cases greatest when the animal was not permitted to feed.

In the spring, gynes of each species were caught in the wild and introduced to nest boxes in one of three ways. Gynes were either introduced in conspecific pairs, singly with two honey bees, Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) workers, or alone. Nesting success and colony growth parameters were measured to understand the effects of the various treatments on nest establishment. Colonies initiated from pairs of conspecific gynes were most successful in producing worker bees (59.1%), less successful were colonies initiated with honey bee workers (33.3%), and least successful were bumble bee gynes initiating colonies alone (16.7%). There was a negative correlation between the numbers of days to the emergence of the first worker in a colony to the attainment of ultimate colony size, indicating that gynes that have not commenced oviposition in 21 days are unlikely to result in colonies exceeding 50 workers. B. appositus had the highest rate of nest establishment followed by B. bifarius and B. centralis. Nest establishment rates in three western bumble bee species can be increased dramatically by the addition of either honey bee workers or a second gyne to nesting boxes at colony initiation.","bumble bees; colony parameters; nest initiation; nesting success",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957579290

Three spiroplasma isolates were obtained from healthy Apis mellifera. All isolates exhibited helicity during their growth phase, with one isolate (MF0905) being shorter and having less helicity. This isolate also differed from the other two (MF0903 and MF0904) in having larger colonies with an irregular margin instead of being round. In addition, isolate MF0905 could not hydrolyze arginine whereas MF0903 and MF0904 could. All three isolates could use glucose and D-fructose as a carbon source but did not hydrolyse urea. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rDNA, ITS and the rpoB gene showed that MF0903 and MF0904 had a close relationship with Spiroplasma melliferum, and MF0905 was close to S. clarkii. Serological studies including the growth inhibition test, metabolic inhibition test and deformation test gave the same result as the phylogenetic analysis.

A rapid DNA extraction method combined with multiplex PCR to amplify the 16S rRNA gene with species-specific primers was compared with a previously published assay requiring spore-germination buffer and a DNA extraction kit. When the spore germination-extraction kit method was used, 10 or more bees were required to detect the pathogens, whereas the new extraction method made it possible to detect the pathogens in single bees. Approx. 4-8 times better detection of N. ceranae was found with the new method compared to the spore germination-extraction kit method. In addition, the time and cost required to process samples was lower with the proposed method compared to using a kit. Using the new DNA extraction method, a spore quantification procedure was developed using a triplex PCR involving co-amplifying the N. apis and N. ceranae 16S rRNA gene with the ribosomal protein gene, RpS5, from the honey bee. The accuracy of this semi-quantitative PCR was determined by comparing the relative band intensities to the number of spores per bee determined by microscopy for 23 samples, and a high correlation (R2=0.95) was observed. This method of Nosema spore quantification revealed that spore numbers as low as 100 spores/bee could be detected by PCR. The new semi-quantitative triplex PCR assay is more sensitive, economical, rapid, simple, and reliable than previously published standard PCR-based methods for detection of Nosema and will be useful in laboratories where real-time PCR is not available. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Identification; Infection levels; Nosema apis; Nosema ceranae; PCR; Spore",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956187626

A large-scale field experiment was conducted to monitor a husbandry-based method, using comb replacement (known as Shook swarm), as a drug free EFB control option. The understanding of EFB epidemiology is limited, with little information on the presence of Melissococcus plutonius in disease free colonies. Additional samples were collected from diseased and disease free apiaries to identify symptomless infection. EFB reoccurrence was not significantly different between OTC and husbandry methods and real-time PCR data demonstrated that fewer Shook swarm treated colonies contained M. plutonius carryover to the Spring following treatment. Asymptomatic colonies from diseased apiaries showed an increased risk of testing positive for M. plutonius compared to asymptomatic colonies from disease free apiaries. The probability of a sample being symptomatic increased when a greater quantity of M. plutonius was detected in adult bees and larvae. The possibility of treating EFB as an apiary disease rather than a colony disease and the implications of a control strategy without antibiotics are discussed. © 2010.","Detection; Disease control; Epidemiology; Honey bee; Oxytetracycline; QPCR; Treatment",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956183147

Its role as a vector of diseases is thought to involve the salivary glands as the terminal organs of transmission. The salivary glands are paired, oval, non-acinar organs, closely attached to the base of the gnathosoma and enveloped in a sheath of unknown embryological origin. Ultrastructurally, they are characterized by the surrounding sheath, and cells that have a strong presence of rough endoplasmic reticulum, irregular-shaped nuclei, and secretory spheres surrounded by an otherwise electron-lucent cytosol. Secretory spheres are sparse in most peripheral cells and heavily converged about the apical membranes of interior cells. Interior cells are positioned radially about the internal duct cells. The internal ducal lumen is narrow and brush-bordered. The membranes between the ducal lumen and the gland cell cytoplasm are fused and ruptured, allowing the salivary spheres to pass into the interior duct for secretion through the exterior duct. Bacterial biofilms are associated with the spheres and the rupture. Virus particles and endosymbionts are also present in the glands. The external duct remains uncharacterized, but the assumption that its embryonic origin is the same as that of the internal duct and surrounding gland cells is questioned. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","bee mite; biofilms; disease transmission; honey bee; parasite; salivary glands; Varroa; varroatosis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149278444

Antibiotics are used in many countries for the control of AFB in high incidence areas, but their misuse may lead to antibiotic resistance of bacterial strains and honey contamination. The objective of the present work was to determine, through a biological method, the protein binding of tylosin, tilmicosin and oxytetracycline to worker jelly; honey; pollen; adult bees and larvae in order to propose their kinetic routes. The sensitivity limit of the technique used was 0.05 μg/ml for tylosin and tilmicosin and 0.01 μg/ml for oxytetracycline, respectively. The method had intra and inter-assay correlation coefficients over 0.90, respectively and a coefficient variation of intra-and inter-assay for all antibiotics and processed samples under 5%. Tylosin and oxytetracycline presented lower percentages of protein binding in tissues and hive products (average 15%) in relation to those observed for tilmicosin (29%). In conclusion, tylosin is useful for AFB control in honey bee colonies due to its chemical characteristics, antimicrobial activity and levels of protein binding in bees, larvae, and beehive products.","Bees; Biological method; Honey; Larvae; Protein binding; Worker jelly",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651391325

The dwarf honey bee Apis florea L. was the most abundant flower visitor, and comprised more than 94% of the total visitors. Commencement of flight activity occurred when a minimum threshold of environmental variables was exceeded, while the cessation was governed mainly by decline in light intensity and radiation. The foraging population correlated significantly and positively with air temperature, light intensity, solar radiation and nectar-sugar concentration and negatively with relative humidity. Path coefficient analysis, revealed, however, that the direct effect of temperature was large and positive followed by light intensity and solar radiation while the direct effect of relative humidity was small and negative. The direct effect of nectar-sugar concentration was positive and negligible. Path coefficient analysis thus gave a clearer picture of the effects than did a simple correlation analysis.

Seed set is often pollen-limited, but species with late-acting self-incompatibility (SI) may be particularly vulnerable, if self-pollen deposition results in ovule discounting. Pollination is examined and the occurrence of late-acting SI and ovule discounting assessed in Cyrtanthus breviflorus. Methods: The pollination system was characterized by observing floral visitors and assessing nectar production and spectral reflectance of flowers. To assess late-acting SI and ovule discounting, growth of self- and cross-pollen tubes, and seed set following open pollination or hand pollination with varying proportions of self- and cross-pollen, were examined. Key Results: Native honeybees Apis mellifera scutellata pollinated flowers as they actively collected pollen. Most flowers (≥70 ) did not contain nectar, while the rest produced minute volumes of dilute nectar. The flowers which are yellow to humans are visually conspicuous to bees with a strong contrast between UV-reflecting tepals and UV-absorbing anthers and pollen. Plants were self-incompatible, but self-rejection was late-acting and both self- and cross-pollen tubes penetrated ovules. Seed set of open-pollinated flowers was pollen-limited, despite pollen deposition exceeding ovule number by 6-fold. Open-pollinated seed set was similar to that of the cross + self-pollen treatment, but was less than that of the cross-pollen-only treatment. Conclusions: Flowers of C. breviflorus are pollinated primarily by pollen-collecting bees and possess a late-acting SI system, previously unknown in this clade of the Amaryllidaceae. Pollinators of C. breviflorus deposit mixtures of cross- and self-pollen and, because SI is late-acting, self-pollen disables ovules, reducing female fertility. This study thus contributes to growing evidence that seed production in plants with late-acting SI systems is frequently limited by pollen quality, even when pollinators are abundant. © The Author 2010.

Using newly emerged caged worker honeybees (Apis mellifera scutellata), we investigated whether bees maintain their intake target when confined to pairs of imbalanced complementary diets varying in protein to carbohydrate (P:C) ratio. Diets were formulated using three protein sources [casein, royal jelly or Feed-Bee ® (a natural pollen substitute)] and sucrose. Within each protein type, honeybees switched between complementary diets and converged on the same P:C intake target. However, this target differed between protein types: P:C ratios were 1:12, 1:14 and 1:11 on casein, royal jelly and Feed-Bee ® diets, respectively. Except for an early peak in protein consumption on royal jelly diets, these strongly convergent ratios remained constant over the 14 day experiment. This is probably due to the absence of brood, reflected in relatively stable values measured for haemolymph protein concentration and hypopharyngeal gland activation in bees on Feed-Bee ® diets. Performance of caged workers was also assessed in terms of survival and ovarian activation. Survival was highest on casein diets and lowest on Feed-Bee ® diets but ovarian activation was highest on royal jelly diets and lowest on casein diets. This may be due to additional components in Feed-Bee ® and royal jelly (e.g. fatty acids), which are needed to activate the ovaries but also reduce survival. Nutrient intake of broodless workers is directly related to their own physiological requirements, and the strong carbohydrate bias may reflect the high metabolic rate of honeybees even under resting conditions. © 2010.

This raises the question of the risk of dissemination of genetically modified (GM) pollen to non-GM crops by visiting insects. We inventoried the flower-visiting insects in Bt and non-Bt cotton fields of the South African Highveld region and investigated their role in pollen dispersal. Their diversity and abundance varied slightly among sites, with Astylus atromaculatus as the predominant insect on both Bt and non-Bt cotton flowers. The other major flower-visiting species were Apis mellifera and solitary Apidae. No differences were found in the abundance of each taxum between Bt and non-Bt cotton except for Scoliidae and Nitidulidae, which were scarce overall (<0.5%) but more abundant on the non-Bt flowers in the central area of the field at one site. The pollen load on A. atromaculatus was as high as on Apis mellifera. Cage tests showed that A. atromaculatus can pollinate female cotton plants by transferring pollen from male donor plants. In the field, the flight range of this insect was generally short (25 m), but it can occasionally reach up to 200 m or even more. This study therefore highlights that A. atromaculatus, commonly regarded as a pest, could be an unexpected but efficient pollinator. Because its population density can be high, this species could mediate unwanted cotton pollen flow when distances between coexiting fields are not sufficient. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.","Apis mellifera; Astylus atromaculatus; Bt cotton; gene flow; insect population",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957792675

It is highly unlikely that he made this comment, which was even mentioned in a Lancet article on honey bees. However, the current vanishing of the bees can have serious consequences for human health, because 35% of the human diet is thought to benefit from pollination. Colony collapse disorder (CCD) in honey bees is characterized by the rapid decline of the adult bee population, leaving the brood and the queen poorly or completely unattended, with no dead bodies in or around the hive. A large study found no evidence that the presence or amount of any individual pesticide or infectious agent occurred more frequently or abundantly in CCD-affected colonies. The growing consensus is that honey bees are suffering from comprised immune systems, which allow various infectious pathogens to invade. The question remains, what causes immunosuppression in many colonies of Apis mellifera in North America and Europe? Telomeres are protective DNA structures located at eukaryotic chromosome tips that shorten in the somatic tissues of animals with age. Lifelong tissue regeneration takes place in Apis mellifera, and worker bees have been shown to senesce. In humans, a vast amount of literature has accumulated on exhausted telomere reserves causing impaired tissue regeneration and age-associated diseases, specifically cancer and immunosuppression. Therefore, we propose a new causative mechanism for the vanishing of the bees: critically short telomeres in long-lived winter bees. We term this the telomere premature aging syndrome. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955567110

Annotation of detoxification [cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), esterase (Est) and ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC transporter)] genes revealed that they are dramatically reduced in P. h. humanus compared to other insects except for Apis mellifera.

Using a bioinformatics approach, we screened the recently sequenced genome of the parasitic wasp, Nasonia vitripennis, for the presence of these signaling molecules and annotated 30 precursor genes encoding 51 different mature neuropeptides or protein hormones. Twenty-four of the predicted mature Nasonia neuropeptides could be experimentally confirmed by mass spectrometry. We also discovered a completely novel neuropeptide gene in Nasonia, coding for peptides containing the C-terminal sequence RYamide. This gene has orthologs in nearly all arthropods with a sequenced genome, and its expression in mosquitoes was confirmed by mass spectrometry. No precursor could be identified for N-terminally extended FMRFamides, even though their putative G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) is present in the Nasonia genome. Neither the precursor nor the putative receptor could be identified for allatostatin-B, capa, the glycoprotein hormones GPA2/GPB5, kinin, proctolin, sex peptide, and sulfakinin, arguing that these signaling systems are truly absent in the wasp. Also, antidiuretic factors, allatotropin, and NPLP-like precursors are missing in Nasonia, but here the receptors have not been identified in any insect, so far. Nasonia (Hymenoptera) has the lowest number of neuropeptide precursor genes compared to Drosophila melanogaster, Aedes aegypti (both Diptera), Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera), Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera), Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera), and Acyrthosiphon pisum (Hemiptera).

Pollinators are potentially at risk being exposed to pesticides and the main route of exposure is direct contact, in some cases ingestion, of contaminated materials such as pollen, nectar, flowers and foliage. To date there are no suitable methods for predicting pesticide exposure for pollinators, therefore official procedures to assess pesticide risk are based on a Hazard Quotient. Here we develop a procedure to assess exposure and risk for pollinators based on the foraging behaviour of honeybees (Apis mellifera) and using this species as indicator representative of pollinating insects. The method was applied in 13 European field sites with different climatic, landscape and land use characteristics. The level of risk during the crop growing season was evaluated as a function of the active ingredients used and application regime. Risk levels were primarily determined by the agronomic practices employed (i.e. crop type, pest control method, pesticide use), and there was a clear temporal partitioning of risks through time. Generally the risk was higher in sites cultivated with permanent crops, such as vineyard and olive, than in annual crops, such as cereals and oil seed rape. The greatest level of risk is generally found at the beginning of the growing season for annual crops and later in June-July for permanent crops. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Pesticide; Pollinators; Procedure; Risk assessment",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149466797

This often consists of sucrose inverted using lemon juice, as beekeepers in remote rural areas cannot obtain citric acid for this purpose. In order to determine the optimum composition for these energetic diets, it is necessary to carry out both laboratory and field studies, to evaluate different proportions among the components usually used by the beekeepers for this supplementary feed. For these experiments, an appropriate statistical methodology, for instance, using the modelling of mixtures, allows a reduction in the number of treatments necessary. The present work studied the optimization of the following components: water, sugar and lemon juice, used in an energetic diet to maximize the longevity of bees kept in the laboratory. Our results showed that the optimum mixture was 47.50% water, 46.25% granulated sugar together with 6.25% lemon juice. © IBRA 2010.","Africanized honey bees; Apis mellifera; Curves of level; Diet; Extreme vertices design; Lemon juice; Longevity; Process variable",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149290646

Using the same data set developed to perform a monofactorial analysis (PloS ONE 4: e6481, 2009), we conducted a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis in an attempt to better understand the relative importance and interrelations among different risk variables in explaining CCD. Fifty-five exploratory variables were used to construct two CART models: one model with and one model without a cost of misclassifying a CCD-diagnosed colony as a non-CCD colony. The resulting model tree that permitted for misclassification had a sensitivity and specificity of 85 and 74%, respectively. Although factors measuring colony stress (e.g., adult bee physiological measures, such as fluctuating asymmetry or mass of head) were important discriminating values, six of the 19 variables having the greatest discriminatory value were pesticide levels in different hive matrices. Notably, coumaphos levels in brood (a miticide commonly used by beekeepers) had the highest discriminatory value and were highest in control (healthy) colonies. Our CART analysis provides evidence that CCD is probably the result of several factors acting in concert, making afflicted colonies more susceptible to disease. This analysis highlights several areas that warrant further attention, including the effect of sublethal pesticide exposure on pathogen prevalence and the role of variability in bee tolerance to pesticides on colony survivorship. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.","Apis mellifera; classification and regression tree analysis; Colony collapse disorder; epidemiology; pathogens",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957725889

By showing distance-sensitive brain gene expression, our findings also significantly extend the emerging paradigm of the genome as a dynamic regulator of behavior, that is particularly responsive to stimuli important in social life. © 2010 The Authors.

This article reviews studies further implicating the circadian clock in complex social behaviors in bees. The article starts by introducing honeybee social behavior and sociality and then briefly summarizes current findings on the molecular biology and neuroanatomy of the circadian system of honeybees that point to molecular similarities to the mammalian clockwork rather than to that of Drosophila. Foraging is a social behavior in honeybees that relies on the circadian clock for timing visits to flowers, time-compensated sun-compass navigation, and dance communication used by foragers to recruit nestmates to rewarding flower patches. The circadian clock is also important for the social organization of honeybee societies. Social factors influence the ontogeny of circadian rhythms and are important for social synchronization of worker activities. Both queen and worker bees switch between activities with and without circadian rhythms. In workers this remarkable plasticity is associated with the division of labor; nurse bees care for the brood around the clock with similar levels of clock gene expression throughout the day, whereas foragers have strong behavioral circadian rhythms with oscillating brain clock gene levels. This plasticity in circadian rhythms is regulated by direct contact with the brood and is context-specific in that nurse bees that are removed from the hive exhibit activity with strong behavioral and molecular rhythms. These studies on the sociochronobiology of honeybees and comparative studies with other social insects suggest that the evolution of sociality has influenced the characteristics of the circadian system in honeybees. © 2010 Sage Publications.","Apis mellifera; circadian rhythms; division of labor; evolution; social behavior; sun-compass orientation",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957257013

There are some protein compounds in honey in addition to sugars, lipids and mineral compounds. Relative quantity of proteins in honey compound is considered as a quality index. Determination of the quantity of plant origin (pollen) and animal origin (honey bee) of the proteins of honey is an important but unknown issue. Knowing this ratio can be an index for quality control of honey. In this research, 6 honey ""unifloral"" samples were collected from ""Sirachal"" region located in Karaj-Chaloos Road, 40 km from North of Karaj in different months. After a quantity of each honey sample was diluted with water, pollens were counted in 10 gram of each sample using optical microscope. Total quantity of proteins in each sample was specified through method of ""Bradford"". Electrophorus profile of pollen proteins used by bees, pollens in honey and honey proteins were prepared and compared through electrophorus method of Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis. Statistical study of tests results and repeating them was done by T test. The results showed that honey collected in June-July has the most quantity of pollen (680000 in each 10 g honey). Average of the whole pollen proteins that were mostly used by honey bees is 35.91±5.56 of the dry weight of the pollens. Honey collected in June-July with the most amounts of pollens has the most quantity of total protein means 0.99% of the total weight of the pollen and honey collected in Aug.-Sep. with the least amount of pollen (147000 in each 10 g) has the least quantity of total protein means 0.37% of the total weight of the pollen. Average protein of the whole honey during hive establishment is 0.64±0.26% and average quantity of pollen proteins of honey in this period is 0.24±0.14%. Since proteins are among very valuable compounds in human's nutrition and plays vital role on growth and health of cells, quantity of the whole protein of honey is one of the quality indices and since based on the tests carried out in this research, about 1/3 of proteins of honey penetrate it through pollens, ratio of pollen proteins to total proteins of honey can be considered as a new index for examination of honey quality.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649810297

The aim of this study was to evaluate the antidiabetic effect of propolis through an analysis of the expression and enzyme activity of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and to elucidate the mechanism by which propolis inhibits G6Pase gene expression. When HepG2 cells were incubated in high glucose media (25 mm), G6Pase expression was induced. Propolis significantly reduced the expression and enzyme activity of G6Pase; however, the hypoglycemic effect was not abolished by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, and by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, U0126. Propolis inhibited the activity of GSK3α and β via the inhibition of serine and tyrosine phosphorylation, specifically, Y279 for GSK3α and Y216 for GSK3β. The phosphorylations of Y279 and Y216 occur through autophosphorylation by GSK3α/β and are involved in their own activity. Although propolis showed antioxidant activity, antidiabetic effect of propolis was not influenced by hydrogen peroxide and N-acetylcysteine. These results suggest that propolis inhibits the expression of G6Pase by inhibiting the autophosphorylation of Y279 and Y216 of GSK3α and β, respectively, which are involved in the activation of GSK3. These findings suggest that propolis may be a potential antidiabetic agent for the treatment of insulin-insensitive diabetes. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","antidiabetes; antioxidant; G6Pase; GSK3; LY294002; phosphorylation; propolis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649425872

Integrated pest management strategies for control of this pest include the judicious use of insecticides. To monitor field populations of Varroa mite for insecticide resistance, a glass vial bioassay procedure was developed to use in the development of a resistance management strategy. Diagnostic concentrations needed to separate susceptible genotypes from resistant individuals were determined for Cypermethrin (0.1 μg per vial), fluvalinate (5.0 μg per vial), malathion (0.01 μg per vial), coumaphos (10.0 μg per vial), diazinon (5.0 μg per vial), methomyl (0.5 μg per vial), propoxur (0.1 μg per vial), and endosulfan (2.5 μg per vial). Resistance to organophosphorus insecticides (malathion, coumaphos) and pyrethroids (cypermetrhrin, fluvalinate) was widespread in both La Media Ranch, TX, and Wewahitchka, FL, from 2007 to 2009. There was no resistance to endosulfan, diazinon, methomyl, and propoxur in field populations of Varroa mite in the two locations where resistance was monitored. The seasonal patterns of resistance in Wewahitchka were different from those of La Media Ranch. In the former location, the frequency of resistance to all insecticides tested decreased significantly from 2007 to 2009, whereas it increased in the latter location. Resistance levels were unstable, suggesting that resistance could be successfully managed. The results validate use of the glass vial bioassay to monitor for resistance in Varroa mite and provide the basis for the development of a resistance management strategy designed to extend the efficacy of all classes of insecticides used for control of Varroa mite. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.","Apis mellifera; monitoring insecticide resistance; Varroa destructor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957733121

The exemplars of the first three tribes listed all have the opening of the labial gland on the hypopharynx close to the opening to the pharynx rather than at the apex of the prementum as in the Apinae. Furthermore one of the exemplars of the Allodapini (Allodape ceratinoides Gribodo) agrees in this respect with the three other tribes. However, the other allodapine exemplar (Macrogalea candida (Smith)) has the opening at the apex of the greatly modified labium. Numerous preserved specimens of this species exhibited a conspicuous amorphous, presumably postmortem discharge from the labial gland, suggesting that in this species the labial gland had taken on a new, unknown function compared with other xylocopines (none of which spin cocoons). The study concludes that the hypopharyngeal position of the opening of the duct from the labial gland, far from the premental apex, is a strong larval synapomorphy of the Xylocopinae because it is found in exemplars of all four tribes of the subfamily and has not been reported elsewhere among bees. Although the mature larva of Macrogalea candida has the labial gland opening close to the labial palpi in front of the hypopharynx and therefore presumably on the prementum, the greatly modified labiomaxillary region and the evidence that the gland discharges large quantities of a secretion suggest that the position of the opening is autapomorphic. © 2010 Kansas Entomological Society.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650161745

Regarding NS, it was verified that the treatments with smoke + seven castor bean and smoke + 20% coffee husk were different from the treatment without and with smoke. The other treatments did not differ significantly with respect to the use of smoke or its absence. The application of coffee husk and castor bean did not interfere in the development of the population, suggesting that these compounds were not toxic.

Polistes is ""primitively eusocial"" by virtue of having contextdependent caste determination and no morphological differences between castes. Even so, Polistes colonies have a temporal pattern in which most female larvae reared by the foundress become workers, and most reared by workers become future-reproductive gynes. This pattern is hypothesized to reflect development onto two pathways, which may utilize mechanisms that regulate diapause in other insects. Using expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for Polistes metricus we selected candidate genes differentially expressed in other insects in three categories: 1) diapause vs. non-diapause phenotypes and/or worker vs. queen differentiation, 2) behavioral subcastes of worker honey bees, and 3) no a priori expectation of a role in worker/gyne development. We also used a non-targeted proteomics screen to test for peptide/protein abundance differences that could reflect larval developmental divergence. We found that foundress-reared larvae (putative worker-destined) and worker-reared larvae (putative gyne-destined) differed in quantitative expression of sixteen genes, twelve of which were associated with caste and/or diapause in other insects, and they also differed in abundance of nine peptides/proteins. Some differentially-expressed genes are involved in diapause regulation in other insects, and other differentially-expressed genes and proteins are involved in the insulin signaling pathway, nutrient metabolism, and caste determination in highly social bees. Differential expression of a gene and a peptide encoding hexameric storage proteins is especially noteworthy. Although not conclusive, our results support hypotheses of 1) larval developmental pathway divergence that can lead to caste bias in adults and 2) nutritional differences as the foundation of the pathway divergence. Finally, the differential expression in Polistes larvae of genes and proteins also differentially expressed during queen vs. worker caste development in honey bees may indicate that regulatory mechanisms of caste outcomes share similarities between primitively eusocial and advanced eusocial Hymenoptera. © 2010 Hunt et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956277107

Bandeirantes 3900, 14049-900, Ribeiro Preto, Brazil","Background. During mating, insect males eject accessory gland proteins (Acps) into the female genital tract. These substances are known to affect female post-mating behavior and physiology. In addition, they may harm the female, e.g., in reducing its lifespan. This is interpreted as a consequence of sexual antagonistic co-evolution. Whereas sexual conflict abounds in non-social species, the peculiar life history of social insects (ants, bees, wasps) with lifelong pair-bonding and no re-mating aligns the reproductive interests of the sexes. Harming the female during mating would negatively affect male fitness and sexual antagonism is therefore not expected. Indeed, mating appears to increase female longevity in at least one ant species. Acps are presumed to play a role in this phenomenon, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In this study, we investigated genes, which are preferentially expressed in male accessory glands of the ant Leptothorax gredleri, to determine which proteins might be transferred in the seminal fluid. Results. By a suppression subtractive hybridization protocol we obtained 20 unique sequences (USs). Twelve had mutual best matches with genes predicted for Apis mellifera and Nasonia vitripennis. Functional information (Gene Ontology) was available only for seven of these, including intracellular signaling, energy-dependent transport and metabolic enzyme activities. The remaining eight USs did not match sequences from other species. Six genes were further analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR in three life cycle stages of male ants. A gene with carboxy-lyase activity and one of unpredicted function were significantly overexpressed in accessory glands of sexually mature males. Conclusions. Our study is the first one to investigate differential gene expression in ants in a context related to mating. Our findings indicate that male accessory glands of L. gredleri express a series of genes that are unique to this species, possibly representing novel genes, in addition to conserved ones for which functions can be predicted. Identifying differentially expressed genes might help to better understand molecular mechanisms involved in reproductive processes in eusocial Hymenoptera. While the novel genes could account for rapidly evolving ones driven by intra-sexual conflict between males, conserved genes imply that rather beneficial traits might get fixed by a process described as inter-sexual cooperation between males and females. © 2010 Oppelt et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956495308

Birgus latro Linnaeus, 1767, the giant robber crab or coconut crab (Anomura, Coenobitidae), is the largest land-living arthropod and inhabits Indo-Pacific islands such as Christmas Island. B. latro has served as a model in numerous studies of physiological aspects related to the conquest of land by crustaceans. From an olfactory point of view, a transition from sea to land means that molecules need to be detected in gas phase instead of in water solution. Previous studies have provided physiological evidence that terrestrial hermit crabs (Coenobitidae) such as B. latro have a sensitive and well differentiated sense of smell. Here we analyze the brain, in particular the olfactory processing areas of B. latro, by morphological analysis followed by 3 D reconstruction and immunocytochemical studies of synaptic proteins and a neuropeptide.Results: The primary and secondary olfactory centers dominate the brain of B. latro and together account for ca. 40% of the neuropil volume in its brain. The paired olfactory neuropils are tripartite and composed of more than 1,000 columnar olfactory glomeruli, which are radially arranged around the periphery of the olfactory neuropils. The glomeruli are innervated ca. 90,000 local interneurons and ca. 160,000 projection neurons per side. The secondary olfactory centers, the paired hemiellipsoid neuropils, are targeted by the axons of these olfactory projection neurons. The projection neuron axonal branches make contact to ca. 250.000 interneurons (per side) associated with the hemiellipsoid neuropils. The hemiellipsoid body neuropil is organized into parallel neuropil lamellae, a design that is quite unusual for decapod crustaceans. The architecture of the optic neuropils and areas associated with antenna two suggest that B. latro has visual and mechanosensory skills that are comparable to those of marine Crustacea.Conclusions: In parallel to previous behavioral findings that B. latro has aerial olfaction, our results indicate that their central olfactory pathway is indeed most prominent. Similar findings from the closely related terrestrial hermit crab Coenobita clypeatus suggest that in Coenobitidae, olfaction is a major sensory modality processed by the brain, and that for these animals, exploring the olfactory landscape is vital for survival in their terrestrial habitat. Future studies on terrestrial members of other crustacean taxa such as Isopoda, Amphipoda, Astacida, and Brachyura will shed light on how frequently the establishment of an aerial sense of olfaction evolved in Crustacea during the transition from sea to land. Amounting to ca. 1,000,000, the numbers of interneurons that analyse the olfactory input in B. latro brains surpasses that in other terrestrial arthropods, as e.g. the honeybee Apis mellifera or the moth Manduca sexta, by two orders of magnitude suggesting that B. latro in fact is a land-living arthropod that has devoted a substantial amount of nervous tissue to the sense of smell. © 2010 Krieger et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956495099

We tested the antimicrobial activity of a Chilean honey made by Apis mellifera (honeybee) originating from the Ulmo tree (Eucryphia cordifolia), against selected strains of bacteria.Methods: Ulmo 90 honey was compared with manuka UMF®25+ (Comvita®) honey and a laboratory synthesised (artificial) honey. An agar well diffusion assay and a 96 well minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) spectrophotometric-based assay were used to assess antimicrobial activity against five strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Results: Initial screening with the agar diffusion assay demonstrated that Ulmo 90 honey had greater antibacterial activity against all MRSA isolates tested than manuka honey and similar activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The MIC assay, showed that a lower MIC was observed with Ulmo 90 honey (3.1% - 6.3% v/v) than with manuka honey (12.5% v/v) for all five MRSA isolates. For the E. coli and Pseudomonas strains equivalent MICs were observed (12.5% v/v). The MIC for artificial honey was 50% v/v. The minimum bactericidal concentration for all isolates tested for Ulmo 90 honey was identical to the MIC. Unlike manuka honey, Ulmo 90 honey activity is largely due to hydrogen peroxide production.Conclusions: Due to its high antimicrobial activity, Ulmo 90 may warrant further investigation as a possible alternative therapy for wound healing. © 2010 Sherlock et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956469867

This study was undertaken to examine the effect of small cell size on the reproductive success of the mite, as a method of non-chemical control in the Northern European honeybee Apis mellifera mellifera. Test colonies with alternating small and standard cell size brood combs were sampled over a three-month period and the population biology of the mites evaluated. To ensure high varroa infestation levels, all colonies were infested with mites from a host colony prior to commencement. A total of 2229 sealed cells were opened and the varroa mite families recorded. While small-sized cells were more likely to be infested than the standard cells, mite intensity and abundance were similar in both cell sizes.

A key determinant of colony mortality is the prevalence of the parasite within a colony. Prevalence depends upon transmission rates, which vary depending upon the age of potential hosts. Honey bee cuticular hydrocarbons change with age, and have been suggested to be the cue used by tracheal mites to determine whether they move to a potential host. Recently, honey bees pupated at a reduced temperature were found to have a significantly higher susceptibility to tracheal-mite infestation. In this study experiments were conducted to determine whether this susceptibility was due to a change in chemical cues. Cuticular compounds were significantly different between bees pupated at 34 °C and 30 °C, as predicted. However, behavioural tests showed conclusively that the increased susceptibility of bees pupated at the lower temperature could not be explained by these chemical differences. Other factors, such as changes in bee physiology, reduced mobility and cognitive ability, that have been shown to be caused by reduced pupation temperature, are suggested as potential mechanisms. Interestingly, these experiments provide evidence that tracheal mites only respond to gustatory and not olfactory cues. The implications of this for the behavioural strategies adopted by mites to maximise safe transmission, and a new model for mite transfer are discussed. © 2010 INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences.","Acarapis woodi; Apis mellifera; Milbenwanderung; Tracheenmilbe; Verpuppungstemperatur",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958500835

However, there has been no report on cryopreservation of honeybee eggs by vitrification. In an attempt to define a preliminary procedure of cryopreservation of honeybee eggs by vitrification, queen honeybee born worker eggs (worker eggs) were stored through vitrification in liquid nitrogen up to 1 h, and then post-vitrification survival of the vitrified worker eggs in vitro and their hatching rates during maturation in vivo were observed using microscopic and close visual inspections. The procedure of cryopreservation by vitrification included dechorionation with sodium hypochlorite and permeabilization with isopropyl alcohol; equilibration by addition of loading solution (i.e., 25% vitrification storage solution) and dehydration by gradual replacement of loading solution with vitrification storage solution; cooling in liquid nitrogen vapor right before droplet vitrification in liquid nitrogen; and recovery in liquid nitrogen vapor right after storage in liquid nitrogen, thawing at temperature of thawing medium (5% sucrose in TC 100-insect medium) and rehydration by gradual replacement of vitrification storage solution with rehydration solution (5% fetal bovine serum in TC 100-insect medium). It was found that among the worker eggs experiencing cyropreservation by vitrification, 1.25% of them were successfully passed through the four life stages, viz., egg, larva, pupa, and adult. In summary, it can be inferred that although a majority of worker eggs were dead after cyropreservation by vitrification, a few of them were developed into larvae, pupae, and finally emerged as adults. © 2010 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.","Cryopreservation; Egg; Honeybee worker; Vitrification",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149375059

Differential gene expression of two honey bee species induced by V. destructor infection was investigated by constructing two suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) libraries, as first steps toward elucidating molecular mechanisms of Varroa tolerance. From the SSH libraries, we obtained 289 high quality sequences which clustered into 132 unique sequences grouped in 26 contigs and 106 singlets where 49 consisted in A. cerana subtracted library and 83 in A. mellifera. Using BLAST, we found that 85% sequences had counterpart known genes whereas 15% were undescribed. A Gene Ontology analysis classified 51 unique sequences into different functional categories. Eight of these differentially expressed genes, representative of different regulation patterns, were confirmed by qRT-PCR. Upon the mite induction, the differentially expressed genes from both bee species were different, except hex 110 gene, which was up-regulated in A. cerana but down-regulated in A. mellifera, and Npy-r gene, which was down-regulated in both species.

Our aim was to assess the consequences on Apis mellifera colony development by using beeswax sheets adulterated with increasing concentrations of paraffin. This research was conducted during January-February of 2007, lasting 43 days, and carried out in 12 colonies located in General Pueyrredón District, Buenos Aires, Argentina. For this purpose, we performed an assay using three different beeswax sheets (with 0%, 20% and 40% paraffin contents); two combs were placed in each hive, each one consisted of two sections of beeswax foundation containing 0% and 20% or 0% and 40% paraffin concentrations. The percentages of built area and brood survivorship index were measured for each beeswax section, resulting in no significant differences between areas built in pure and adulterated beeswax (P>0,05), notwithstanding a tendency to develop a larger built area in pure beeswax combs was observed. Survivorship brood index was greater in beeswaxes with 40% paraffin content versus 0% paraffin (0,78±0,06 and 0,65±0,08 respectively; P=0,036). Apis mellifera colonies tolerate percentages up to 40% of paraffin in combs and, taking in mind that beeswax recycled from bee-combs contains lipo-soluble contaminants, paraffin probably plays a role as diluting agent to drop their concentration, and hence favoring brood survivorship of bees in them. However, it is important to notice that quality of adulterated beeswax it is not apt for other industries.","Adulteration; Apis mellifera; Beeswax; Comb-building; Paraffin; Survivorship",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956267518

The castes and males from A. mellifera have a distinct morphology, physiology and behaviour that correlate with their roles in the society and are characterized by some brain polymorphisms. Compound eyes are one of the characteristics that differ among the castes and sexes. A. mellifera is a holometabolous insect; therefore, the development of adult organs during metamorphosis, which will produce these differences, requires the precise coordination of three main programmed cellular processes: proliferation, differentiation and death. These processes take place simultaneously during pupation. Our purpose was to investigate cell division and death in the optic lobes (OL) of workers, queens and males during pupation to identify how the differences in the compound eyes in adults of these classes are achieved. The results showed that OL differentiation follows a similar pattern in the three classes of individuals studied, without structural differences in their development. The main non-structural differences involve cell division, mortality rates and timing. The results suggest a modelling of the brain during differentiation, which contributes to the specific functions of each individual class. © Indian Academy of Sciences.","Apoptosis; Bee; Brain; Cell division; Nervous system",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651340629

These chemical signals comprise a mixture of hydrocarbons, wax esters, fatty acids, aldehydes and alcohols. In this study, we detected several long chain aliphatic alcohols ranging from C18-C32 in honey bees and the level of these alcohols varied in each body segment. C18:0Alc and C20:0Alc are more pronounced in the head, whereas C22:0Alc to C32Alc are abundant in the abdomen. One of the cDNAs coding for a fatty acyl-CoA reductase (AmFAR1) involved in the synthesis of fatty alcohols was isolated and characterized. AmFAR1 was ubiquitously expressed in all body segments with the predominance in the head of honey bees. Heterologous expression of AmFAR1 in yeast revealed that AmFAR1 could convert a wide range of fatty acids (14:0-22:0) to their corresponding alcohols, with stearic acid 18:0 as the most preferred substrate. The substrate preference and the expression pattern of AmFAR1 were correlated with the level of total fatty alcohols in bees. Reconstitution of the wax biosynthetic pathway by heterologous expression of AmFAR1, together with Euglena wax synthase led to the high level production of medium to long chain wax monoesters in yeast. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Apis mellifera; Fatty acyl-CoA reductase; Fatty alcohol; Honey bee; Wax ester",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956181781

An increasingly prevalent disease of managed honeybees is caused by the microsporidian Nosema ceranae. Microsporidia are basal fungi and obligate parasites with much-reduced genomic and cellular components. A recent genome-sequencing effort for N. ceranae indicated the presence of machinery for RNA silencing in this species, suggesting that RNA interference (RNAi) might be exploited to regulate Nosema gene expression within bee hosts. Here we used controlled laboratory experiments to show that double-stranded RNA homologous to specific N. ceranae ADP/ATP transporter genes can specifically and differentially silence transcripts encoding these proteins. This inhibition also affects Nosema levels and host physiology. Gene silencing could be mediated solely by Nosema or in concert with known systemic RNAi mechanisms in their bee hosts. These results are novel for the microsporidia and provide a possible avenue for controlling a disease agent implicated in severe honeybee colony losses. Moreover, since microsporidia are pathogenic in several known veterinary and human diseases, this advance may have broader applications in the future for disease control.

Enzymes involved in JH catabolism can play major roles during metamorphosis and reproduction, such as the JH epoxide hydrolase (JHEH), which degrades JH through hydration of the epoxide moiety to form JH diol, and JH esterase (JHE), which hydrolyzes the methyl ester to produce JH acid. In the honey bee, JH has been co-opted for additional functions, mainly in caste differentiation and in age-related behavioral development of workers, where the activity of both enzymes could be important for JH titer regulation. Similarity searches for jheh candidate genes in the honey bee genome revealed a single Amjheh gene. Sequence analysis, quantification of Amjheh transcript levels and Western blot assays using an AmJHEH-specific antibody generated during this study revealed that the AmJHEH found in the fat body shares features with the microsomal JHEHs from several insect species. Using a partition assay we demonstrated that AmJHEH has a negligible role in JH degradation, which, in the honey bee, is thus performed primarily by JHE. High AmJHEH levels in larvae and adults were related to the ingestion of high loads of lipids, suggesting that AmJHEH has a role in dietary lipid catabolism. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Honey bee; Juvenile hormone epoxide hydrolase; Juvenile hormone esterase; Lipid metabolism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955176658

Hemolymph levels of dopamine and N-acetyldopamine were found to increase at the time of onset of mating flight activity and those of dopamine decreased thereafter. Both locomotor and flight activities increased in parallel with hemolymph dopamine levels but the increased activity levels were maintained following decline of dopamine levels. Brain and meso-metathoracic ganglia levels of dopamine showed a similar developmental profile to hemolymph dopamine levels. Locomotor activities were temporarily inhibited by injection of a dopamine-receptor antagonist (cis(Z)-flupenthixol) into the thorax, and were enhanced by injection of a dopamine-receptor agonist (6,7-ADTN). These results suggest that dopamine regulates locomotor activities for mating and plays a role downstream of JH in premature males in honeybees. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Apis mellifera; Dopamine; Honeybee; Locomotion; Reproduction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955175330

We measured forager and guard bee antennal responses evoked by two major components of mandibular gland secretions of the Asiatic honeybee, Apis cerana. Membrane potentials of antennal sensilla were measured after exposure to three concentrations of the synthetic alarm pheromones 2-heptanone and (Z)-11-eicosen-1-ol using a potentiostat (EA161) connected to an e-corder (ED401) with microelectrodes. The resting membrane potential of A. cerana foragers and guards was -55.23 ± 1.44 and -56.41 ± 1.21. mV, respectively. The membrane potential of foragers after exposure to 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0% 2-heptanone was -5.32 ± 0.46, -8.41 ± 1.33 and -11.53 ± 2.16. mV, respectively. The membrane potential of guards was -5.49 ± 1.66, -8.46 ± 1.32 and -7.31 ± 3.46. mV, respectively. Exposure of foragers to 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0% (Z)-11-eicosen-1-ol induced membrane potentials of -24.00 ± 6.56, -36.36 ± 5.18 and -14.60 ± 8.20. mV, respectively; for guards they were -47.62 ± 1.46, -46.08 ± 0.87 and -9.35 ± 1.96. mV, respectively. The highest membrane potential was found in foragers exposed to 1.0% 2-heptanone. The membrane potentials of foragers were higher than that of guards except at the highest concentration (10.0%) of both pheromones.

In our effort to discover new antimicrobial peptides from the endoparasitoid wasp Pteromalus puparum, we identified an antibacterial cDNA clone that codes a fragment with high amino acid sequence similarity to abaecin. The proline-rich peptide (YVPPVQKPHPNGPKFPTFP, named PP30) was chemically synthesized and characterized in this study. Antimicrobial assays indicated that the cationic peptide was active against both Gram-negative and positive bacteria, but not active against fungi tested. No hemolytic activity was observed against human erythrocytes after 1. h incubation at concentration of 125μM or below. The antibacterial activity of PP30 against Escherichia coli was attenuated in the presence of increasing concentrations of NaCl. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) examination of PP30-treated E. coli cells showed morphological changes in the cells and extensive damage to the cell membranes. The circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy studies indicated that PP30 formed random coil structures in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 50% TFE and 25. mM SDS solution.

Instead of a conditioned stimulus (e.g. odor) signaling the presence of a reward, the stimulus (e.g. odor) is present in the environment except just prior to the presence of the reward. Thus, the absence of the stimulus, or offset of the stimulus (e.g. absence of odor), serves as a conditioned stimulus and is the reward cue. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) were used as a model invertebrate system, and the proboscis-conditioning paradigm was used as the test procedure. Using both simple Pavlovian conditioning and discrimination-learning protocols, animals learned to associate the onset of an odor as conditioned stimuli when paired with a sucrose reward. They could also learn to associate the onset of a puff of air with a sucrose reward. However, bees could not associate the offset of an order stimulus with the presentation of a sucrose reward in either a simple conditioning or a discrimination-learning situation.

To inhibit cadmium-induced damage, cells increase the expression of genes encoding stress-response proteins. The transcription of many stress-responsive genes, including those that encode metallothioneins, glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) and heat shock proteins have been reported. The aim of this work was to investigate in Eisenia fetida the genes whose expressions are regulated following exposure to cadmium. mRNA differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze gene expression in E. fetida exposed to 50 mg/l cadmium solution. Among the derived cDNA clones sequenced, we found 15 genes up-regulated and 12 down-regulated in response to cadmium exposure. The translated amino acid sequences of eight clones were similar to the Lumbricus terrestris hemoglobin dodecamer, Tribolium castaneum membrane protein, Escherichia coli UMN026 DNA-binding transcriptional activator, Brugia malayi immunoglobulin, Homo sapiens cell growth-inhibiting protein, Apis mellifera poly U binding factor, Escherichia fergusonii copper transporter, and the mRNA that encodes E. coli K-12 cytoplasmic insertase into membrane protein.

Some of these genes may have effects from early development and onward by influencing hormonal systems that are active during different life-stages leading to complex associations, or suites, of traits. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) have been used extensively in experiments on the genetic and hormonal control of complex social behavior, but the relationships between their early developmental processes and adult behavioral variation are not well understood. Bidirectional selective breeding on social food-storage behavior produced two honey bee strains, each with several sublines, that differ in an associated suite of anatomical, physiological, and behavioral traits found in unselected wild type bees. Using these genotypes, we document strain-specific changes during larval, pupal, and early adult life-stages for the central insect hormones juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroids. Strain differences correlate with variation in female reproductive anatomy (ovary size), which can be influenced by JH during development, and with secretion rates of ecdysteroid from the ovaries of adults. Ovary size was previously assigned to the suite of traits of honey bee food-storage behavior. Our findings support that bidirectional selection on honey bee social behavior acted on pleiotropic gene networks. These networks may bias a bee's adult phenotype by endocrine effects on early developmental processes that regulate variation in reproductive traits. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957150342

(Hymenoptera: Apidae), suffer simultaneously from multiple stress factors, raising concern that multiple stressors could be interacting to compound bee stress in an additive or synergistic fashion. We tested two null hypotheses: 1) Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman (Acari: Varroidae) (=varroa) and Aethina tumida Murray (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) do not interact such that the number of one affects the number or density of the other and 2) bee damage from one does not change in response to changing levels of the other. In a split-split plot design replicated in 2 yr and two states, experimental apiaries were established and each manipulated to achieve one of five average ± SE colony adult A. tumida populations: 0; 285 ± 6; 721 ± 5; 1,544 ± 14; or 3,175 ± 90. Within each apiary, the population of varroa mites in each colony was manipulated to achieve one of three average ± SE colony mite populations: 763 ± 121; 1,111 ± 155; or 1,856 ± 300. On a one-way basis, there was a predictable increase in measures of bee morbidity with increasing densities of each pest. Colony varroa mite levels decreased as apiary-wide A. tumida levels increased.

In this framework, coupling behavioral measurements of proboscis extension and invasive recordings of neural activity has been difficult because proboscis movements usually introduce brain movements that affect physiological preparations. Here we took advantage of a new conditioning protocol, the aversive olfactory conditioning of the sting extension reflex, which does not generate this problem. We achieved the first simultaneous recordings of conditioned sting extension responses and calcium imaging of antennal lobe activity, thus revealing on-line processing of olfactory information during conditioning trials. Based on behavioral output we distinguished learners and non-learners and analyzed possible learning-dependent changes in antennal lobe activity. We did not find differences between glomerular responses to the CS+ and the CS- in learners. Unexpectedly, we found that during conditioning trials non-learners exhibited a progressive decrease in physiological responses to odors, irrespective of their valence. This effect could neither be attributed to a fitness problem nor to abnormal dye bleaching. We discuss the absence of learning-induced changes in the antennal lobe of learners and the decrease in calcium responses found in non-learners. Further studies will have to extend the search for functional plasticity related to aversive learning to other brain areas and to look on a broader range of temporal scales. © 2010 Roussel, Sandoz and Giurfa.","Antennal lobe; Apis mellifera; Aversive conditioning; Calcium imaging; Honeybee; Learning; Memory; Sting extension reflex",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960389845

The baculovirus donor vector for expression of scFv against G-Re (GRe-scFv) was constructed to contain honeybee melittin signal sequence to accelerate secretion of the recombinant GRe-scFv into the haemolymph of silkworm larvae. Functional recombinant GRe-scFv was purified by cation exchange chromatography followed by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. The yield of purified GRe-scFv was 6.5 mg per 13 silkworm larvae, which is equivalent to 650 mg/l of the haemolymph, exhibiting extremely higher yield than that expressed in Escherichia coli (1.7 mg/l of culture medium). It was revealed from characterization that GRe-scFv retained similar characteristic of the parental monoclonal antibody (MAb) against G-Re (MAb-4G10), making it possible to develop indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) for quality control of total ginsenosides in various ginsengs. The detectable range for calibration of G-Re by developed icELISA shows 0.05-10 μg/ml. These results clearly suggested that the silkworm expression system is quite useful for the expression of functional scFv that frequently required time- and cost-consuming re-folding when it expressed in E. coli. © The Authors 2010.

We examined the effect of Methyl Parathion (MeP), an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor of the organo-phosphate family, on the learning and recall of visual and olfactory discrimination tasks in honeybees. One of our expectations was to observe the effects induced by both the nicotinic and muscarinic systems, as the blocking of acetylcholinesterase should induce an increase in the activity of both systems. We were also interested in knowing whether the type of tasks could influence the results. The visual tasks involved learning to discriminate the orientation of gratings in a Y-maze; the olfactory task involved learning to discriminate odours in a proboscis extension reflex (PER) paradigm. The results indicate that MeP treatment enhances recall of learned tasks in the visual and olfactory domains, but it does not affect the acquisition phase in either domain. Surprisingly, MeP treatment led to muscarinic-like effects but failed to mimic the nicotinic-like effects already described in relation to learning phases in honeybees. Implications for the role of cholinergic pathways in learning and memory and the nature of their involvement are discussed, and a hypothesis relating to the organisation of the cholinergic system and the relationship between the nicotinic and muscarinic systems in honeybees is proposed. The results are also discussed in terms of their ecotoxicological consequences. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Anticholinesterase; Apis mellifera; Associative learning; Cholinergic system; Discrimination learning; Ecotoxicology; Muscarinic; Nicotinic; Non-target species; Organo-phosphates; Pesticide",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955175295

In one well-studied example, the division of labor among worker honey bees involves a stereotyped yet plastic pattern of behavioral and physiological maturation. Early in life, workers perform brood care and other in-hive tasks and have large internal nutrient stores; later in life, they forage for nectar and pollen outside the hive and have small nutrient stores. The pace of maturation depends on colony conditions, and the environmental, physiological, and genomic mechanisms by which this occurs are being actively investigated. Here we review current knowledge of the mechanisms by which a key environmental variable, nutritional status, influences worker honey bee division of labor. These studies demonstrate that changes in individual nutritional status and conserved food-related molecular and hormonal pathways regulate the age at which individual bees begin to forage. We then outline ways in which systems biology approaches, enabled by the sequencing of the honey bee genome, will allow researchers to gain deeper insight into nutritional regulation of honey bee behavior, and phenotypic plasticity in general. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952115883

However, whether these changes are active host defence mechanisms or parasitic manipulations or simply incidental byproducts of the infection is not always clear. It has been suggested that understanding the proximate mechanisms of these changes as well as comparative studies could help distinguish these alternatives better. Behavioural fever is a common response to an infection in many animals and we investigated the phenomenon in the novel host-parasite relationship between the honeybee and the temperature-sensitive microsporidian Nosema ceranae. Our results show that infected bees prefer higher temperatures and even though this seems to benefit the pathogen, the proximate mechanism underlying this change is the pathological stress underlying the infection. Especially because it is a new host-parasite relationship, it is best to label the observed behavioural change as a case of incidental benefit although this does not rule out selection acting on it. We discuss the importance of looking at the behavioural outcomes of host-parasite relationships and the importance of studying them at multiple levels for understanding their origin and maintenance.

Insects, with their miniature brains, have evolved a simple strategy to find their nests or profitable food sources; they approach a goal by finding a close match between the current view and a memorised retinotopic representation of the landmark constellation around the goal. Recent implementations of such a matching scheme use raw panoramic images ('image matching') and show that it is well suited to work on robots and even in natural environments. However, this matching scheme works only if relevant landmarks can be detected by their contrast and texture. Therefore, we tested how honeybees perform in localising a goal if the landmarks can hardly be distinguished from the background by such cues. We recorded the honeybees' flight behaviour with high-speed cameras and compared the search behaviour with computer simulations. We show that honeybees are able to use landmarks that have the same contrast and texture as the background and suggest that the bees use relative motion cues between the landmark and the background. These cues are generated on the eyes when the bee moves in a characteristic way in the vicinity of the landmarks. This extraordinary navigation performance can be explained by a matching scheme that includes snapshots based on optic flow amplitudes ('optic flow matching'). This new matching scheme provides a robust strategy for navigation, as it depends primarily on the depth structure of the environment. © 2010.

We investigated a potential molecular mechanism underlying a CAPE-mediated protective effect against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and analyzed the structure contributing to the CAPE effect. CAPE induced hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) α protein, concomitantly transactivating the HIF-1 target genes vascular endothelial growth factor and heme oxygenase-1, which play a protective role in I/R injury. CAPE delayed the degradation of HIF-1α protein in cells, which occurred by inhibition of HIF prolyl hydroxylase (HPH), the key enzyme for von Hippel-Lindau-dependent HIF-1α degradation. CAPE inhibition of HPH and induction of HIF-1α protein were neutralized by an elevated dose of iron. The catechol moiety, a chelating group, is essential for HPH inhibition, while hydrogenation of the double bond (-C. C-) in the Michael reaction acceptor markedly reduced potency. Removal of the phenethyl moiety of CAPE (substitution with the methyl moiety) severely deteriorated its inhibitory activity for HPH. Our data suggest that a beneficial effect of CAPE on I/R injury may be ascribed to the activation of HIF-1 pathway via inhibition of HPH and reveal that the chelating moiety of CAPE acted as a pharmacophore while the double bond and phenethyl moiety assisted in inhibiting HPH. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Caffeic acid phenethylester; HIF prolyl hydroxylase; Hypoxia-inducible factor-1; Ischemic/reperfusion injury; Structure-activity relationship",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955052559

Like many other reproductive proteins, the molecular evolution of SFPs is generally characterized by rapid and frequently adaptive evolution. However, the evolutionary processes underlying this often-documented pattern have not yet been confidently determined. A robust understanding of the processes governing SFP evolution will ultimately require identifying SFPs and characterizing their evolution in many different taxa, often where only limited genomic resources are available. Here, we report the first comprehensive molecular genetic and evolutionary analysis of SFPs conducted in Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies). We have identified 51 novel SFPs from two species of Heliconius butterflies (Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene) by combining ""indirect"" bioinformatic and expression analyses of expressed sequence tags from male accessory gland and wing tissues with ""direct"" proteomic analyses of spermatophores. Proteomic analyses identified fewer SFPs than the indirect criteria but gave consistent results. Of 51 SFPs, 40 were identified in both species but fewer than half could be functionally annotated via similarity searches (Blast, IPRscan, etc.). The majority of annotated Heliconius SFPs were predicted to be chymotrypsins. Comparisons of Heliconius SFPs with those from fruit fly, mosquito, honeybee, and cricket suggest that gene turnover is high among these proteins and that SFPs are rarely conserved across insect orders. Pairwise estimates of evolutionary rates between SFPs and nonreproductive proteins show that, on average, Heliconius SFPs are evolving rapidly. At least one of these SFPs is evolving adaptively (dN/dS > 1), implicating a role for positive selection in this rapid evolution. This work establishes a strong precedent for future research on the causes and consequences of reproductive protein evolution in the Lepidoptera. Butterflies and moths have an extremely rich history of organismal research, which will provide an informative ecological context for further molecular evolutionary investigations. © 2010 The Author.","accessory gland; Heliconius; Lepidoptera; seminal fluid proteins",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955932014

Contractions or relaxations were measured on relaxed or precontracted arteries, respectively. Melittin at lower concentrations (0.1-10 μg/ml) induced transient relaxation, and contraction at higher concentrations (≥7 μg/ml). The removing of the endothelium diminished the melittin-induced relaxation but did not affect the maximal contraction. The inhibition of prostaglandin and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis (by indomethacin and by N-omega-Nitro-l-arginine, respectively) and the use of K+ channel inhibitors (apamin and charybdotoxin) showed that melittin evoked relaxation via an endothelium-dependent mechanism (NO production), and by activation of charybdotoxin-sensitive K+ channels of smooth muscle. Apamin alone did not affect contraction or relaxation, but the inhibition of NO and prostanoid production revealed the involvement of apamin-sensitive K+ channels of smooth muscle in melittin-induced relaxation. Our data show that melittin and apamin could affect contractility of porcine LAD at concentrations similar to those encountered in multiple honeybee stings in humans.

The geographic distribution of the honeys studied is presented together with their affinities, through factor analysis and frequency tables. The study was based on the presence of E. pulverulenta pollen. Escallonia pulverulenta pollen percentages oscillated between 0.24% and 78.5%. Seventeen of the studied samples were designated as unifloral - i.e. samples showing more than 45% pollen of a determined plant species. Two of these corresponded to E. pulverulenta (corontillo, madroño or barraco) honeys. The remaining unifloral honeys correspond to 8 samples of Lotus uliginosus Schkuhr (birdsfoot trefoil), 2 samples of Aristotelia chilensis (Molina) Stuntz (maqui) and 1 sample of Escallonia rubra (Ruiz & Pav.)

The naturally occurring virus known as deformed wing virus (DWV) has long been linked with the collapse of mite infested honey bee colonies. We therefore surveyed the prevalence and persistence of DWV in four heavily infested untreated colonies (Survey 1), and five heavily infested colonies that were treated with an acaricide (Survey 2). The presence of DWV in samples of adult bees, sealed brood and mites was detected using an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Twenty individuals of each type were sampled monthly from each colony over the course of the study. During the summer, the proportion of adults, sealed brood and mites in which DWV was detected increased until either the colony died or was treated. When colonies were treated, thus removing mites from the colony, DWV became undetectable in the sealed bee brood at a similar rate to the loss of mites. The speed at which DWV became undetectable in adult workers depended, however, on the season, reflecting differences in life span between adult workers emerging in summer or winter. If treatment was delayed until October, DWV was still detected in adult bees during the winter even in the absence of mites. To reduce the viral load of the colony, therefore, mite treatment should be started no later than the end of August in order to remove the mites before production of the overwintering bees begins. © IBRA 2010.","Apis mellifera; Deformed wing virus; Threshold; Varroa destructor; Virus persistence; Virus prevalence",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953840716

A total of 12 mitotypes were observed, of which seven have not been previously described. Of the 172 samples, two mitotypes, A1 and A1d, accounted for 77% of the observed mitotypes, while mitotypes A1a, A26c, A26d, A29a, and A30 were only observed once. A possible reason why these new mitotypes have not been described before is because previous studies on AHB in the new world have relied primarily on PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), which is less sensitive than DNA sequence data. Multiple mitotypes of 'A' lineage honey bees have previously been observed in South America and Mexico using PCR-RFLP and DNA sequence analysis. Our findings are consistent with previous studies of AHB genetic variation from central Mexico, Columbia, and northern Brazil, in that the A1 mitotype was more common than the A4. Maximum parsimony analysis revealed that all of the 'A' lineage Apis mellifera mitotypes formed a distinct clade relative to representatives of the 'M', 'C', and 'O' lineages. Statistical analysis of the mitotype frequencies in the USA revealed an excess of low frequency mitotypes, indicating that the population size is expanding. The amount of genetic variation observed in Africanized honey bees in the USA therefore supports the idea that there have been multiple introductions of AHB into the country. © 2010 IBRA.","Africanized honey bee; Apis mellifera; COI-COII intergenic region; mtDNA; USA",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955954497

No significant differences were observed between the proportions of bees becoming infected after mites were exposed to injected pupae for five or ten days regardless the type of virus (DWV or SPV). There was a significant difference in the proportion of bees subsequently infected in relation to the time of year at which the experiments were undertaken. For both DWV and SPV, a greater proportion of adult bees became infected by the mites during September trials than during July trials. Significantly more adult bees were infected with DWV in comparison with SPV.

Proboscis extension response conditioning is a case of appetitive learning, in which harnessed bees learn to associate odor stimuli with sucrose reward in the laboratory. Despite its recurrent use as a tool for uncovering the behavioral, cellular, and molecular bases underlying associative learning, the question of whether social signals (pheromones) affect appetitive learning has not been addressed in this experimental framework. This situation contrasts with reports underlining that foraging activity of bees is modulated by alarm pheromones released in the presence of a potential danger. Here, we show that appetitive learning is impaired by the sting alarm pheromone (SAP) which, when released by guards, recruits foragers to defend the hive. This effect is mimicked by the main component of SAP, isopentyl acetate, is dose-dependent and lasts up to 24 h. Learning impairment is specific to alarm signal exposure and is independent of the odorant used for conditioning. Our results suggest that learning impairment may be a response to the biological significance of SAP as an alarm signal, which would detract bees from responding to any appetitive stimuli in a situation in which such responses would be of secondary importance. © 2010 Urlacher, Francés, Giurfa and Devaud.","Alarm; Honeybee; Insect; Learning; Modulation; Olfactory; Pheromone; Stress",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875941724

This study investigated the potential relationship between V. destructor, CWV and honey bees in 29 naturally infested colonies in the UK. We found that CWV was detected in less than half of the colonies, despite all having been infested by V. destructor. In contrast to several other viruses, we also found no evidence that V. destructor is able to vector CWV when feeding, and conclude that if transmitted by the mite, the virus fails to become established as an overt infection in the honey bee. The reasons why CWV has apparently increased in incidence in the UK since the arrival of V. destructor therefore remain unclear. © IBRA 2010.","Apis mellifera; Cloudy wing virus; Varroa destructor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953830538

Cultivation of the plant in Ghana has reduced over the last two decades, so it now mostly grows in the wild. A survey was conducted in coastal Ghana to provide baseline information about pollinators of the plant, to inform decisions on the conservation of it and its pollinators. Apis mellifera, three species of Xylocopa and two of Amegilla were identified among the flower visitors as likely pollinators. Preliminary measures of the efficiency of these visitors as pollinators were made and the relationship between visitor behaviour and the phenology of the plant was studied. Flowers were open for about 10 h, and over 80% of female flowers received pollen within the first 3 h of opening. Out of 120 female flowers observed, A. mellifera visited 49.2%, Xylocopa spp visited 35.8% and Amegilla spp visited 15%. Xylocopa spp visited flowers early in the day, were most active during the period that most flowers received pollen, and deposited pollen on stigmas of all female flowers they visited. Whilst a single visit by Xylocopa spp or Amegilla spp. could leave enough pollen for fertilization and fruit formation, multiple visits by A. mellifera might be required for successful pollination to occur. These results suggest that Xylocopa and Amegilla are more efficient pollinators of L. aegyptiaca than A. mellifera. The importance of these findings for the conservation of the plant and its associated insect species are discussed © 2010 IBRA.","Amegilla; Pollination; Pollinators; Xylocopa",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955934380

The brood may, however, also be subjected to suboptimal temperature. Here we investigated whether a decrease of brood rearing temperature may have effects on larval mortality, adult emergence, longevity, morphology and susceptibility to poisoning by pesticides (dimethoate). Using the in vitro rearing protocol of Aupinel (2005), we were able for the first time to control the brood temperature not only during the pupal stage but also during the larval stage. Honey bee larvae were reared in vitro at 35°C (optimal) and 33°C (suboptimal) from 12 h after hatching for 15 days. Dimethoate was tested by ingestion either on 4-day old larvae or on 7-day old adults. Our results showed that lower rearing temperature had no significant effects on larval mortality and adult emergence, but adult bee mortality was strongly affected. Moreover, adult workers emerging at 33°C were significantly more susceptible to dimethoate. Larval LD50 (48 h) was, however, 28 times higher at 33°C than at 35°C. The striking differences between larvae and adults may be explained by differential larval metabolism at 33°C and resulting slower active ingredient absorption. We conclude that adult honey bees reared at even slightly suboptimal brood temperature may be more susceptible to pesticide poisoning and be characterised by reduced longevity. Thus, low temperature brood rearing could be another stress factor for colonies. © IBRA 2010.","Bee losses; Brood temperature; CCD; Development; Longevity; Malformations; Mortality; Pesticide toxicity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952764734

We found consistent declines in colony numbers in central European countries and some increases in Mediterranean countries. Beekeeper numbers have declined in all of the European countries examined. Our data support the view that honey bees are in decline at least in some regions, which is probably closely linked to the decreasing number of beekeepers. Our data on colony numbers and beekeepers must, however, be interpreted with caution due to different approaches and socioeconomic factors in the various countries, thereby limiting their comparability.

Requeening treatment effects were quite variable and not statistically different. Requeened colonies were, however, generally larger than those headed by older queens when the experiment was terminated on 14 August and these colonies were killed and counted.

The proportion of operations with the Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) symptom of ""no dead bees in the colony or apiary"" decreased in this period as compared to the previous years. The proportion of colonies dying from apparently manageable conditions, however, such as starvation or a weak condition in the fall increased as compared to previous surveys. © IBRA 2010.","Colony Collapse Disorder; Honey bee; Overwinter mortality; United States",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953815539

Five colonies were randomly selected in each of 24 apiaries (i.e. 120 colonies). Four thorough clinical visits were carried out each year. Results are presented on pathogen occurrence and on beekeeping conditions, with a special focus on the relationship with colony size and colony mortality. All winter and summer mortality rates remained below 10% over the three year period. The following diseases were regularly found in apiaries (classified in descending order of mean prevalence): chalkbrood, bald brood, presence of Nosema spp. spores, Varroa destructor, American and European foulbrood. Foulbrood and V. destructor infestation were the most severe conditions significantly positively related to mortality. Attention to disease prevention and early detection were critical points for colony survival in many apiaries. © IBRA 2010.","Apis mellifera; Colony health; Field survey; Mortality; Varroa destructor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955933632

Multiple factors have been considered in connection with increased winter losses. In addition to national programmes investigating possible causes for increased honey bee mortality, scientists collaborate at an international level on different aspects of bee health within the COLOSS network. Within this network, Working Group 4 explores aspects of genetic diversity in relation to the vitality and health of honey bee populations. In this paper, we briefly review the genetic diversity of honey bees in Europe, discuss the effects of beekeeping and selective breeding on honey bee populations under the aspect of genetic diversity and bee health, and review the current status of EU legislation with respect to protection of native bee populations. We introduce and discuss recent approaches in honey bee selective breeding to improve disease resistance by introducing traits related to colony vitality. Finally, we present the aims of WG4 within the COLOSS network and briefly introduce our experimental approach. © 2010 IBRA.","Apis mellifera; Breeding; Disease resistance; Environment; Genetic diversity; Honey bees; Vitality",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953868962

Western blots probed with anti-AccMRJP1 antibody demonstrated that recombinant AccMRJP1 and soluble protein of the Western honeybee RJ (AmSPRJ) contained immunoreactive MRJP1. The 57 kDa protein in AmSPRJ contained an N-terminal amino sequence of N-I-L-R-G-E, which is identical to that previously characterized in AmMRJP1. The molecular weight of recombinant AccMRJP1 was decreased from 57 to 48 kDa after deglycosylation, indicating that AccMRJP1 was glycosylated. The recombinant AccMRJP1 significantly stimulated Tn-5B-4 cell growth, similar to AmSPRJ and fetal bovine serum, and affected cell shape and adhesion to the substrate. © 2010 American Chemical Society.","AccMRJP1; Apis cerana cerana; Eukaryotic expression; Proliferation activity; Royal jelly",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956501263

However, few studies have investigated the relationship between protein nutrition and immunity in insects. Here, we tested in honeybees (Apis mellifera) whether dietary protein quantity (monofloral pollen) and diet diversity (polyfloral pollen) can shape baseline immunocompetence (IC) by measuring parameters of individual immunity (haemocyte concentration, fat body content and phenoloxidase activity) and glucose oxidase (GOX) activity, which enables bees to sterilize colony and brood food, as a parameter of social immunity. Protein feeding modified both individual and social IC but increases in dietary protein quantity did not enhance IC. However, diet diversity increased IC levels. In particular, polyfloral diets induced higher GOX activity compared with monofloral diets, including protein-richer diets.

Flight is achieved by the contraction of indirect flight muscles that produce changes in thoracic volume and, therefore, wing movement. The purpose of this work is to examine possible differences in muscle development that may be associated with the flying activity of individuals in a given life stage considering the behavioral and physiological differences among the stages and between the two species studied. Measurements of the muscle fibers obtained from light microscopy preparations of muscle were submitted to statistical analysis in order to detect the differences at a given time, or throughout the life of the individual. The results show that muscle morphology is similar in both species, but in A. mellifera the muscle fibers are thicker and more numerous than in S. postica. Differences in the fiber thickness according to life stage in all classes of individuals of both species were detected.

The parasitic mite Varroa destructor is considered the major pest of the European honey bee (Apis mellifera) and responsible for declines in honey bee populations worldwide. Exploiting the full potential of gene sequences becoming available for V. destructor requires adaptation of modern molecular biology approaches to this non-model organism. Using a mu-class glutathione S-transferase (VdGST-mu1) as a candidate gene we investigated the feasibility of gene knockdown in V. destructor by double-stranded RNA-interference (dsRNAi). Results. Intra-haemocoelic injection of dsRNA-VdGST-mu1 resulted in 97% reduction in VdGST-mu1 transcript levels 48 h post-injection compared to mites injected with a bolus of irrelevant dsRNA (LacZ). This gene suppression was maintained to, at least, 72 h. Total GST catalytic activity was reduced by 54% in VdGST-mu1 gene knockdown mites demonstrating the knockdown was effective at the translation step as well as the transcription steps. Although near total gene knockdown was achieved by intra-haemocoelic injection, only half of such treated mites survived this traumatic method of dsRNA administration and less invasive methods were assessed. V. destructor immersed overnight in 0.9% NaCl solution containing dsRNA exhibited excellent reduction in VdGST-mu1 transcript levels (87% compared to mites immersed in dsRNA-LacZ). Importantly, mites undergoing the immersion approach had greatly improved survival (75-80%) over 72 h, approaching that of mites not undergoing any treatment. Conclusions. Our findings on V. destructor are the first report of gene knockdown in any mite species and demonstrate that the small size of such organisms is not a major impediment to applying gene knockdown approaches to the study of such parasitic pests. The immersion in dsRNA solution method provides an easy, inexpensive, relatively high throughput method of gene silencing suitable for studies in V. destructor, other small mites and immature stages of ticks. © 2010 Campbell et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955534241

In this study, we examined the effects of a low temperature before the flowering stage on the natural out-crossing rate. The cotyledons of soybean cv. Aomarukun are green, but those of the F1 obtained by crossing with cultivars with yellow cotyledons are yellow. Therefore, this was used for judgment of crossing. The plants of Aomarukun were grown in a growth chamber at 8-15°C for 7 days before the flowering stage, and then they were placed adjacent to the pollen parent under field conditions and the out-crossing rate was investigated. As a result, the out-crossing rate was 0-0.18% in the control plants and 0.1-0.62% in the low temperature-treated plants, indicating that the low temperature before the flowering stage enhances the rate considerably. In addition, the effect of the setting of beehives of honey bee, which is one of the pollinators, was examined.

Their natural migration has selected for traits that increase fitness within geographical areas, but in parallel their domestication has selected for traits that enhance productivity and survival under local conditions. Elucidating the biochemical mechanisms of these local adaptive processes is a key goal of evolutionary biology. Proteomics provides tools unique among the major 'omics disciplines for identifying the mechanisms employed by an organism in adapting to environmental challenges. Results: Through proteome profiling of adult honey bee midgut from geographically dispersed, domesticated populations combined with multiple parallel statistical treatments, the data presented here suggest some of the major cellular processes involved in adapting to different climates. These findings provide insight into the molecular underpinnings that may confer an advantage to honey bee populations. Significantly, the major energy-producing pathways of the mitochondria, the organelle most closely involved in heat production, were consistently higher in bees that had adapted to colder climates. In opposition, up-regulation of protein metabolism capacity, from biosynthesis to degradation, had been selected for in bees from warmer climates. Conclusions: Overall, our results present a proteomic interpretation of expression polymorphisms between honey bee ecotypes and provide insight into molecular aspects of local adaptation or selection with consequences for honey bee management and breeding. The implications of our findings extend beyond apiculture as they underscore the need to consider the interdependence of animal populations and their agro-ecological context. © 2010 Parker et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956205483

Previous studies on eusocial insects have indicated that caste differentiation and behavior are underlain by differential gene expression. Although much is known about gene expression in the honey bee, Apis mellifera, termites remain relatively understudied in this regard. Therefore, our objective was to assemble an expressed sequence tag (EST) data base for the eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes, for future gene expression studies.Results: Soldier, worker, and alate caste and two larval cDNA libraries were constructed, and approximately 15,000 randomly chosen clones were sequenced to compile an EST data base. Putative gene functions were assigned based on a BLASTX Swissprot search. Categorical in silico expression patterns for each library were compared using the R-statistic. A significant proportion of the ESTs of each caste and life stages had no significant similarity to those in existing data bases. All cDNA libraries, including those of non-reproductive worker and soldier castes, contained sequences with putative reproductive functions. Genes that showed a potential expression bias among castes included a putative antibacterial humoral response and translation elongation protein in soldiers and a chemosensory protein in alates.Conclusions: We have expanded upon the available sequences for R. flavipes and utilized an in silico method to compare gene expression in different castes of an eusocial insect. The in silico analysis allowed us to identify several genes which may be differentially expressed and involved in caste differences.

The objective of the study was to identify major beekeeping challenges and opportunities. For this study 5 peasant associations (PAs) were selected. From each PA a group of 30 to 40 beekeeping farmers was used for implementation of different participatory rural appraisal (PRA) tools selected for data collection. The collected data were analyzed using simple descriptive statistics. Guizotia scabra, Hypoestes forskali, croton macrostachy are the major honeybee flora in the study area. In both districts, honey is harvested two times a year which varied in period of harvest between highland and lowland areas of the districts. The major honey flow season is November to December and the minor honey flow is from May to June. In both districts' highland areas, the major honey flow season is March to May that is mainly attributed to the flowering season of croton macrostachy and the minor honey flow season is November to December. Shortage of honeybee forage, shortage of honeybee colonies, agrochemical poisoning are the major beekeeping constraints in both districts. Moreover, availability of honeybee enemies (ants, honey badger, bee-eater birds, wax moth, spider and beetles) were reported. The preference ranking matrix indicated that farmers of both districts know little about transitional hives. Beekeeping is considered as one of income source for the beekeepers and it has the 3rd and 4th rank among the other income sources in Arsi Negelle and Shashemene districts respectively. Despite the different challenges encountered in this sub-sector, opportunities for beekeeping development in the areas still exist due to the presence of natural resources, high demand for hive products and development policy attention from the government as one of the strategies to reduce poverty.","Bee management; Constraints and opportunities; Honeybee colonies; Honeybee enemies; Honeybee forages",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955065885

Analysis of the physico-chemical properties was performed in the Chemistry Laboratory of the Universidade Anhangüera in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. The propolis produced from wild flora in the Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone region presented a balsamic aroma, malleable consistency and dark green color. Significant differences were observed in the production of propolis with the greatest average verified in November (94.9 g). The oxidation indices varied significantly, where the lowest was observed in November (8.1 s). The greatest concentrations ofphenolic compounds (8.6%) andflavanoids (2.5%) were observed in November, while the greatest concentration of wax (6.4%) was encountered in July. Production and physico-chemical characteristics of propolis are influenced by seasonality, but are not correlated with variations in temperature and precipitation.

It is produced in almost every country of the world and it is a very important energy food, used as an ingredient in hundreds of manufactured foods, mainly in cereal-based products, for sweetness, flavour, colour, caramelisation and viscosity. Sugars represent the largest portion of honey composition (95-99% of the honey solids). Fructose and glucose are the most abundant sugars in honey, but others are usually mentioned, namely, sucrose, maltose, melibiose and trehalose. Its composition depends highly on the types of flowers used by the bees as well as on regional and climate conditions. Adulteration of honey is possible, so its quality must be controlled analytically with the aim of guaranteeing that it has not been adulterated and of preventing consumers from commercial speculations. Detection of honey adulteration is difficult and depends on the composition of the honey or on the presence of a specific component in the adulterant, like HMF (5-hydroxymethylfurfuraldehyde). The presence of HMF in honey could be due to the partial decomposition of the endogenous or exogenous fructose or to the honey overheating. Therefore, the HMF content is essential to evaluate the quality of honey according to the current legislation. Both the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Alinorm 01/25, 2000) and the European Union (Directive 110/2001) established that its concentration in honey usually should not exceed 80 or 40 mg/kg, respectively. The present paper focuses on the determination of sugars (fructose and glucose) and HMF from different types of honey from Transylvania using UV-vis. spectrophotometry. The experimental results showed that some of investigated samples had high soluble solids, reducing sugars, but low moisture content and HMF indicating a good quality of the honey. In other samples, the too high HMF indicated their adulteration with invert sugar.","5-hydroxymethylfurfuraldehyde; Adulteration; Honey",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954965015

Observations were carried out in the second half of October and accompanied by experiments aimed at determining the mechanisms of honeybee defence. We confirmed that V. crabro represents a relatively mild predator for A. mellifera ligustica but it can have a considerable impact on already debilitated colonies. Hornet predatory strategy is to spot then swoop on returning foragers. Honeybee defence centres on forming packed aggregations of individuals near the hive opening, which probably deters the wasps from entering. Coordinated behaviour by the bees, which cling together in groups, can knock the approaching hornets down, which are then totally covered by the bees. This balling behaviour has the effect of over-heating the predator whose lethal thermal limit is about 44 C, although other factors, such as carbon dioxide emission and the release of venom by the honeybees, may also contribute to the death of the hornet. Comparing the differences and similarities of this behaviour with those observed in other species of Apis and Vespa reveals that these two species are an interesting model for the study of the evolutionary arms race. © 2010 Dipartimento di Biologia Evoluzionistica dell'Universitá, Firenze, Italia.","Apis mellifera; defence behaviour; honeybee; hornet; hot balling; Vespa crabro",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650081429

This treatment is known to initiate oogenesis in queens, reduce oogenesis in queenless workers and to change worker foraging preference. We then assessed changes in gene expression of genes suspected to be involved in either foraging behaviour or reproduction. We show that some genes change expression in the opposite direction between castes in response to treatment.

Unfortunately, beekeepers lack a standardized sampling plan to make informed treatment decisions. Based on data from 31 commercial apiaries, we developed sampling plans for use by beekeepers and researchers to estimate the density of mites in individual colonies or whole apiaries. Beekeepers can estimate a colony's mite density with chosen level of precision by dislodging mites from ≈300 adult bees taken from one brood box frame in the colony, and they can extrapolate to mite density on a colony's adults and pupae combined by doubling the number of mites on adults. For sampling whole apiaries, beekeepers can repeat the process in each of n = 8 colonies, regardless of apiary size. Researchers desiring greater precision can estimate mite density in an individual colony by examining three, 300-bee sample units. Extrapolation to density on adults and pupae may require independent estimates of numbers of adults, of pupae, and of their respective mite densities. Researchers can estimate apiary-level mite density by taking one 300-bee sample unit per colony, but should do so from a variable number of colonies, depending on apiary size. These practical sampling plans will allow beekeepers and researchers to quantify mite infestation levels and enhance understanding and management of V. destructor. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.","honey bee; parasitic mite; pest management",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955336328

The formation of cAMP is catalyzed by adenylyl cyclases. A variety of factors can modulate the properties of these enzymes and lead to dynamic changes of the intracellular cAMP concentration. Here we determined the tissue distribution of a recently cloned adenylyl cyclase (AmAC3) in honeybee brain. The protein is present in all neuropils. Intensive immunoreactivity was found in parts of the proto- and deutocerebrum and in the suboesophageal ganglion. Biochemical and pharmacological properties of AmAC3 and of native adenylyl cyclases in subregions of the honeybee brain were examined. Values for half-maximal activation with NKH477 were in the low micromolar range with 10.2 μM for AmAC3 and 3.6-8.1μM for native enzymes. Biosynthesis of cAMP was specifically blocked by P-site inhibitors. Adenylyl cyclases in antennal lobes and AmAC3 share the inhibitory profile with 2',5'dd3'ATP&gt;3'AMP&gt;2'deoxyadenosine. In addition to P-site inhibitors AmAC3 activity was impaired by Ca 2+/calmodulin.

Melipona, like Apis, possesses the remarkable ability to use representational communication to indicate the location of foraging patches. Although Melipona has been the subject of numerous behavioral, ecological, and genetic studies, the evolutionary history of this genus remains largely unexplored. Here, we implement a multigene phylogenetic approach based on nuclear, mitochondrial, and ribosomal loci, coupled with molecular clock methods, to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships and antiquity of subgenera and species of Melipona. Our phylogenetic analysis resolves the relationship among subgenera and tends to agree with morphology-based classification hypotheses. Our molecular clock analysis indicates that the genus Melipona shared a most recent common ancestor at least ∼14-17 million years (My) ago.

In this study we assessed whether the density of feral honeybees, hoverflies (probably 2 species) and native bees (multiple species) in temperate Australian Brassica oilseed crops was related to the composition of the landscape. The density of pollinators was measured at multiple points in six different Brassica oilseed paddocks (20-80. ha) at least 1.75. km apart. Landscape composition at multiple scales (radii 100-2000. m) was determined from GIS layers of Brassica paddocks, woody vegetation and non-woody vegetation, and a derived layer expected to reflect the condition of woody vegetation remnants (the 'Link' score). Densities of feral honeybees were higher near the edges of Brassica fields than towards the middle. Densities of feral honeybees were strongly positively associated with the summed 'Link' score within 300. m and with the amount of woody vegetation. Densities of native bees and hoverflies were not strongly associated with woody vegetation or with woody vegetation with a high 'Link' score. Our results suggest that maximising feral honeybee abundance within paddocks in these landscapes may require smaller paddocks than those typically used, interspersed with habitat beneficial to feral honeybees such as woody vegetation in good condition. © 2010 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","Apis; Bees; Canola; Ecosystem service; Habitat condition; Hoverflies; Syrphid",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955416931

Using the Honeybee Apis mellifera as a case study, and information derived from highly experienced commercial apiarists, we determined that 32 exotic plants are important pollen sources. Most species offered high to very high quality pollen. Pollen quality varied temporally, spatially and infraspecifically. Fifteen species were considered more beneficial to A. mellifera than others; only seven species were considered less beneficial. Thus, exotic flora contribute pollen resources that are valuable to maintain ecosystem function, particularly at times when flowering native species are few.","Ecosystem function; Exotic flora; Pollen; Pollinators; Weeds",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957311994

These developmentally regulated behavioural changes were previously shown to be correlated with genome-wide transcriptional changes in the honeybee brain. The indigenous small regulatory RNA molecules, known as microRNAs (miRNAs), are potent regulators of gene expression and also are developmentally regulated. Thus, we wanted to study if there might be correlation of differential expression of miRNA genes in the brain with age-dependent behavioural changes of the bees. We determined expression patterns of a set (n = 20) of predicted miRNA genes, by quantitative real-time PCR assays, in the brains of young and old bees that were engaged in nursing or foraging activities in the colony, respectively. Our data show correlated up-regulation of miRNA-124, miRNA-14, miRNA-276, miRNA-13b, let-7 and miRNA-13a in the young nurse bees. miRNA-12, miRNA-9, miRNA-219, miRNA-210, miRNA-263, miRNA-92 and miRNA-283 showed correlated expression patterns in the old forager bees.

To preserve a crop's varietal purity or to restrict ingress into conventional varieties of genetically modified (GM) genes, a quantitative understanding of gene flow is useful. Previous measurements of gene flow in safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.), a crop with GM varieties, were made in plots of less than 1. ha. Here, I evaluate a mathematical model of field-to-field gene flow due to insect pollination using parameter values appropriate to a large agricultural field of safflower. The model was solved based on laboratory pollination experiments and observations made on a large (40. ha) safflower field in Lethbridge, Canada that was pollinated by honey bees (Apis mellifera) and bumble bees (Bombus spp.). The model estimated the maximum feasible level of bee-mediated, field-to-field gene flow to range between 0.05% and 0.005% of seed set (95% upper confidence intervals of 0.23% and 0.023%), depending on the composition of the bee fauna. These relatively low values emerged for two reasons: safflower has a high capacity for automatic self-fertilization; and bees undertook long foraging bouts in the field, which made between-field pollinations relatively rare. A strategy for minimizing GM gene flow should utilize a conventional safflower variety that has a high capacity for automatic self-fertilization and should allow the conventional plants to grow in large stands to encourage long foraging bouts by bees. © 2010 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","Apis mellifera; Bombus; Bumble bees; Carthamus tinctorius; Cross-pollination; GM crops; Honey bees; PMF; Pollination",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955427719

We compared phenology, pollination biology, and breeding systems of wild and managed populations to determine whether humans have influenced changes in these aspects. Flower production was markedly higher in cultivated populations. Flowering peak of all managed populations occurred in December whereas in the wild it occurred in February. Anthesis was diurnal, with Plebeia mexicana being the most frequent flower visitor in the wild, Apis mellifera and Tabanus sp. in silvicultural populations, and Xylocopa mexicanorum in cultivated populations. Natural pollination was more successful in cultivated than in wild and silvicultural populations (83.3%, 40%, 26.66% fruits, respectively). Out-crossing was the most successful breeding system in all populations. Self-pollination was higher in cultivated (23.3% successful fruits) than in other populations (3.3% successful fruits in wild, and 10.0% in silviculture populations). Differences in flower production influenced by artificial selection and pollinator type explain different fruit production in managed and wild populations, whereas environmental heterogeneity influences differences in reproductive patterns, limiting pollen flow and contributing to maintaining phenotypic divergence among populations of M. schenckii. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The transfer of this knowledge to weed control management has not been fully explored. In part, this may be because it is difficult to quantify the economic impact of environmental weeds. This diminishes the prospects for expensive research and development required for integrated weed management. In this study, we examine the reproductive ecology of Phyla canescens, a species native to South America that is an aggressive agricultural and environmental weed in many parts of the world. We found that P. canescens is self-compatible, but not capable of automatic self-pollination. A vector is required to effect seed set. Field studies showed that 45% of seeds produced through open pollination are viable. Using exclosure cages, we showed that non-native Apis mellifera L. (honeybee) was the primary floral visitor and pollinator. Honeybee abundance was positively correlated with P. canescens abundance. Within the study site of 0.51 ha, almost 500 000 seeds ha-1 would be produced annually, as a result of honeybee pollination. This study shows that a shared evolutionary history is not required for honeybees to be successful pollinators.

Such multispecies interactions can give rise to trait-mediated indirect effects that are likely to be common in nature but which are also inherently difficult to predict. Understanding multispecies interactions is also important in the use of biological control agents to control invasive plants because modern approaches to biocontrol rely on releasing multiple agents for each target weed. Centaurea solstitialis is one of the most problematic invasive weeds in California, USA, and the weevil Eustenopus villosus is its dominant biological control agent. We conducted a field experiment to quantitatively assess the direct effect of the recently approved biocontrol pathogen Puccinia jaceae f.s. solstitialis on plant performance and any indirect effects that might arise by altering the plant's interactions with Eustenopus or its pollinators (principally the nonnative Apis mellifera). We documented both synergy and interference between the two biocontrol agents depending on the life stage of the weevil. Puccinia infection increased the impact of bud-feeding by the adult weevils but reduced the impact of seed-feeding by larval weevils. Neither infection nor Eustenopus attack had an effect on pollinator visitation. The net effect was that attack by both the pathogen and the weevil did not reduce plant fitness relative to plants attacked only by the weevil. Because the consequence to the plant of interacting with one species may depend on the presence or absence of other interacting species, a careful consideration of multispecies interactions may be necessary for the selection of biocontrol agents that act in a complementary manner to reduce plant fitness. Likewise, relatively tractable weed-biocontrol systems allow us to examine multispecies interactions that can be difficult to study experimentally in native systems that are composed of numerous species with well-established populations. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Biological control; California, USA; Centaurea solstitialis; Cumulative stress; Eustenopus villosus; Indirect interactions; Interference; Puccinia jaceae f.s. solstitialis; Synergy; Yellow starthistle",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955455079

We combined these assessments to calculate the contribution of bees to crop production in this system. Wild bees were the dominant pollinators in small fields, comprising 58% of flower-visiting bees, whereas 97% of bees in large fields were honey bees. Large fields had four times as many bees visiting flowers than small fields, but only one-tenth as many bumble bees as small fields. Levels of fruit set exceeded 85% in all fields and were similar between field sizes. Berry weight increased with flower exposure to pollinators and was positively correlated with bee abundance. Berry weights from open-pollinated flowers were twice as high in large fields compared with small fields. By combining berry weight increases attributable to honey bees and wild bees in blueberry fields with measurements of the bee community adjusted for pollinator efficiency, we calculated the relative contributions of honey bees and wild bees to pollination of Michigan blueberries. We estimate that wild bees provide 82% of the pollination in small fields but only 12% of the total pollination services across this system, mostly through their secondary role in large fields. Synthesis and applications. Wild bees are the primary pollinators of small blueberry fields, but these insects are at low abundance in large fields, perhaps due to a lack of nesting resources or competition for resources with honey bees. Our findings highlight the dependence of commercial fruit producers on honey bees and suggest that increasing the pollination contribution of other bees, particularly bumble bees, in large fields will require that growers adopt wild bee conservation strategies or stock their fields with managed colonies. Quantifying the contributions of managed and wild pollinating bees across the range of crop production scenarios will help to direct development of integrated crop pollination strategies to minimize the risk of pollination deficits affecting food production. © 2010 The Authors.

Recently, head glands that closely resemble the PPG of ants were discovered in females of a solitary digger wasp, the European beewolf. The function of this gland necessarily differs from ants: beewolf females apply the secretion of their PPG onto the bodies of paralysed honeybees that serve as larval provisions in order to delay fungus growth. Since ants and digger wasps are not closely related, the occurrence of this gland in these two taxa might either be due to convergent evolution or it is a homologous organ inherited from a common ancestor. Here we test the hypothesis that the PPGs of both taxa are homologous by comparing characteristics of chemical composition and physiology of the PPG of beewolves and ants. Based on reported characteristics of the PPG content of ants, we tested three predictions that were all met. First, the PPG of beewolves contained mainly long-chain hydrocarbons and very few compounds with functional groups. Second, the composition of hydrocarbons in the beewolf PPG was similar to that of the hemolymph. Taking the structure of the gland epithelium and the huge requirements of beewolf females for gland secretion into account this result suggests that the content of the PPG is also sequestered from the hemolymph in beewolves. Third, the chemical composition of the PPG and the cuticle was similar in beewolves since cuticular hydrocarbons derive either from the hemolymph or the PPG. Taking the considerable morphological similarities into account, our results support the hypothesis of a homologous origin of the PPG in beewolves and ants. © The Author(s) 2010.","European beewolf; Hydrocarbons; Philanthus triangulum; Postpharyngeal gland",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953869564

Indirect approaches such as PCR-based and isotopic analyses clarify patterns of resource consumption but fail to distinguish predation from scavenging. Given that facultative scavenging is a ubiquitous and phylogenetically widespread foraging strategy, an improved ability to discriminate prey from carrion is needed to enhance an understanding of the demographic effects of consumption and the true nature of trophic interactions. Using physiological properties of muscle tissue - specifically pH and rate of water loss - we develop a novel method to discriminate prey from carrion collected by scavenging hymenopteran predators. Our focal system is the western yellowjacket (Vespula pensylvanica), a common scavenging predator in Hawaii and western North America. Prior to consumption, the physical properties of hymenopteran muscle tissue change in a quantifiable and deterministic manner post mortem and can be used to estimate the time and putative cause of death of diet items. Applying this method in laboratory and field situations resulted in the correct identification of prey and carrion in 49 out of 56 cases (88%). Although further investigation is needed to determine how post-mortem physiology of diet items changes in the guts of consumers, the approaches developed in this study can be used to distinguish predation from scavenging by central-place foragers (particularly arthropods). Such information will provide a more definitive characterization of species interactions and food webs. © 2010.

Here, we address this question by tracing the flight paths of individual bees with a harmonic radar system. Bees were trained along an array of three landmarks (tents), and the distance between these landmarks was either increased or decreased under two test conditions. We find that absolute distance estimation dominates the search for the feeding place, but serial position effects are also found.

The apiculture industry plays an important role in generating employment and in . increasing family income in the rural areas of the world. Honey production is the foremost purpose of beekeeping and it brings the greatest profit to this industry. The essential and valuable activities of bees depend upon beekeepers maintaining a healthy population of honey bees, because like other insects and livestock, honey bees are subject to many diseases and pests. Many developing countries are trying to improve the quality of their honey products but they frequently encounter the main obstacle in apiculture; control of diseases and pests of honey bees. The use of pesticides has become inevitable in the present day agriculture. These chemicals used on the crops for the pest control have some side effects, one of which is their toxicity to honey bees. Honey bees are susceptible to many pesticides, especially insecticides. The pesticidal poisoning of honey bees invariably causes a heavy mortality of bees which results in the loss to both the beekeeper and the farmer.","Apiculture; Bee flora; Honey; Honey bees; Pesticide poisoning",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650657578

The 40-43 kDa and the 70-90 kDa AGP production is peaked 1-3 h post-LPS treatment. We observed that the responses to LPS and FCA are similar in that both AGP isoforms are induced whereas they differ in that the FCA exhibits a 6 h lag period. The response to HgCl2, however, exhibits the specific biphasic induction only of the 40-43 kDa AGP. The serum 40-43 kDa AGP glycoform gradually increases in response to all of the above stimulants and peaks by 24 h post- treatment. The increase of the 70-90 kDa AGP levels in the air pouch occurs in association with the accumulation of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells while dexamethasone (DEX) increases only the 40-43 kDa AGP production in the absence of PMN accumulation. Macrophage-monocyte lineage cells forming the air pouch lining tissue may potentially be the cells that secrete the 40-43 kDa AGP while polymorphonuclear cells that infiltrate the air pouch secrete the 70-90 kDa AGP. The 40-43 kDa and 70-90 kDa AGP production induced by LPS in the air pouch precedes that of interleukin-1 (IL-1) or interleukin-6 (IL-6) while the 40-43 kDa AGP glycoform potentially increases IL-6 production by air pouch PMN exudate cells. These significant differences suggest a local pro-inflammatory role of AGP. Honeybee venom suppressed arthritis development and exhibited differential local or systemic regulation of AGP in serum vs. air pouch exudate or synovial fluid. This study with the air pouch model of facsimile synovium tissue suggests that local α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) production may contribute to pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory activities during the local acute phase response or during chronic inflammatory stress as in arthritis. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","α1-Acid glycoprotein; Adjuvant arthritis; Air pouch; Cytokines; Inflammation; Synovial fluid",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954033988

However, it remains unclear whether these findings reflect a global crisis for crop pollination. Understanding the extent to which world agriculture is endangered by pollinator decline is essential if the economic valuation of nature is to be used to promote conservation. We assess the susceptibility to pollinator limitation of one of the most important tropical and subtropical fruit crops, mango Mangifera indica L., commonly planted in a region of South Africa located between two large biodiversity-rich protected natural areas. We conducted flower visitor surveys, exclusion experiments and spatial analysis of flower visitation and fruit production patterns.3. Our results show that both ants and flower visitors were effective pollinators of mango, the latter significantly declining (in abundance and species richness) with distance to natural habitat while ants were not affected. Neither the absence of pesticides nor the supplementation of flower visitors by using managed honeybees served to offset these negative impacts. Food-web data suggest that maintaining diversity of flower resources within farmland can help maintain pollinator communities. Moreover, models based exclusively on pollinator abundance underestimated the negative effect of distance from natural habitat on production (42% less at 500 m from natural habitat). As soil nutrient levels and water content are regularly measured and corrected in all study sites, these results suggest that pollinator diversity may also be important. Synthesis and applications. This study provides one of the first examples of marked pollination limitation in farms surrounded by well-protected natural habitat. For mango farming to be sustainable, it is essential to limit contiguous growth of farmland and consider practices that restore the complexity of plant-pollinator networks within farms, for example through the creation and maintenance of pollinator-friendly areas.

From May to July, pollengathering bees visited mainly rose species from 8:00 to 12:00 in the morning. The bees preferentially visited the rose species (R. rugosa, R. hirtula, R. bracteata and R. luciae), over the cultivated roses (R. Easy Going, R. Princess of Wales, R. L Aimant and R. WGS), probably due to the higher quantity of pollen produced and greater accessibility by the single-petaled wild species as compared to the double-petaled cultivated roses. Therefore, it seemed that cross-hybridization of rose species by the pollen of the cultivated roses is low under natural conditions. However, gene flow from R. Lavande to R. spp. was possible given the high rate of honeybee visitation on R. LavandeOn the other hand, in October, flies were observed on both wild roses (R.rugosa) and cultivated roses. However, the contribution of pollination between wild and cultivated roses by the flies seemed to be low due to their lower pollen carrying ability.","Insect observations; Pollination; Pollinators; R. hybrida; R. spp",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957110044

Yet, at a time when the ""pollination crisis"" is of major concern as natural populations of both wild and honey bees (Apis mellifera L., 1758) face alarming decline rates at a worldwide scale, there are important gaps in our understanding of the ecology and evolution of bee-flower interactions. In this review, we summarize and discuss the current knowledge about the role of floral chemistry versus other communication channels in bee-pollinated flowering plants, both at the macro- and micro-evolutionary levels, and across the specialization-generalization gradient. The available data illustrate that floral scents and floral chemistry have been largely overlooked in bee-flower interactions, and that pollination studies integrating these components along with pollinator behaviour in a phylogenetic context will help gain considerable insights into the sensory ecology and the evolution of bees and their associated flowering plants.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952552734

Thus, awareness of the situation of consumption nodes, by considering water pressures and the amount of water that is being supplied, could be an effective source of information for designing high performance WDNs. In this paper, Two-loop and Hanoi networks are selected for least-cost design, considering water pressures and the amount of water supplied on each consumption node under breakage level one, using the honey-bee mating optimization (HBMO) algorithm. In each state of design, a specific pressure is defined as the minimum expected pressure under breakage level one which holds the pressure reliability in the considered range. Also, variations of some criteria such as reliabilities of pressure and demand, vulnerability of the network, and flexibility of the design are analyzed as a tool for choosing the appropriate state of design. Results show that a minor increase in the cost of design could lead to a considerable improvement in reliabilities of pressure and demand under breakage level one. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Breakage level one; Design; Honey-bee mating optimization (HBMO) algorithm; Performance criteria; Water distribution networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650310372

We examined brain gene expression profiles of the primitively eusocial wasp Polistes metricus and compared the results with a growing base of brain gene expression information for the advanced eusocial honeybee, Apis mellifera. We studied four female wasp groups that show variation in foraging/provisioning behaviour and reproductive status, using our newly developed microarray representing approximately 3248 E metricus genes based on sequences generated from high-throughput pyrosequencing. We found differences in the expression of approximately 389 genes across the four groups. Pathways known from Drosophila melanogaster to be related to lipid metabolism, heat and stress response, and various forms of solitary behaviour were associated with behavioural differences among wasps. Fortyfive per cent of differentially expressed transcripts showed significant associations with foraging/provisioning status, and 14 per cent with reproductive status. By comparing these two gene lists with lists of genes previously shown to be differentially expressed in association with honeybee division of labour, we found a significant overlap of genes associated with foraging/provisioning, but not reproduction, across the two species. These results suggest common molecular roots for foraging division of labour in two independently evolved social insect species and the possibility of more lineage-specific roots of reproductive behaviour. We explore the implications of these findings for the idea that there is a conserved 'genetic toolkit' for division of labour across multiple lineages. © 2010 The Royal Society.","Division of labour; Foraging behaviour; Gene expression; Honeybee; Microarray; Paper wasp",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955389048

Hexane and ethyl and methanol acetate extracts from each plant as well as propolis hexane and ethanol extracts were tested on 2 gram-positive and 8 gram-negative bacterial strains: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella tiphy, Yersinia enterocolitica, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans (Pantoea agglomerans), Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae Nr. 01 and V. cholerae (clinical case). The propolis extracts was analyzed by HPLC chromatography. Propolis extracts were active against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Vibrio cholerae Nr. 01 and V. cholerae (clinical case). Callistemon citrinus Stapf extracts were effective against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Vibrio cholerae Nr. 01 and V. cholerae (clinical case), Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnhardt extracts acted against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Vibrio cholerae Nr. 01 and Ricinus communis L extracts were effective against V. cholerae (clinical case), Shigella dysenteriae and E. agglomerans. In general, antimicrobial activity of propolis coincided with plant extract activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Vibrio cholerae Nr. 01 and V. cholerae (clinical case). The major compounds were the flavones, cinnamic acid derivative and the caffeic acid derivative. These data corroborate the close relationship between propolis composition and the constitution of plants serving as source for some of its components. Thus, the antibacterial spectrum of propolis will vary depending on the geographical situation and the types of vegetation of a given region. On the other hand, plants used by Apis mellifera to produce propolis are being considered as source of secondary metabolites with antimicrobial action. © Medwell Journals, 2010.","Antibacterial properties; Apis mellifera; Beehives; Floral extracts; Mexican plant extracts; Propolis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954633623

This protocol is useful to determine whether or not animals ""learn to learn"" and solve successive discriminations faster (or with fewer errors) with increasing reversal experience. Here we used the olfactory conditioning of proboscis extension reflex to study how honeybees Apis mellifera perform in a multiple reversal task. Our experiment contemplated four consecutive differential conditioning phases involving the same odors (A+ vs. B- to A- vs. B+ to A+ vs. B- to A- vs. B+). We show that bees in which the weight of reinforced or non-reinforced stimuli was similar mastered the multiple olfactory reversals. Bees which failed the task exhibited asymmetric responses to reinforced and non-reinforced stimuli, thus being unable to rapidly reverse stimulus contingencies. Efficient reversers did not improve their successive discriminations but rather tended to generalize their choice to both odors at the end of conditioning. As a consequence, both discrimination and reversal efficiency decreased along experimental phases. This result invalidates a learning-to-learn effect and indicates that bees do not only respond to the actual stimulus contingencies but rather combine these with an average of past experiences with the same stimuli. © 2010 Mota and Giurfa.","Honeybee; Learning; Multiple reversal; Olfaction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867642278

In the field we studied color learning at a food site and at the hive entrance. In the laboratory olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response (PER) was examined. In the color learning protocol at a feeder, bees with low sucrose acceptance thresholds (≤3%) show significantly faster and better acquisition than bees with high thresholds (≥50%). Retention after 24 h is significantly different between the two groups of bees and the choice reactions converge. Bees with low and high acceptance thresholds in the field show no differences in the sucrose sensitivity PER tests in the laboratory. Acceptance thresholds in the field are thus a more sensitive behavioral measure than PER responsiveness in the laboratory. Bees with low acceptance thresholds show significantly better acquisition and 24-h retention in olfactory learning in the laboratory compared to bees with high thresholds. In the learning protocol at the hive entrance bees learn without sucrose reward that a color cue signals an open entrance. In this experiment, bees with high sucrose acceptance thresholds showed significantly better learning and reversal learning than bees with low thresholds.

However, it is unknown if workers are able to lay in queen cells immediately after queen loss during an episode of emergency queen rearing. In this study we experimentally de-queened colonies and determined the maternity of larvae and pupae that were reared as queens. This allowed us to determine how soon after queen loss workers contribute to the production of new queens. We were further interested to see if workers would preferentially raise new queens from queen-laid brood if this was introduced later. We performed our manipulations in two different settings: an apiary setting where colonies were situated close together and a more natural situation in which the colonies were well separated. This allowed us to determine how the vicinity of other colonies affects the presence of parasites. We found that workers do indeed contribute to queen cell production immediately after the loss of their queen, thus demonstrating that some workers either have activated ovaries even when their colony has a queen or are able to activate their ovaries extremely rapidly. Queen-laid brood introduced days after queen loss was ignored, showing that workers do not prefer to raise new queens from queen brood when given a choice. We also detected non-natal parasitism of queen cells in both settings. We therefore conclude that some A. m. capensis genotypes specialize in parasitizing queen cells. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","apiary; Apis mellifera capensis; non-natal parasitism; queen cell",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954248072

To investigate proteins/molecules related to the sociality of the European honeybee (Apis mellifera L.), we performed a proteomic analysis of the honeybee salivary system. The honeybee salivary system comprises two secretory glands: the postcerebral gland (PcG) and the thoracic gland (TG), both of which are connected to a common duct that opens in the mouthpart. Although most (31 out of 35) of the major proteins identified from the PcG and TG were housekeeping proteins, the spot intensities for aldolase and acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 2 were stronger in the PcG than in the TG in the 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting confirmed that the expression of these proteins was stronger in the PcG than in the TG, whereas expression was almost not detectable in the hypopharyngeal gland (HpG), suggesting that carbohydrate metabolism is enhanced in the honeybee PcG. In addition, imaginal disc growth factor 4 (IDGF4) was synthesized in the honeybee salivary system. Immunoblotting indicated IDGF4 expression was very strong in the PcG, moderate in the TG, and very weak in the HpG. A considerable amount of IDGF4 was detected in the royal jelly, while less was detected in honey, strongly suggesting that the honeybee salivary system secretes IDGF4 into the royal jelly and honey. The secreted IDGF4 might therefore affect growth and physiology of the other colony members. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Honeybee; Housekeeping enzyme; Imaginal disc growth factor; Proteomics; Salivary gland",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954384966

Presently, Nosema ceranae seems to be the main microsporidian infection in Apis mellifera. The antibiotic fumagillin is the only compound available to treat Nosema diseases; however, it is no longer licensed in most EU member states; therefore, the need to identify new molecules/substances prevails. The intent of this paper is to test bacterial metabolites by Bacillus and Enterococcus strains, isolated from bee midgut and honey. The toxicity on bees and the antiparasitic activity on N. ceranae were assessed under laboratory conditions. Results did not yield toxicity for the administered surfactin or bacteriocin concentrations. Spores exposed to direct contact with a particular surfactin revealed a significant infectivity reduction when inoculated on bees. This surfactin, administered ad libitum from the individuals' emergence, led to a significant reduction in parasitosis development when bees were infected with untreated spores 7 days postemergence. Based on the results obtained, one of the surfactins is herein postulated as a molecule capable of reducing N. ceranae development, acting either by direct exposure to purified spores or incorporated into the digestive tract of the bee. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955471441

Most of the colonies were infested with varroa mites during the fall (75.7%), but only 27.9% and 6.1% tested positive to nosema disease and tracheal mites, respectively. Winter colony mortality was 27.2%, and when examined as a fraction of all morbidity factors, fall varroa mite infestations were the leading cause of colony mortality (associated to > 85% of colony deaths), followed by fall bee populations and food reserves. Varroa-infested colonies, with weak populations and low food reserves in the fall, significantly decreased spring colony populations, whereas varroa infestations and Nosema infections in the spring, significantly decreased bee populations by early summer. Overall, results suggest that varroa mites could be the main culprit for the death and reduced populations of overwintered honey bee colonies in northern climates. © INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences, 2010.","bee populations; CCD; Ontario; Varroa destructor; winter colony mortality",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952891138

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between stratification and synaptogenesis in the developing mushroom bodies of the honeybee. During metamorphosis, the vertical lobe of mushroom body shows progressive stratification with three thick primary strata and more secondary strata and laminae. Three primary strata are formed at the metamorphic stage P1, before the youngest generation of the mushroom body intrinsic neurons, Kenyon cells, is produced. Thus, the primary strata within the lobe are unlikely to represent three major subpopulations of the Kenyon cells sequentially produced in the mushroom bodies. Formation of laminae starts at the stage P2 and culminates at the end of metamorphosis. The laminae appear within the lobe rather than being added sequentially from the ingrowth stratum. Alternating dark and light lamina (lamina doublets) are formed in the vertical lobe in late metamorphosis (stages P6-P9), but they are not visible in adults. The pattern of stratification is not continuous along the vertical lobe at the same developmental stage, and resorting of axons of the Kenyon cells is likely to occur within dark laminae. In the developing vertical lobe, dark laminae show lower synaptic density and exhibit an ultra structure that is indicative for a delay in synaptogenesis relative to the primary strata.

This behaviour consists of the capacity of the bee to detect, bite and eliminate parasites in the phoretic stage. In this investigation we evaluated the presence of grooming behavior in bee colonies through observations of damaged mites. For this we used six colonies of A. mellifera in Langstroth type beehives, which were evaluated daily for 30 days in April and May of 2008. The samples consisted of daily mite fall onto metal sheets coated with vaseline, placed in the floor of each beehive for a period of 24 hours. The results showed 95% of fallen mites dead and 5% alive out of a total of 2005 mites. We found 49% of mites with damage and 51% without damage. Based on these observations, it may be possible to choose colonies with significant grooming behavior such as dorsal damage and complete damage, which can be very useful to study bee selection and to design strategies of integrated management of the mite V. destructor.","Apis mellifera; Mite; V. destructor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960533704

During 1999 and 2000, two insect species previously unreported from Illinois were observed visiting its flowers. This study was undertaken to survey additional insect visitors, as well as to characterize the plant community where S. pickeringii occurs. The objectives were to survey: 1) floral traits (anthesis and flower density) of S. pickeringii, 2) associated plant species, and 3) insect visitor characteristics. Floral traits were determined and associated plant species surveyed in Mason County (degraded hay field on private property) and Henderson County (dry sand prairie at the Big River State Forest), Illinois. Insects visiting flowers were collected at 10:00 a.m., 12:30 p.m., and 3:00 p.m. during June, July, and August in 2001 and 2002. Individual flowers lasted one day and remained open for 68 hours. Peak flowering occurred from early to the middle of July when S. pickeringii was the dominant species in flower. Henderson County contained a greater diversity of native plant species with less bare ground and fewer non-native species than the Mason County site. Forty-seven insect species were observed visiting S. pickeringii flowers. Most frequent visitors were Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae), Bombylius fraudulentus (Diptera: Bombyliidae), and Heterostylum croceum (Diptera: Bombliidae). The diversity of visiting insects was higher earlier than later in the day, in July and August than June, and in Henderson than Mason County. © 2010 New England Botanical Club.","dry sand prairie; endangered plant species; Heterostylum; Illinois plants; Patterson bindweed; Stylisma",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78249235629

In an attempt to study the involvement of CRT in innate immunity, the full-length cDNA of calreticulin (PxCRT) was cloned from the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. It consists of 1674 bp (excluding poly-A tail) with a longest open reading frame (ORF) of 1197 bp encoding 398 amino acids. In silico analysis of PxCRT ORF reveals that it has various repeat motifs and endoplasmic reticulum retention signal found in all the calreticulin proteins. As expected, high amino acid sequence identities were found from other CRTs identified from Bombyx mori (87%), Galleria mellonella (87%), Apis mellifera (74%), Anopheles gambiae (74%), Tribolium castaneum (73%), Culex quinquefasciatus (73%), Rhodnius prolixus (72%), Nasonia vitripennis (71%), Drosophila melanogaster (71%) and Haemaphysalis qinghaiensis (68%). During development, P. xylostella expressed PxCRT predominantly in the pupal stage. In addition, spatial expression pattern analysis indicates that PxCRT was highly expressed in the silk gland. PxCRT mRNA, furthermore, was strongly induced 3 to 6 h after laminarin treatment, suggesting that PxCRT appears to be involved in immune responses and also plays an important role in the silk gland. © 2010 The Authors.

We examined genetic variation in adult beetle samples from the United States, Australia, Canada, and Africa by sequencing a 912-base pair region of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene and screening 10 informative microsatellite loci. One Canadian introduction of small hive beetles can be traced to Australia, whereas the second introduction seems to have come from the United States. Beetles now resident in Australia were of a different African origin than were beetles in North America. North American beetles did not show covariance between two mitochondrial haplotypes and their microsatellite frequencies, suggesting that these beetles have a shared source despite having initial genetic structure within their introduced range. Excellent dispersal of beetles, aided in some cases by migratory beekeeping and the bee trade, seems to lead to panmixis in the introduced populations as well as in Africa. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.","Aethina tumida; Apis mellifera; DNA barcode; Invasive species; pollination",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954253045

The consecutive comb reutilization might transfer pigments to honey that, in turn, can alter honey final characteristics. In the present study the objective was to evaluate the influence of comb reutilization on honey physico-chemical and color characteristics. The experiment was carried out using randomized blocks with four treatments and six repetitions. Each hive was considered a block. The treatments consisted of boxes with sheet of alveolated wax and honeycomb with one, two or three years of usage, totaling 24 boxes. Honey samples were analyzed by diffuse reflectance spectrophotometry and the physico-chemical properties were analyzed by laboratory standard tests. The diffuse reflectance, total sugar, pH, acidity and ash did not varied significantly among treatments (p > 0.05).

Most individuals evolve by kin selection and forgo individual reproduction. Instead, they display altruistic food sharing, nest maintenance and self-sacrificial colony defence. Recently, altruistic self-removal of diseased worker ants from their colony was described as another important kin-selected behaviour. Here, we report corroborating experimental evidence from honey bee foragers and theoretical analyses. We challenged honey bee foragers with prolonged CO2 narcosis or by feeding with the cytostatic drug hydroxyurea. Both treatments resulted in increased mortality but also caused the surviving foragers to abandon their social function and remove themselves from their colony, resulting in altruistic suicide. A simple model suggests that altruistic self-removal by sick social insect workers to prevent disease transmission is expected under most biologically plausible conditions. The combined theoretical and empirical support for altruistic self-removal suggests that it may be another important kin-selected behaviour and a potentially widespread mechanism of social immunity. © 2010 The Authors.

Fipronil, imidacloprid and thiametoxam are systemic or systemic-like insecticides widely used in maize crops. Their heavy action in the nervous system of target insects also means a high toxicity to non-target pollinator insects such as honey bees which can get in touch with them through pollen and nectar during foraging activities. These insecticides have even been suspected to cause a significant decrease of honeybee colonies that has been observed in many countries since the past decade. Since September 1st 2008, the European Commission set new MRLs in food and feed of plant and animal origin. The pesticides included in this study have MRLs in honey and pollen between 10 and 50ngg-1. In the present work, an analytical method was developed with the aim of determining residues of fipronil and some of its metabolites (fipronil sulfone, fipronil sulfide, fipronil desulfinyl and fipronil carboxamide), thiamethoxam and imidacloprid in honey and pollen samples. The extraction optimization was performed using a Doehlert experimental design by studying two factors, the mixture and the ratio of solvents used. Prior to the extraction procedure, raw hive samples containing honey, pollen and wax were centrifuged at 4000. rpm. The upper solid material was removed, and 1. g of the lower phase was mixed with 3. mL of the optimized mixture of methanol/water (10/90). The extract was passed through a florisil cartridge and the target compounds were eluted with methanol and analysed by LC-MS/MS in selective reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. The method was validated according to the guidelines included in the SANCO/10684/2009 document and the ISO 11843 standard for the following parameters: decision limit (CCα), detection capability (CCβ), recovery, repeatability and reproducibility at 0.5, 1 and 1.5 folds the MRLs. Ion suppression/enhancement effects into the ion source were also assessed. The CCβ values were included between 0.83 and 4.83ngg-1, well below the current MRLs. The validated method was applied to the determination of the target pesticides in 91 samples collected in colonies from 73 apiaries of NW Spain (two sampling campaigns during 2008). None of the target insecticides were detected among all the collected samples. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Fipronil; Honey; Insecticide residues; Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Method validation; Pollen",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953738814

Competition for nest sites is particularly strong when multiple groups of the same species migrate synchronously to found a new home. This may be the case for honey bees during the reproductive season, because neighboring colonies often cast swarms simultaneously, leading to potential competition for high-quality nesting cavities. To test the idea that honey bee swarms may compete for and defend potential nest sites as they search for a new home, we observed pairs of artificial swarms that were house-hunting concurrently. Workers from one swarm in each pair carried a gene influencing body color, so that the bees from the two swarms were easily distinguished. We set up a high-quality nest box and waited for nest-site scouts from each swarm to explore and recruit swarm mates to it. We recorded all the interactions between competing scouts at the nest box and found that when scouts from both swarms explored the box simultaneously they behaved agonistically toward bees from the other swarm. The level of aggression depended on the number of scouts from each swarm present at the nest box. When only one to three scouts from each swarm were at the box, they rarely fought. But when the scouts from one swarm outnumbered those from the other swarm (4-20 vs. one to three bees), those in the majority advertised their presence with a buzzing behavior at the entrance opening, and started mobbing and killing those in the minority. When one swarm gained clear control of the nest box (20+ vs. zero to one bees), some of its scouts guarded the box's entrance, preventing entry by foreign scouts. Our study exemplifies how cavity-nesting animals may compete for and defend suitable nesting sites. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954573734

To determine if mated honey bee queens possess diel rhythmicity in behavior, we observed them in glass-sided observation hives, employing two focal studies involving continuous observations of individual queens as well as a scan-sampling study of multiple queens. In all cases, all behaviors were observed at all times of the day and night. In four of the five queens examined in focal studies, there were no consistent occurrences of diel periodicity for any of the individual behaviors. A more encompassing measure for periodicity, in which the behaviors were characterized as active (walking, inspecting, egg-laying, begging for food, feeding, and grooming self) or inactive (standing), also failed to reveal consistent diel rhythmicity. Furthermore, there were no consistent diel differences in the number of workers in the queen's retinue. Behavioral arrhythmicity persisted across seasons and despite daily changes in both light and temperature levels. Both day and night levels of behavioral activity were correlated with daytime, but not with nighttime, ambient temperatures. The behavior of the one exceptional queen was not consistent: diurnal activity patterns were present during two 24-h observation sessions but arrhythmicity during another. Based on the behavior observed by all but one of the queens examined in this work, the arrhythmic behavior by the mated honey bee queen inside the colony appears to be similar to that exhibited by worker bees before they approach the age of onset of foraging behavior. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Apis mellifera; Behavior; Circadian rhythm; Queen; Social insects",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954865685

C., Veracruz, Mexico","It has been suggested that there is a geographic dichotomy in the pollination systems of chiropterophilous columnar cacti: in intra-tropical areas they are pollinated almost exclusively by bats, whereas in extratropical areas they are pollinated by bats, birds and bees. However, currently the studies are clumped both taxonomically (mainly Pachycereeae species) and geographically (mainly in the Tehuacan Valley and the Sonoran Desert). This clumping limits the possibility of generalising the pattern to other regions or cactus tribes. Only four of the 36 chiropterophilous cacti in Pilosocereus have been studied. Despite the tropical distribution of two Pilosocereus species, bees account for 40-100% of their fruit set. We examined how specialised is the pollination system of P. leucocephalus in eastern Mexico. As we studied tropical populations, we expected a bat-specialised pollination system. However, previous studies of Pilosocereus suggest that a generalised pollination system is also possible. We found that this cactus is mainly bat-pollinated (bats account for 33-65% of fruit set); although to a lesser degree, diurnal visitors also caused some fruit set (7-15%). Diurnal visitors were more effective in populations containing honeybee hives. P. leucocephalus is partially self-compatible (14-18% of fructification) but unable to set fruit without visitors. Despite the variation in pollination system, P. leucocephalus shows more affinity with other columnar cacti from tropical regions than with those from extratropical regions. Although we report here that a new species of tropical Pilosocereus is relatively bat-specialised, this Cereeae genus is more flexible in its pollination system than the Pachycereeae genera. © 2009 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","Columnar cactus; Nectar-feeding bats; Pilosocereus leucocephalus; Pollination system",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955955681

We proposed two hypotheses: the amount of buried seeds of R. pseudoacacia is proportional to stand biomass rather than stand age, and apicultural utilization influences the size of the soil seed bank. R. pseudoacacia generally produces seeds with various degrees of physical dormancy. In addition, this tree is short-lived, and fecundity declines after 30-40 years in relation to tree vigor. However, R. pseudoacacia is intensively used in apiculture as an important honey source, and supply of honeybees by beekeepers could influence seed crops. We investigated 25 plantations in Hokkaido (Central, Hidaka, and Oshima) and in Nagano, Japan, where many naturally regenerated R. pseudoacacia stands occur. We found great variation in the size of the soil seed bank among stands, ranging from 13,757 to 6.4seedsm-2 per plot. A generalized linear mixed model revealed that both basal area (BARp) and apicultural utilization best explained the size of the soil seed bank. Both the positive effect of BARp and small contribution of stand age to the model implied that the soil seed bank is transitory, and will not persist for very long time. The large contribution of apicultural utilization to the size of the soil seed bank implied pollinator limitation under natural conditions. R. pseudoacacia often has large flower crops, and native pollinators can not keep up with the demand for pollination. Thus, the supply of honeybees by beekeepers should improve the pollination success of R. pseudoacacia. From these results, we conclude that we must consider stand history with respect to apicultural utilization if the land is harvested or a stand declines. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Apiculture; Robinia pseudoacacia; Soil seed bank; Stand age; Stand growth",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954952016

The large-scale application of pesticides in agriculture and horticulture can lead to mass mortality among bees, and the chemicals find their way into bee products. The presence of xenobiotics in these products can lower their quality and cause their properties to deteriorate, which in consequence may endanger human health. All this means that the analysis of bees, honey and other bee products is becoming a matter of increasing urgency.

We examined plant size, plant flower density, flower visitation rates by insects, counts of pollen per stigma and presence/absence of germinated pollen, fruit and seed set ratios and rates of pre-dispersal seed predation. Flower densities on plants in restored areas were significantly higher than in forest remnants. Bees were the most common flower visitors. Plants in revegetated areas attracted significantly more flower visitors with visitor assemblages usually dominated by A. mellifera. Plants in revegetated areas had similar numbers of flowers per inflorescence, while fruit and seed set per inflorescence was significantly higher in forest remnants. There was no significant difference in the rates of pre-dispersal seed predation. Plants in revegetated areas and forest remnants had similar seed output with no apparent negative effect of A. mellifera on seed production. Restoration of native vegetation in an urban context is a challenging long-term process. However, introduction of dominant plant species can foster a rapid return of their pollinators.

Topical application was carried out by subjecting mites to contact with various propolis concentrations for different periods of time, which resulted in mortality and narcosis. Acaricidal effects were stronger with increasing concentrations of the propolis extracts. Spraying infested bees with a 10% propolis solution was harmless for bees but killed 78% of mites.

The purpose of this test was to evaluate whether the sunflower itself causes the weakening and if so, to quantify it. The results show that bee foraging on flowering sunflowers had neither a noxious effect on bee populations during the blooming period nor in the following months. Likewise, winter losses did not increase. The bees visited the sunflowers intensively but harvests of sunflower nectar were non-existent or low.

The Biblical term ""honey"" commonly was interpreted as the sweet product of fruits, such as dates and figs. The recent discovery of unfired clay cylinders similar to traditional hives still used in the Near East at the site of Tel Reh:ov in the Jordan valley in northern Israel suggests that a large-scale apiary was located inside the town, dating to the 10th - early 9th centuries B.C.E. This paper reports the discovery of remains of honeybee workers, drones, pupae, and larvae inside these hives. The exceptional preservation of these remains provides unequivocal identification of the clay cylinders as the most ancient beehives yet found. Morphometric analyses indicate that these bees differ from the local subspecies Apis mellifera syriaca and from all subspecies other than A. m. anatoliaca, which presently resides in parts of Turkey. This finding suggests either that the Western honeybee subspecies distribution has undergone rapid change during the last 3,000 years or that the ancient inhabitants of Tel Rehcombining dot belowov imported bees superior to the local bees in terms of their milder temper and improved honey yield.","Apis mellifera; Biogeography; Climate change; Domestication; Iron age IIA",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954900571

If the bee's head were fixed to its thorax, such movements would have great impact on vision. Head movements independent of thorax orientation can stabilize gaze and thus play an important and active role in shaping the structure of the visual input the animal receives. Here, we investigate how gaze and flight control interact in a homing task. We use high-speed video equipment to record the head and body movements of honeybees approaching and departing from a food source that was located between three landmarks in an indoor flight arena. During these flights, the bees' trajectories consist of straight flight segments combined with rapid turns. These short and fast yaw turns ('saccades') are in most cases accompanied by even faster head yaw turns that start about 8 ms earlier than the body saccades. Between saccades, gaze stabilization leads to a behavioural elimination of rotational components from the optical flow pattern, which facilitates depth perception from motion parallax. © 2010 The Royal Society.","Bee; Behaviour; Flight control; Gaze stabilization; Homing; Vision",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954037906

Among a large number of bee diseases, chalkbrood has been on the rise. We present here the experimental identification of honey bee genes that are differentially expressed in response to infection of honey bee larvae with the chalkbrood fungus, Ascosphaera apis.Results: We used cDNA-AFLP ®Technology to profile transcripts in infected and uninfected bee larvae. From 64 primer combinations, over 7,400 transcriptionally-derived fragments were obtained A total of 98 reproducible polymorphic cDNA-AFLP fragments were excised and sequenced, followed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of these and additional samples.We have identified a number of differentially-regulated transcripts that are implicated in general mechanisms of stress adaptation, including energy metabolism and protein transport. One of the most interesting differentially-regulated transcripts is for a chitinase-like enzyme that may be linked to anti-fungal activities in the honey bee larvae, similarly to gut and fat-body specific chitinases found in mosquitoes and the red flour beetle. Surprisingly, we did not find many components of the well-characterized NF-κB intracellular signaling pathways to be differentially-regulated using the cDNA-AFLP approach. Therefore, utilizing qRT-PCR, we probed some of the immune related genes to determine whether the lack of up-regulation of their transcripts in our analysis can be attributed to lack of immune activation or to limitations of the cDNA-AFLP approach.Conclusions: Using a combination of cDNA-AFLP and qRT-PCR analyses, we were able to determine several key transcriptional events that constitute the overall effort in the honey bee larvae to fight natural fungal infection. Honey bee transcripts identified in this study are involved in critical functions related to transcriptional regulation, apoptotic degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, nutritional regulation, and RNA processing. We found that immune regulation of the anti-fungal responses in honey bee involves highly coordinated activation of both NF-κB signaling pathways, leading to production of anti-microbial peptides. Significantly, activation of immune responses in the infected bee larvae was associated with down-regulation of major storage proteins, leading to depletion of nutritional resources. © 2010 Aronstein et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953663202

Here we confirmed this finding showing that recall of the olfactory memory 1 h after training to associate (-)-linalool, a floral volatile compound, with a sugar reward, as revealed by the bee extending its proboscis when presented with the trained odour, was better when the odour was presented to the right rather than to the left antenna. We then measured the number of sensilla present on the left and right antenna by scanning electron microscopy. Results showed that putative olfactory sensilla (placodea, trichodea, basiconica) were significantly more abundant on the right antenna surface than on the left antenna surface, whereas sensilla not involved in olfaction (campaniformia, coeloconica and chaetica) tended to be more abundant on the left than on the right antenna surface. © 2010.","Antennal sensilla; Lateralization; Olfactory learning; SEM",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77649234948

This influence has been demonstrated to be mediated through pheromone communication. However, the only social insect for which any queen pheromone has been identified is the honey bee (Apis mellifera) with its well-known queen mandibular pheromone (QMP). Although pleiotropic effects on colony regulation are accredited to the QMP, this pheromone does not trigger the full behavioral and physiological response observed in the presence of the queen, suggesting the presence of additional compounds. We tested the hypothesis of a pheromone redundancy in honey bee queens by comparing the influence of queens with and without mandibular glands on worker behavior and physiology.Results: Demandibulated queens had no detectable (E)-9-oxodec-2-enoic acid (9-ODA), the major compound in QMP, yet they controlled worker behavior (cell construction and queen retinue) and physiology (ovary inhibition) as efficiently as intact queens.Conclusions: We demonstrated that the queen uses other pheromones as powerful as QMP to control the colony. It follows that queens appear to have multiple active compounds with similar functions in the colony (pheromone redundancy). Our findings support two hypotheses in the biology of social insects: (1) that multiple semiochemicals with synonymous meaning exist in the honey bee, (2) that this extensive semiochemical vocabulary exists because it confers an evolutionary advantage to the colony. © 2010 Maisonnasse et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953632697

The folklore uses, indigenous knowledge of local people, and traditional healers regarding S. persica were collected by using standard protocol. Based on the results obtained, it was concluded that S. persica is a multipurpose plant. It is one of the commonly used plants for medicinal purposes as well as due to its ethno-ecological importance. Various parts of S. persica are used as: food, fruits, fodder, a source of lipids, gum and resins. In addition, it is also used as a honey bee rearing plant. Its root is regularly used as tooth brush throughout the country. During the current study, it was also noticed that S. persica is a service provider plant which is grown to provide shelter-belts and windbreaker for agriculture crops. It helps in reclamation of sand dune habitat and saline soil in arid ecosystem of Saudi Arabia. S. Persica is distributed throughout the arid and semi arid ecosystem of Saudi Arabia. However, its population suffers from serious environmental problems such as deforestation, soil degradation, loss of biodiversity and unsustainable livelihoods. The study concluded that S. persica has high medicinal, economic and ecological values in arid and semiarid ecosystem of Saudi Arabia. Nevertheless, its conservation status is highly threatened and detailed ecological study of S. persica is suggested to conserve its remaining population in Saudi Arabia. © 2010 Academic Journals.","Medicinal uses; Products; S. persica; Threats and conservation importance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954858280

It has been widely studied in vertebrates, but it has been substantially less well studied in invertebrates. We present an investigation into latent inhibition in the honey bee (Apis mellifera) using a proboscis extension response conditioning procedure that involved 'preexposure' of an odor without reinforcement prior to appetitive conditioning. A significant latent inhibition effect, measured in terms of a reduction in acquisition performance to the preexposed odor, was observed after 8 unreinforced presentations, and the effect continued to increase in strength up to 30 presentations. We also observed that memories formed for the preexposed odor lasted at least 24 h. Further manipulation of interstimulus interval and the visual conditioning context partially attenuated the effect.

(africanized) in an apiary situated in Pará de Minas, Minas Gerais state, and evaluate the pollen prefences among the beehives. Two beehives of Langstroth type with frontal pollen trap collectors were used. The harvest was made from September 2007 to March 2008, with three samples of pollen pellets colected per month per beehive. The subsamples of 2 grams each were prepared according to the European standard melissopalynological method. A total of 56 pollen types were observed, identifying 43 genus and 32 families. The families that showed the major richness of pollen types were: Mimosaceae (8), Asteraceae (6), Fabaceae (3), Arecaceae (3), Euphorbiaceae (3), Rubiaceae (3), Caesalpiniaceae (2), Moraceae (2) and Myrtaceae (2). The most frequent pollen types (> 45%) were Mimosa scabrella, Myrcia and Sorocea. The results demonstrated a similarity regarding the preferences of floral sources during the major part of the time. There was a distinct utilization of floral sources among the pollen types of minor frequency. In spite of the strong antropic influence, the region showed a great polliniferous variety, which was an indicative of the potential for monofloral as well as heterofloral pollen production.","Africanized apis mellifera; Brazil; Pará de minas; Pollen pellets; Polliniferous flora",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954180569

It has been suggested that N. ceranae induces significantly higher mortality in honey bees than N. apis, but little is known about their comparative virulence. In this study, we used in vivo infection experiments to study the two parasites' different virulence (i.e. multiplication rate and infectivity). A qPCR was developed to elucidate within host competition between the two parasites using mixed infections. The outcome of the experiments indicates minor differences in infectious dose and multiplication rate between the two species. Moreover, the mortality caused by N. ceranae was not significantly higher than for N. apis and N. ceranae appeared to have no competitive advantage within host. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Competition; Mixed species infection; Nosema apis; Nosema ceranae; Virulence",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953138713

Total spore counts and purified total genomic DNA were obtained from 37 bee samples (19 individual workers and 18 pooled samples of 15 workers) collected in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland, Canada. Overall, the prevalence of Nosema species was 86.5% (32/37 samples of bee DNA), based on conventional PCR and the optimized R-T PCR assay.

Animals that collect pollen without pollinating (pollen thieves) could reduce siring success of thieved plants and cause pollen limitation of seed set at the population level; however, such impacts on plant reproduction have not been demonstrated experimentally. To test these effects we added hives of native honey bees (Apis mellifera scutellata) to populations of a primarily bird-pollinated plant, Aloe maculata, in eastern South Africa. In field and aviary trials, bee addition increased pollen removal from anthers but decreased pollen deposition on stigmas, and so reduced both male and female pollination components. Further, total seed production decreased with hive addition in the aviary experiment and in three of four field populations, indicating that population-level pollen theft can also compromise reproductive success. In the field, naturally occurring allodapine bees also seemed to act as pollen thieves, outweighing the effect of honey bee hive addition at one of the four aloe populations. Our results highlight the importance of social, bees as pollen thieves, even of plants that have evolved in their presence, and the role of dichogamy in promoting pollen theft. Given the commonness of both social bees and dichogamy, pollen theft is likely a much more common influence on floral ecology and evolution than suggested by the sparse literature. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Aloe maculata; Antagonist; Apis mellifera scutellata; Cheating, honey bee; Pollen theft; Pollination efficiency; South africa; Sunhirds",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953258589

This is also true for the introduction of genetically modified organisms (GMO) into agriculture. In Germany, precautionary regulations currently demand isolation distances (i. e. buffer zones) for the cultivation of genetically modified maize (Bt-maize) in the vicinity of conventional (150 m) and organic maize fields (300 m). The Bt-toxin may harm non-target organisms (NTO) such as Lepidoptera. Despite this, corresponding regulations for the protection of nature reserves are lacking to date. Conventional and Bt-maize have been grown in the vicinity of the Flora-Fauna-Habitat (FFH) Ruhlsdorfer Bruch in Brandenburg, Germany. The aim of this study was to investigate whether exposure of maize pollen from surrounding Bt-maize fields to NTOs in the nature protection area could be excluded or not. Two types of exposure were investigated: Firstly, whether maize pollen was dispersed by wind into the nature reserve area exposing resident NTOs. Secondly, foraging NTOs from the nature reserve are exposed by roaming the surrounding fields and collecting maize pollen. In order to fulfil the precautionary principle defined by law, the study should help to determine appropriate isolation distances for the cultivation f Bt-maize with regard to sustainable protection of NTOs in the FFH Ruhlsdorfer Bruch. In 2007, the local authorities issued an isolation distance between Bt-maize fields and nature reserves of 100 m and in 2008, this became 250 m in the northern and 500 m in the westerly direction, respectively. Materials and methods Standardised methods for biological and technical pollen sampling issued by the Association of German Engineers (VDI 4330 Part 3, 2007 and VDI 4330 Part 4, 2006) were applied providing a quality controlled and methodologically harmonised database which does not only serve the needs to be fulfilled by the present case-specific monitoring study but can also be used as a reference database for further investigations. Maize pollen exposure was measured within the FFH Ruhlsdorfer Bruch and its immediate vicinity in July and August 2007 and 2008. In 2007, the sampling was performed at three sites using 12 technical samplers (Sigma-2/PMF) placed at five measuring points at distances from 5 m to 120 m from the maize field edges. Additionally, for biological pollen sampling six bee colonies were situated at these three sites (two colonies at each site). The technical sampler Sigma-2/PMF enables point sampling which is primarily influenced by wind and topography providing information on effective maize pollen input (flow and deposition) at the measuring sites. Honey-bees roaming in the surrounding area with typical foraging distances of several kilometres may act as planar collectors. They may serve as indicators for the exposure to pollen-collecting NTOs. Furthermore, biological sampling is more selective due to the organism's preferences, whereas the technical sampling is neutral. Hence, both the technical and the biological sampling complement each other in their scope of application. The pollen samples of both matrices were analysed microscopically and the maize pollen loads were quantified. Pollen-DNA was analysed by means of the quantitative PCR-method (qPCR) identifying conventional and Bt-maize pollen by two independent laboratories. In 2008, the monitoring was repeated with additional sites. Eighteen technical samplers were exposed at five sites with eight measuring points at distances from 5 m to 250 m from the maize field edges. Two honey-bee colonies for biological sampling were placed at one site for control purposes. PCR-analyses were performed to measure the amounts of Bt-maize pollen in the samples. Results The results of pollen monitoring at the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch revealed maize pollen exposure for all monitoring sites in both surveys. In 2007, up to 1.75 million maize pollen/m2 were deposited at sites closest to the maize field. At 120 m from field edge in the middle of the FFH-reserve, 99,000 maize pollen/m2 were detected. In 2008, similar results were found, at distances up to 250 m from the field edges deposition of 164,000 maize pollen/m2 was detected. Data on maize pollen deposition show a clear distance relationship and are in accordance with results of further comprehensive surveys based on the same methodology (Hofmann 2007). The results of the microscopic analysis of the pollen pellets demonstrated that bees collected maize pollen at all sites, in 2007 and 2008. Although maize pollen is not the main food source (2007: 0.1-0.3 %; 2008:2-3 %) the collection efficiency of the bee colonies resulted in high amounts of sampled maize pollen with 4 to 11 million per site in 2007 and up to 467 million in 2008. Molecular-biological analysis of maize pollen DNA by qPCR demonstrated that transgenic Bt-MON810 DNA was present in all technical and biological samples, corroborated by two independent laboratories. In 2007, the GMO-content in the samples ranged up to 44 % in the bioaerosols and 49 % in the pollen pellets. In 2008, GMO-proportions of up to 18 % were detected. Discussion The results of this study provide evidence that NTOs in the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch were exposed to Bt-maize pollen under the cultivation conditions in 2007 with a buffer zone of 100 m. The GMO-content reached up to 48 %. The results of the monitoring in 2008 confirmed these findings. Even though the exposure could be reduced by increasing the isolation distances to 250 m and 500 m respectively, the results still show percentages of up to 18 % Bt-MON810 in the pollen samples. The results on maize pollen deposition at the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch in 2007 and 2008 correspond to the results of an investigation which was conducted over several years applying the same standardised method, but covering a wider range of distances. The correlation between maize pollen deposition (n/m2) and distance to the source field (m) fitted best to a power function of the type y = 1.2086 ""106"" x-0.548. Despite the same trend, the pollen deposition in the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch revealed above-average findings. Also the analysis of the pollen pellets collected by the bees showed an exposure in 2007 with values for the GMO-content of up to 49 %. For both methods, the exposure decreased in 2008 due to the greater buffer zones up to 500 m. Whereas the GMO-content for the biological sampling were reduced to values below 10 %, the values for the technical sampling were still higher indicating that greater buffer zones would be necessary for safety reasons under the precautionary principle. Conclusions The results of this investigation proved that maize pollen were dispersed by wind to distances farther than 250 m from field edge leading to maize pollen exposure in the centre of the nature reserve. The results also demonstrated that foraging NTOs living in the nature reserve were exposed to maize pollen from surrounding fields. Considering the cultivation of Bt-maize MON810, the assumption of the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) that there will be no relevant exposure beyond the Bt-maize fields, cannot be confirmed. Considering the results of this and related studies and with respect to the precautionary principle, one can state that buffer zones between Bt-maize fields and protected areas are an effective measure to minimise the exposure of Bt-maize pollen to NTOs and, thus, to prevent from adverse effects. Recommendations and perspectives Because of still insufficient ecotoxicological data for the risk assessment of Bt-maize MON810 considering butterflies and other protected NTOs, protection standards assuring the precautionary principle have to be implemented to avoid Bt-maize pollen exposure to NTOs. This applies for the case Ruhlsdorfer Bruch and for nature reserve areas in general. In order to exclude risks to protected NTOs occurring in nature reserves, sufficient buffer zones for Bt-maize cultivation should be considered. The statistical analysis revealed that distances of more than 500 m are necessary to decisively reduce exposure to foraging insects. In fact, distances of more than 1,000 m are necessary to prevent maize pollen deposition from values above 100,000 pollen/m2 with a certainty of 90 %. An adequate risk assessment can only be attained if based on field measurements accounting for the high variation of pollen deposition due to local environmental site conditions and field management. The monitoring should be based on standardised methods. It should include locations with the highest expected deposition rates, the boundaries of the protected areas and sites of interest within those boundaries, e. g., specific habitats of sensitive species. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","Biomonitoring; Bt-maize; Buffer zone; Deposition; Exposure; Flora-Fauna-Habitate (FFH); Genetically modified organisms (GMO); Honey-bee Apis mellifera; Isolation distance; Maize; Mon810; Monitoring; Nature reserve; Non-target-organisms (NTO); Pollen; Pollen mass filter (PMF); Pollen monitoring; Protected area; Quantitative PCR (qPCR); Regulation; Safety distance; TaqMan",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956590126

These chitinases were active in a broad pH range (5-9) and the optimum temperatures were between 60 and 75°C. Synergistic effects of ChiA and ChiB on the miticidal activity against V. destructor were observed. The workers of both honey bee species were not sensitive to the spraying and feeding chitinases.

Fourteen propolis samples were organoleptic and physicochemically characterized and, by means topical applications, their activity was tested on mites. All propolis had a homogeneous composition and the bioactivity levels against mites were comparable among the different propolis samples. The percentage of mites killed by the treatments ranged between 60.5% and 90% after 30 s of exposure. Thus, V. destructor was highly susceptible to propolis. Moreover, the mites remained anesthetized during the first hours after topical treatment.

Here, we report identification and characterization of defensins in the parasitic wasp Nasonia (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae). In comparison with those in the non-parasitic insect Apis mellifera, two different subtypes of defensins (defensin1 and defensin2) have undergone independent gene duplication to create a mutigene family of five members (named 1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 2-2 and 2-3) in the Nasonia lineage. Such duplication occurred before the divergence of three sibling species (N. vitripennis, N. giraulti and N. longicornis) and the duplicated genes was subsequently subjected to positive selection at the amino-terminal loop and the γ-core region. RT-PCR identified that only the subtype 1 of defensins were constitutively expressed in the N. vitripennis adult stage and none of the five defensins was expressed in other developmental stages (i.e. the infected Musca domestica pupae). A functional form of 2-2 in N. vitripennis (named navidefensin2-2) was produced in Escherichia coli by an on-column refolding approach. The recombinant peptide presented a typical defensin structure, as identified by CD analysis, and selectively inhibited the growth of two Gram+ bacteria at low micromolar concentrations. The bioactive surface responsible for antibacterial activity of navidefensin2-2 was identified in the γ-core region of this molecule.

A neighbor-joining phenogram representing genetic distance data showed clear distinction of Russian and non-Russian honey bee stocks. Furthermore, a test of appropriate sample size showed a sample of eight bees per colony maximizes accuracy and consistency of the results. An additional 34 samples were tested as blind samples (origin unknown to those collecting data) to determine accuracy of individual assignment tests. Only one of these samples was incorrectly assigned. The 18 current breeding lines were represented among the 2009 blind sampling, demonstrating temporal stability of the genetic stock identification assay. The certification assay will be used through services provided by a service laboratory, by the Russian Bee Breeders Association to genetically certify their stock. The genetic certification will be used in conjunction with continued selection for favorable traits, such as honey production and varroa and tracheal mite resistance. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.","Genetic stock identification; Honey bee; Microsatellite; Single-nucleotide polymorphism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953079342

Observational studies suggest that there are a set of conditions required for the production of toxic honey, but these factors have not been well studied. This research aims to investigate the importance of altitude and weather conditions for the production of toxic honey in New Zealand and makes some recommendations for a review of the New Zealand Food Safety Authority (NZFSA) Food (tutin in honey) Standard 2008 that was introduced after a toxic honey outbreak in 2008. Transects were established in parts of the North Island during the summer of 2009 and were visited weekly for 6 consecutive weeks. Variables recorded were elevation, S. australis density, honeydew abundance, honey bee and wasp (Vespula spp.) presence and temperature and rainfall data. Weather conditions present during the 2008 outbreak were compared with those from 1999 to 2009. S. australis were not present at altitudes of 375 m and above; with more research, some higher areas of New Zealand may be able to be reclassified as 'low risk'. Honeydew was available in a wide range of temperature and rainfall conditions. Rainfall appeared to wash honeydew from tutu bushes; however, it quickly reappeared in densely populated sites. Honey bee and wasp presence was positively affected by the presence of honeydew, nevertheless 3-50% of the time they were observed foraging in the absence of honeydew, indicating they may feed on small amounts of dew. As the absence of honeydew is an option given by the NZFSA to demonstrate honey safety, this requires investigation. Weather conditions leading up to the 2008 toxic honey outbreak were warm and dry but were not significantly different from other years. Therefore, inadequate management practices, rather than more favourable environmental conditions were probably responsible for the 2008 toxic honey outbreak. Future research should focus on determining the conditions required for toxic levels of honeydew to be incorporated into hives, and regions that have not produced toxic honey historically should be closely studied to determine whether any fit the low-risk criteria. © 2010 The Royal Society of New Zealand.","Altitude; Apis mellifera; Coriaria arborea; Honeydew; New Zealand; Rainfall; Scolypopa australis; Temperature; Toxic honey",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959759935

Using this method, mitochondrial, nuclear and chloroplast DNA (mtDNA, nuDNA, cpDNA) markers were successfully extracted, PCR amplified, and sequenced from a range of honeys, and the relative amount of plant nuDNA and cpDNA, and bee mtDNA in the samples was quantified using quantitative real-time PCR. Short, but taxonomically informative lengths of insect and plant organelle DNA could be routinely recovered from all honey samples tested, and longer organelle, and nuclear DNA sequences can be recovered from many. The data also enabled preliminary characterisation of the quality of these different DNA sources in honey. Although the absolute quantity of the different genetic markers varied considerably between sample, a general trend was observed of insect mtDNA dominating over plant organelle DNA, and with plant nuclear DNA at the lowest levels. Furthermore there was a clear correlation between the plant DNA content and the success of the PCR assays. To maximise successful characterisation of samples, future studies are recommended to focus on the use of organelle markers, and limit the size of PCR amplicons targeted, although with appropriate sample selection and assay optimisation, other approaches may be possible. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Chloroplast DNA; Honey bee; Mitochondrial DNA; Nuclear DNA",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952419768

Objective: To establish recombinant allergen-based IgE tests to diagnose bee and yellow jacket wasp allergy. Methods: Sera from patients with bee and/or wasp allergy (n = 43) and patients with pollen allergy with false-positive IgE serology to venom extracts were tested for IgE reactivity in allergen extract-based tests or with purified allergens, including nonglycosylated Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant (r) Api m 1, rApi m 2, rVes v 5, and insect cell-expressed, glycosylated rApi m 2 as well as 2 natural plant glycoproteins (Phl p 4, bromelain). Results: The patients with venom allergy could be diagnosed with a combination of E coli-expressed rApi m 1, rApi m 2, and rVes v 5 whereas patients with pollen allergy remained negative. For a group of 29 patients for whom the sensitizing venom could not be identified with natural allergen extracts, testing with nonglycosylated allergens allowed identification of the sensitizing venom. Recombinant nonglycosylated allergens also allowed definition of the sensitizing venom for those 14 patients who had reacted either with bee or wasp venom extracts. By IgE inhibition studies, it is shown that glycosylated Api m 2 contains carbohydrate epitopes that cross-react with natural Api m 1, Ves v 2, natural Phl p 4, and bromelain, thus identifying cross-reactive structures responsible for serologic false-positive test results or double-positivity to bee and wasp extracts. Conclusion: Nonglycosylated recombinant bee and wasp venom allergens allow the identification of patients with bee and wasp allergy and should facilitate accurate prescription of venom immunotherapy. © 2010 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.","glycosylation; in vitro diagnosis; recombinant allergen; Venom allergy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952743996

In the present work, the authors investigated the functional specificity of BV as an angiogenesis inhibitor using in vitro models and in vivo mouse angiogenesis and lung metastasis models. BV significantly inhibited the viability of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells but did not affect peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes (PBML) cells. BV also inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced proliferation, migration and capillary-like tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Western blotting analysis showed that BV inhibited AKT and MAPK phosphorylation in LLC cells and HUVECs and down regulated expression of VEGF and VEGFR-2 of LLC cells and HUVECs. Also, BV effectively disrupted VEGF-induced neovascularization in Matrigel plugs in our in vivo angiogenesis assay. When given subcutaneously, BV also significantly suppressed tumor angiogenesis through inhibition of VEGF and VEGFR-2 in LLC model. Mice bearing subcutaneous LLC tumors were treated with 1 μg/ml or 10 μg/ml of BV. They showed reductions ranging between 49% and 62% in primary tumor volume and reduction of spontaneous pulmonary metastasis occurrences. Furthermore, BV treatment in the spontaneous lung metastases model after primary tumor excision prolonged their median survival time from 27 to 58 days. These results suggest that the tumor-specific anti-angiogenic activity of BV takes effect during different stages of tumor progression by blocking the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2, and validate the application of BV in lung cancer treatment. © 2009.","Angiogenesis; Bee venom; Metastasis; VEGF; VEGFR-2",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951210918

The beetle is capable of rapid population growth on pollen, honey, and bee brood. It is also capable of feeding and reproducing on various kinds of fruit, but its ability to sustain population growth on diets other than bee products has remained unknown. We examined this question by observing A. tumida on 2 diets: pollen dough (inoculated with a species of yeast carried by the beetle) and orange. Age-schedules of survival (lx) and fecundity (mx) were constructed for each diet and used to calculate the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r), which was used to calculate other demographic parameters. The results showed potential for population growth on both diets (r &gt; 0), but the potential was less on orange (r = 0.0631) than on inoculated pollen dough (r = 0.1047). The calculated multiplication per generation on pollen dough was nearly double that on orange and the generation time was shorter by more than a third. Survival of A. tumida populations on oranges, or any other alternative diet, in a given environment would depend on the value of r relative to the strength of environmental conditions opposing population increase. The ability to use alternative diets (fruit, possibly fungi, or other food resources) would confer an adaptive advantage upon beetles dispersing over a landscape in which honeybee colonies occur as small, widely scattered patches.

Curiously, aging progresses slowly in workers that engage in nursing and even slower when bees postpone nursing during unfavorable periods. We, therefore, seek to understand how senescence can emerge as a function of social task performance. The alternative utilization of a common yolk precursor protein (vitellogenin) in nursing and somatic maintenance can link behavior and aging plasticity in worker bees.

In this study, the existence of functional feedback from Drosophila mushroom bodies to the antennal lobes was investigated through ectopic expression of the ATP receptor P2X2 in the Kenyon cells of mushroom bodies. Activation of Kenyon cells induced depolarization in projection neurons and local interneurons in the antennal lobes in a nicotinic receptor-dependent manner. Activation of Kenyon cell axons in the βγ-lobes in the mushroom body induced more potent responses in the antennal lobe neurons than activation of Kenyon cell somata. Our results indicate that functional feedback from Kenyon cells to projection neurons and local interneurons is present in Drosophila and is likely mediated by the βγ-lobes. The presence of this functional feedback from the mushroom bodies to the antennal lobes suggests top-down modulation of olfactory information processing in Drosophila.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953443147

In social insects, such as bees, wasps and ants, plasticity in a particular brain compartment involved in multisensory integration (the mushroom body) has been associated with transitions between tasks differing in cognitive demands. However, in most of these cases, transitions between tasks are age-related, requiring the experimental manipulation of the age structure in the studied colonies to distinguish age and experience-dependent effects. To better understand the interplay between brain plasticity and behavioral performance it would therefore be advantageous to study species whose division of labor is not age-dependent. Here, we focus on brain plasticity in the bumblebee Bombus occidentalis, in which division of labor is strongly affected by the individual's body size instead of age. We show that, like in vertebrates, body size strongly correlates with brain size. We also show that foraging experience, but not age, significantly correlates with the increase in the size of the mushroom body, and in particular one of its components, the medial calyx. Our results support previous findings from other social insects suggesting that the mushroom body plays a key role in experience-based decision making. We also discuss the use of bumblebees as models to analyze neural plasticity and the association between brain size and behavioral performance. Copyright © 2010 S.

Three-dimensional models of the two structural domains were constructed using their amino acid sequences and the crystallographic coordinates of prophenoloxidase-activating factor (PPAF-II) as a template for the SPL domain and the coordinates of porcine spermadhesin PSP-II for the CUB domain. The structural organization of Api m 7 suggests that the CUB domain is involved in interactions with natural substrates while the SPL domain probably activates zymogens.

The method limits of detection were 0.2 ng/g for the parent neonicotinoid pesticides and ranged between 0.2 and 15 ng/g for the neonicotinoid metabolites. This refined method provides lower detection limits and improved recovery of neonicotinoids and their metabolites, which will help researchers evaluate subchronic effects of these pesticides, address data gaps related to colony collapse disorder (CCD), and determine the role of pesticides in pollinator decline. © This article not subject to U.S. Copyright.

This is done to increase its margin of safety against collapse due to a temperature increase.

Resins in the nest may be important in maintaining a healthy colony due to their antimicrobial properties. This study had two main objectives: (1) Provide initial insight on the learning capabilities of resin foraging honeybees; (2) analyze the sensitivity of resin foraging honeybees to tactile stimuli to elucidate its possible role as a mechanism behind resin foraging. The first objective provides insight into the phenotype of these bees as compared to other forager types, while the second creates a starting point for further work on behavioral mechanisms of resin foraging. Using tactile proboscis extension response conditioning, we found that resin foragers learned to associate two different tactile stimuli, the presence of a gap between two plates and a rough sandpaper surface, with a sucrose reward significantly better than pollen foragers. The results of differential tactile conditioning exhibited no significant difference in the ability of resin foragers to discriminate between smooth and rough surfaces as compared to pollen foragers. We also determined that the sucrose response thresholds (SRTs) of returning resin foragers were lower compared to returning pollen foragers, but both resin foragers and pollen foragers learned a floral odor equally well. This is the first study to examine SRTs and conditioning to tactile and olfactory stimuli with resin foraging honeybees. The results provide new information and identify areas for future research on resin collectors, an understudied foraging phenotype. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Conditioning; Proboscis extension response; Propolis; Response thresholds",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956757550

Two types of cell-size foundation were made from the waxes of these species and inserted into mixed colonies headed either by an A. cerana or an A. mellifera queen. The colonies did not discriminate between the waxes but the A. cerana cell-size foundation was modified during comb building by the workers of both species. In pure A. cerana colonies workers did not accept any foundation but secreted wax and built on foundation in mixed colonies. Comb building is performed by small groups of workers through a mechanism of self-organisation. The two species cooperate in comb building and construct nearly normal combs but they contain many irregular cells. In pure A. mellifera colonies, the A. cerana cell size was modified and the queens were reluctant to lay eggs on such combs. In pure A. cerana colonies, the A. mellifera cell size was built without any modification but these cells were used either for drone brood rearing or for food storing. The principal elements of comb-building behaviour are common to both species, which indicates that they evolved prior to and were conserved after speciation. © 2010.

To regulate their ground speed, insects such as honeybees and Drosophila hold the rate of optic flow in the axial direction (front-to-back) constant. A consequence of this strategy is that its performance varies with the minimum viewing angle (the deviation from the frontal direction of the longitudinal axis of the insect) at which changes in axial optic flow are detected. The greater this angle, the later changes in the rate of optic flow, caused by changes in the density of the environment, will be detected. The aim of the present study is to examine the mechanisms of ground speed control in bumblebees and to identify the extent of the visual range over which optic flow for ground speed control is measured. Bumblebees were trained to fly through an experimental tunnel consisting of parallel vertical walls. Flights were recorded when (1) the distance between the tunnel walls was either 15 or 30cm, (2) the visual texture on the tunnel walls provided either strong or weak optic flow cues and (3) the distance between the walls changed abruptly halfway along the tunnel's length. The results reveal that bumblebees regulate ground speed using optic flow cues and that changes in the rate of optic flow are detected at a minimum viewing angle of 23-30deg., with a visual field that extends to approximately 155deg. By measuring optic flow over a visual field that has a low minimum viewing angle, bumblebees are able to detect and respond to changes in the proximity of the environment well before they are encountered. © 2010.

Although DNA methylation likely has a conserved role in gene silencing, the levels and patterns of DNA methylation appear to vary drastically among different organisms. Here we used shotgun genomic bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq) to compare DNA methylation in eight diverse plant and animal genomes. We found that patterns of methylation are very similar in flowering plants with methylated cytosines detected in all sequence contexts, whereas CG methylation predominates in animals. Vertebrates have methylation throughout the genome except for CpG islands. Gene body methylation is conserved with clear preference for exons in most organisms. Furthermore, genes appear to be the major target of methylation in Ciona and honey bee. Among the eight organisms, the green alga Chlamydomonas has the most unusual pattern of methylation, having non-CG methylation enriched in exons of genes rather than in repeats and transposons. In addition, the Dnmt1 cofactor Uhrf1 has a conserved function in maintaining CG methylation in both transposons and gene bodies in the mouse, Arabidopsis, and zebrafish genomes.","BS-Seq; DNA methylation; Epigenetic profiling; Gene body methylation; UHRF1",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952734605

By providing refuge for wild plants and the pollinators associated with them, field margins can also contribute to enhancing the pollination services within the monoculture. However, the effects of the monoculture on pollinator behaviour need to be carefully considered. It is known that pollinators may show density-dependent preferences such as neophobia (an avoidance of unfamiliar items) when different types of flower are available within their environment, and the dominance of monoculture crops within the environment may consequently have adverse effects upon the preferences shown by pollinators living in the field margins within them. In order to examine how pollinator preferences for wild flowers are affected by monocultures, we modelled the effects of density-dependent preferences, flower densities, and the geometry of field margins within a monoculture landscape using numerical simulations. This was done by considering how the placement of pollinator nests within a simple, spatially explicit landscape consisting of fields of monoculture crops separated by margins containing wild flowers affected the ratio of wild and monoculture crops experienced by the pollinator, given that it could only forage within a limited distance from its nest. Increasing field margin width and decreasing monoculture field width both led to an increase in pollinators visiting wild flowers (which levelled off as width increased). The size of the monoculture fields had little additional effect once they had passed an intermediate width. Increasing wild flower density within the margins led to a shift away from preferring monocultures. When wild flowers were at low densities compared to the monoculture, even the addition of small amounts of extra wild flowers had a large effect in shifting foraging preferences away from the monoculture. The distance which pollinators normally forage over only has an effect upon preferences for wild flowers when the travel distance is small. This suggests that careful consideration of margin design might be extremely important for those species which do not travel far. Innate preferences for density-dependence and particular crop types may also have an effect on preference behaviour. We demonstrate that the way in which resources are presented to indigenous pollinators may be extremely important in influencing where they choose to forage within agricultural landscapes. Careful margin design, as well as increasing the density of wild flowers (such as by enhancing the wild seed bank within the margins), may lead to overall improvements in ecosystem function within intensively farmed monocultures. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Differences in the RJ proteome between the two bee species were validated using western-blot analysis. RJ production by A. cerana cerana (3.21 ± 0.43 g) is significantly lower than that of A. mellifera ligustica (80.5 ± 7.83 g). The 2DGE based MS approach identified 52 and 60 proteins in the RJ of A. mellifera ligustica and A. cerana cerana, respectively. The majority of the identified proteins were major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs). Peroxiredoxin 2540, glutathione S-transferase S1, and MRJP5 were detected only in the RJ of A. mellifera ligustica, and MRJP1 was the most abundant MRJP. In contrast, MRJP7 was found only in the RJ of A. cerana cerana. But, similar to A. mellifera ligustica, MRJP1 was found most abundantly in this case too. In this study, glucose oxidase was identified for the first time in the A. cerana cerana RJ. Comparing the protein levels of MRJP1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 between the two species, they were significantly higher in the RJ of A. mellifera ligustica than in A. cerana cerana. This observation was supported by Western blot analysis using anti-MRJP1, 2, 3 antibodies. The result suggested that A. mellifera ligustica needs more nutrition to nurse the developing larvae and queens as compared to that of A. cerana cerana.

Regulation of worker behavior by dominant queens or workers is a hallmark of insect societies, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and their evolutionary conservation are not well understood. Honey bee and bumble bee colonies consist of a single reproductive queen and facultatively sterile workers. The queens' influences on the workers are mediated largely via inhibition of juvenile hormone titers, which affect division of labor in honey bees and worker reproduction in bumble bees. Studies in honey bees identified a transcription factor, Krüppel-homolog 1 (Kr-h1), whose expression in worker brains is significantly downregulated in the presence of a queen or queen pheromone and higher in forager bees, making this gene an ideal candidate for examining the evolutionary conservation of socially regulated pathways in Hymenoptera. Results. In contrast to honey bees, bumble bees foragers do not have higher Kr-h1 levels relative to nurses: in one of three colonies levels were similar in nurses and foragers, and in two colonies levels were higher in nurses. Similarly to honey bees, brain Kr-h1 levels were significantly downregulated in the presence versus absence of a queen. Furthermore, in small queenless groups, Kr-h1 levels were downregulated in subordinate workers with undeveloped ovaries relative to dominant individuals with active ovaries. Brain Kr-h1 levels were upregulated by juvenile hormone treatment relative to a vehicle control. Finally, phylogenetic analysis indicates that KR-H1 orthologs are presence across insect orders. Though this protein is highly conserved between honey bees and bumble bees, there are significant differences between orthologs of insects from different orders. Conclusions. Our results suggest that Kr-h1 is associated with juvenile hormone mediated regulation of reproduction in bumble bees. The expression of this transcription factor is inhibited by the queen and associated with endocrine mediated regulation of social organization in two species of bees. Thus, KR-H1 may transcriptionally regulate a conserved genetic module that is part of a pathway that has been co-opted to function in social behavior, and adjusts the behavior of workers to their social environmental context. © 2010 Shpigler et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951588434

Sampling was carried out from 560 stationary apiaries where bees were kept in traditional hives (woven skeps). The COI-COII regions of 1680 samples were PCR-amplified and sequenced. To reveal the haplotype of studied bees, the obtained sequences were aligned with published sequence data of haplotypes that belong to A. mellifera C phylogenetic lineage.

The mite is carried to the bee brood cell, where it reproduces, by a nurse bee; therefore the selection of the bee stage by the parasite could influence its reproductive success. This study investigates the role of the cuticular hydrocarbons of the European honeybee (Apis mellifera) in host-selection by the mite. Preliminary laboratory bioassays confirmed the preference of the varroa mite for nurse bees over pollen foragers. GC-MS analysis of nurse and pollen bees revealed differences in the cuticular hydrocarbons of the two stages; in particular, it appeared that pollen bees have more (Z)-8-heptadecene than nurse bees. Laboratory experiments showed that treatment of nurse bees with 100 ng of the pure compound makes them repellent to the varroa mite. These results suggest that the mite can exploit the differences in the cuticular composition of its host for a refined selection that allows it to reach a brood cell and start reproduction. The biological activity of the alkene encourages further investigations for the development of novel control techniques based on this compound. © Cambridge University Press 2010.","(Z)-8-heptadecene; Apis mellifera; Host selection; Hydrocarbons; Varroa destructor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953618269

However, beekeeping in this region is still based on traditional technologies and practices and characterised by alarmingly low colonisation and high absconding rates. Using field experiments, we investigated the effects of modern apiary management practices on colonisation and colony performance of the African honey bee (Apis mellifera). Six experimental sites were set in the West-Nile districts of Moyo, Koboko and Yumbe. At each experimental site, 18 log and 18 Kenya Top Bar (KTB) hives were sited. Half of each hive type was sited at waist height and half high up on tall trees. A third of each hive type was baited with natural hive sealant or bee glue (propolis), beeswax or cassava flour respectively. Management practices were introduced three months after hive siting. Colonisation was significantly (χ2 = 38.20) higher in hives placed high on trees than those placed at standard waist height. KTB hives were better (χ2 = 30.06) colonised than log hives. Propolis baited hives were better (χ2 = 62.08) colonised than wax or cassava baited ones. Colonisation significantly (χ2 = 39.19) improved in experimental sites where routine management practices were instituted compared to sites with no management. Most (73%) that were categorised as strong were in sites where routine management was instituted. We conclude that, wide adoption and application of modern beekeeping practices could tremendously improve colony performance and apiculture production in the west-Nile region.","Absconding; Baits; Beekeeping; Colonisation; Hive types; West-nile",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953857278

To test whether the oils are palatable or whether honey bees showed a preference, they were added to a low-fat pollen known to be attractive to bees. Oils were added at 2% above the known oil content of the pollen to a level about half that of a range of melliferous plants. Of 27 different plant and fish-based oils, only linseed and coconut oil-enhanced pollen diets were consumed by bees at a significantly greater rate (P < 0.05) than pollen itself. Other oils added to pollen that had higher but not significantly different consumption rates by bees to pollen in palatability tests were (highest to lowest): evening primrose, almond, grape seed, apricot, olive, blended vegetable, orange essential oil (EO), linoleic acid, soyabean, avocado, mustard seed, cod liver, sesame and canola. Other oils found unpalatable and discarded from further testing were: gingelly, castor, peanut, rose EO, oleic acid, fish, sunflower, macadamia, rice bran, clary sage EO and lavender EO. At 2%, two of the four essential oils tested were found to be significantly unpalatable and not preferred by bees. The concentration of lavender and clary sage in a pollen diet was perhaps too high. Using alcohol via the addition of 2% rum to enhance volatiles from the pollen diet effectively increased consumption of pollen diets by honey bees. Using both palatability and preference testing methodologies to determine the attractiveness of diets to bees gave the same result. Either test will give the researcher a way of determining the food value of ingredients in diets or full diets. © 2010 The Authors.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether ethanol doses that affect honeybee behavior also induce a significant stress response, measured by heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) concentrations, in honeybee brain tissues. Experiment 1 examined how pretreatment handling influenced brain HSP70 concentrations in three pretreatment groups of bees; immediately after being collected, after being harnessed and fed, and after 22-24. h in a harness. HSP70 concentrations did not differ among pretreatment groups within replicates, although we observed significantly different HSP70 concentrations between the two replicates. Experiment 2 investigated the relationship between ethanol dose and brain HSP70 concentrations. Bees were placed in seven experimental groups, the three pretreatment groups as in Experiment 1 and four ethanol-fed groups. Bees in ethanol treatments were fed 1.5. M sucrose (control) and 1.5. M sucrose-ethanol solutions containing 2.5, 5, and 10% ethanol, allowed to sit for 4. h, and dissected brains were assayed for HSP70. We observed ethanol-induced increases in honeybee brain HSP70 concentrations from the control group through the 5% ethanol group. Only bees in the 5% ethanol group had HSP70 concentrations significantly higher than the control group. The inverted U-shaped ethanol dose-HSP70 concentration response curve indicated that ingestion of 2.5% ethanol and 5% ethanol stimulated the stress response, whereas ingestion of 10% ethanol inhibited the stress response. Doses that show maximum HSP70 concentration (5% ethanol) or HSP70 inhibition (10% ethanol) correspond to those (≥5% ethanol) that also impaired honeybees in previous studies. We conclude that acute ethanol intoxication by solutions containing ≥5% ethanol causes significant ethanol-induced stress in brain tissue that impairs honeybee behavior and associative learning. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Apis mellifera; Ethanol; Honeybee; HSP70; Stress",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953542462

This is the first time that the indigenous honey bees from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republic of Macedonia have been analyzed using a molecular approach. Sampling was carried out from 560 stationary apiaries where bees were kept in traditional hives (woven skeps). The COI-COII regions of 1680 samples were PCR-amplified and sequenced. To reveal the haplotype of studied bees, the obtained sequences were aligned with published sequence data of haplotypes that belong to A. mellifera C phylogenetic lineage. The C2D mtDNA haplotype was found in all honey bees sampled from Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republic of Macedonia. These results show that A. m. carnica and A. m. macedonica share the same C2D mtDNA haplotype. COI gene segments of 1680 samples were PCR-amplified and digested with restriction enzymes NcoI and StyI in order to discriminate A. m. macedonica from A. m. carnica. Amplified fragment patterns produced by both restriction enzymes matched with diagnostic pattern characteristic for A. m. macedonica in case of samples from east, south and south-west parts of Serbia, and Republic of Macedonia, fragments of samples from northern part of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina did not include NcoI and StyI restriction sites. These results indicate that honey bees from east, south and south-west parts of Serbia, and Republic of Macedonia belong to the A. m. macedonica, and honey bees from northern part of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina belong to another subspecies, probably to the A. m. carnica.

Selfing in synchronous monocarps may provide reproductive assurance but conflict with the benefits of outcrossing, a key evolutionary driver of synchrony. We predicted that animal-pollinated species with synchronous flowering would have unspecialised flowers and attract abundant generalised pollinators, but predictions for selfing and outcrossing frequencies were not obvious. We examined the pollination biology of Isoglossa woodii (Acanthaceae), an insect-pollinated, monocarpic herb that flowers synchronously at 4-7-year intervals. The most frequent visitor to I. woodii flowers was the African honeybee, Apis mellifera adansonii. Hand-pollination failed to enhance seed production, indicating that the pollinators were not saturated. No seed was set in the absence of pollinators. Seed set was similar among selfed and outcrossed flowers, demonstrating a geitonogamous mixed-mating strategy with no direct evidence of preferential outcrossing. Flowers contained four ovules, but most fruits only developed one seed, raising the possibility that preferential outcrossing occurs by post-pollination processes. We argue that a number of the theoretical concerns about geitonogamous selfing as a form of reproductive assurance do not apply to a long-lived synchronous monocarp such as I. woodii. © 2009 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","Apis mellifera adansonii; Breeding system; Flowering synchrony; Fruit and seed set; Insect pollination; Mixed mating system; Nectar production; Semelparity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955801310

Queenright workers generally abstain from personal reproduction, raising only the queen's offspring. Queenless workers activate their ovaries, produce eggs, and reduce the rate at which they destroy worker-laid eggs, so that some eggs are reared to maturity. Reduced policing of worker-laid eggs renders queenless nests vulnerable to worker reproductive parasitism (WRP), and may result in the colony raising eggs of unrelated (non-natal) workers that parasitize it. Queenless colonies of A. florea are heavily parasitized with the eggs of non-natal workers. However, queenless colonies often abscond upon disturbance and build a small comb in which to rear their own male offspring. We investigated three naturally occurring orphaned colonies to determine if they are also parasitized. We show that WRP is present in orphaned colonies, and non-natal workers have significantly higher rates of ovary activation than natal workers. In contrast to experimentally manipulated colonies, in our samples, natal and non-natal workers had statistically equal reproductive success, but this may have been due to the small number of non-natals present. © Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel/Switzerland 2009.","Absconding; Apis florea; Queenless; Worker reproductive parasitism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867142467

In this work, a new BvPLA2 (AccPLA2) gene from the Chinese honeybee (Apis cerana cerana) venom glands was inserted into bacmid to construct a recombinant transfer vector. Tn-5B-4 (Tn) cells were transfected with the recombinant bacmid DNA for expression. Sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis revealed a double band with molecular weights of 16 and 18 kDa. Products of hexahistidine AccPLA2 fusion protein accumulated up to 5.32% of the total cellular proteins. The AccPLA 2 fusion protein was cross reactive with the anti-AmPLA2 (BvPLA2 of the European honeybee, Apis mellifera) polyclonal serum. The reaction resulted in a double glycosylation band, which agrees with the band generated by the native AmPLA2 in Western blot analysis. The PLA2 activity of the total extracted cellular protein in the hydrolyzing egg yolk is about 3.16 μmol/(minmg). In summary, the recombinant AccPLA2 protein, a native BvPLA2-like structure with corresponding biological activities, can be glycosylated in Tn cells.

The complexity of some eusocial insect societies appears to arise from self-organized task allocation and group cohesion. One of the best-supported models explaining self-organized task allocation in social insects is the response threshold model, which predicts specialization due to inter-individual variability in sensitivity to task-associated stimuli. The model explains foraging task specialization among honeybee workers, but the factors underlying the differences in individual sensitivity remain elusive. Here, we propose that in honeybees, sensory sensitivity correlates with individual differences in the number of sensory structures, as it does in solitary species. Examining European and Africanized honeybees, we introduce and test the hypothesis that body size and/or sensory allometry is associated with foraging task preferences and resource exploitation. We focus on common morphological measures and on the size and number of structures associated with olfactory sensitivity. We show that the number of olfactory sensilla is greater in pollen and water foragers, which are known to exhibit higher sensory sensitivity, compared to nectar foragers. These differences are independent of the distribution of size within a colony. Our data also suggest that body mass and number of olfactory sensilla correlate with the concentration of nectar gathered by workers, and with the size of pollen loads they carry. We conclude that sensory allometry, but not necessarily body size, is associated with resource exploitation in honeybees and that the differences in number of sensilla may underlie the observed differences in sensitivity between bees specialized on water, pollen and nectar collection. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Division of labor; Pollen syndrome; Response threshold model; Self-organization; Social insects",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952674018

Recent studies have suggested that N. ceranae is more virulent than N. apis both at the individual insect level and at the colony level. Severe colony losses could be attributed to N. ceranae infections, and an unusual form of nosemosis is caused by this pathogen. In the present study, data from a 5-year cohort study of the prevalence of Nosema spp. in Germany, involving about 220 honeybee colonies and a total of 1,997 samples collected from these colonies each spring and autumn and analyzed via species-specific PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), are described. Statistical analysis of the data revealed no relation between colony mortality and detectable levels of infection with N. ceranae or N. apis. In addition, N. apis is still more prevalent than N. ceranae in the cohort of the German bee population that was analyzed. A possible explanation for these findings could be the marked decrease in spore germination that was observed after even a short exposure to low temperatures (+4°C) for N. ceranae only.

Due to the development in agriculture the demands for honey bee pollination are steadily increasing stressing the pollination capacity of the global managed honey bee population. Hence, the long-term decline of managed honey bee hives in Europe and North-America is of great concern and stimulated intensive research into the possible factors presumably causing honey bee colony collapse. We here present a four-year study involving more than 1200 bee colonies from about 120 apiaries which were monitored for the entire study period. Bee samples were collected twice a year to analyze various pathogenic factors including the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor, fungi (Nosema spec., Ascosphaera apis), the bacterium Paenibacillus larvae, and several viruses. Data on environmental factors, beekeeping management practice, and pesticides were also collected. All data were statistically analyzed in respect to the overwintering mortality of the colonies. We can demonstrate for several factors that they are significantly related to the observed winter losses of the monitored honey bee colonies: (i) high varroa infestation level, (ii) infection with deformed wing virus (DWV) and acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) in autumn, (iii) queen age, and (iv) weakness of the colonies in autumn. No effects could be observed for Nosema spec. or pesticides. The implications of these findings will be discussed. © 2010 INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences.","ABPV; colony losses; DWV; Nosema; pesticides; Varroa",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953815337

Within a few years after it was detected in Spain in 2005, the rest of European countries that had technical capacity to differentiate Nosema apis from N. ceranae reported its presence. In a similar way as the initial detection of Varroa in Europe, active scientific work is raising many questions due to the absence of clinical symptoms in infected colonies and a long incubation period of the pathogen. N. ceranae presents a different epidemiological pattern and pathology compared to N. apis. The disease caused by N. ceranae is now named nosemosis type C (COLOSS workshop, 2009) and is characterized by the ability to detect the disease-causing agent throughout the year. The continuous death of highly infected bees, mostly foragers, has a clear effect on colony population and productivity. Although there has been a huge effort in the last years to increase knowledge about this disease, significant research is still needed on epidemiology, pathology, prophyllaxis and treatment. © 2010 INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences.","Apis mellifera; Europe; Nosema apis; Nosema ceranae; nosemosis",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953863103

This study uses a spatially explicit agent based model to determine whether such factors alone can generate biases in task performance at the individual level in the honey bees, Apis mellifera. Specialization (bias in task performance) is shown to result from strong sampling error due to localized task demand, relatively slow moving workers relative to nest size, and strong spatial variation in task demand. To date, specialization has been primarily interpreted with the response threshold concept, which is focused on intrinsic (typically genotypic) differences between workers. Response threshold variation and sampling error due to spatial effects are not mutually exclusive, however, and this study suggests that both contribute to patterns of task bias at the individual level. While spatial effects are strong enough to explain some documented cases of specialization; they are relatively short term and not explanatory for long term cases of specialization. In general, this study suggests that the spatial layout of tasks and fluctuations in their demand must be explicitly controlled for in studies focused on identifying genotypic specialists. © The Author(s) 2010.","Apis mellifera; Division of labor; Response threshold concept; Social insects; Task allocation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861228577

The presence of A. tumida was confirmed in all the colonies surveyed, whereas Oplostomus haroldi Witte (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) was found for the first time to be associated with honey bee colonies in varying numbers at all the sites, except that none were found in colonies in Nairobi. More than 90% of A. tumida and O. haroldi were found in Watamu and Chawia, located within the coastal province of Kenya. Although A. tumida was found mostly on the bottom board of the hives, consistent with previous reports, O. haroldi was found on the frames. Laboratory bioassays using a two-choice olfactometer showed that both beetle species were significantly attracted to worker honey bee volatiles and commercial pollen dough inoculated with the yeast Kodamaea ohmeri associated with A. tumida. Based on these findings, we report for the first time O. haroldi as a pest of African honey bee colonies in Kenya, We propose that differences in their densities recorded in the colonies may be due to dissimilarities in the colony environments in the areas surveyed and that odor-baited traps that have been successfully been used to manage populations of A. tumida also will be suitable for use against O. haroldi. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.","Aethina tumida; Honey bee; Kenya; Kodamaea ohmeri; Oplostomus haroldi",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951981587

Although several compounds have already been described as venom allergens, prominent allergen candidates especially in the higherm.w. range have still remained elusive. Tandem mass spectrometry-based sequencing assigned a candidate gene to the most prominent putative high m.w. allergen Api m 5 (allergen C) in honeybee (Apis mellifera) venom and also allowed identification of its homologue Ves v 3 in yellow jacket (Vespula vulgaris) venom. Both proteins exhibit a pronounced sequence identity to human dipeptidyl peptidase IV or CD26. Reactivity of a human IgE mAb verified the presence of these proteins in the venoms. Both proteins were produced in insect cells and characterized for their enzymatic activity as well as their allergenic potential using sera and basophils from insect venom-allergic patients. Both Api m 5 and Ves v 3 were recognized by specific IgE of the majority of patients even in the absence of cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants. Serologic IgE reactivity closely matched activation of human basophils by Api m 5 or Ves v 3, thus underlining their relevance in functional assays. With Apim5 and Ves v 3, a new pair of homologous allergens becomes available for future clinical applications in diagnosis and therapy that may also contribute to the understanding of molecular mechanisms of insect venoms. Moreover, the patient IgE reactivity together with the cellular activation demonstrates for the first time the relevance of high m.w. allergens in the context of hymenoptera venom allergy.

In order to understand neural networks in the brain it will be necessary, therefore, to understand the connectivity, morphology, and distribution of peptidergic neurons, and to elucidate their function in the brain. In this study we characterize the distribution of substances related to Dip-allatostatin I in the honeybee brain, which belongs to the allatostatin-A (AST) peptide family sharing the conserved c-terminal sequence -YXFGL-NH 2. We found about 500 AST-immunoreactive (ASTir) neurons in the brain, scattered in 18 groups that varied in their precise location across individuals. Almost all areas of the brain were innervated by ASTir fibers. Most ASTir neurites formed networks within functionally distinct areas, e.g., the antennal lobes, the mushroom bodies, or the optic lobes, indicating local functions of the peptide. A small number of very large neurons had widespread arborizations and neurites were found in the corpora cardiaca and in the cervical connectives, suggesting that AST also has global functions. We double-stained AST and GABA and found that a subset of ASTir neurons were GABA-immunoreactive (GABAir). Double staining AST with backfills of olfactory receptor neurons or mass fills of neurons in the antennal lobes and in the mushroom bodies allowed a more fine-grained description of ASTir networks. Together, this first comprehensive description of AST in the bee brain suggests a diverse functional role of AST, including local and global computational tasks. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Apis mellifera; Brain structure; Colocalization; GABA; Neuropeptides; Olfactory system",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949411842

The procedure was applied with linalool, the major component in the extract of Citrus spp. flowers, in order to investigate its bioconversion to linalool derivatives, the major volatiles of citrus honey. Bees were fed daily with 1 L sugar syrup 1:1 (w/v) containing 1 mL of (±) linalool, while control bees were fed with the same amount of linalool-free syrup. The artificial honey was analysed by means of ultrasound-assisted extraction followed by GC-MS analysis. The results show that the formation of both furan and pyran linalool oxides as well as terpendiol I is favoured, probably catalysed by the enzymes secreted by the bee. On the contrary, important linalool derivatives of citrus honey such as lilac aldehydes, cis- and trans-dehydroxy linalool oxides (E)-2,6-dimethyl-6-hydroxy-2,7-octadienal and (Z)-8-hydroxylinalool were absent in the artificial honey, suggesting the requirement of a plant-derived enzyme for their bioconversion. The same stands for (E)-8-hydroxylinalool, major volatile of citrus honey, although small amounts were present in the artificial honey. From these results, it can be concluded that feeding honeybees with linalool-enriched sugar syrup is not an effective way to produce artificial citrus honey similar to the natural one. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","Adulteration; Biotransformation; Honey; Linalool; Linalool derivatives",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952430107

Focusing primarily on Europe and the USA, we review the potential approaches to provide and maintain diverse floral resources for honey bees, giving particular consideration to herbaceous plants (""forbs""). These approaches include the cultivation and maintenance of ""bee pastures"", consisting of diverse native or non-native flower-rich plantings maintained in fallow areas, field margins, and conservation buffer strips to sustain bee populations, support honey bee health, and aid beekeeping activities. Within this review we examine specific governmental policy initiatives to support these efforts in the USA and Europe. © 2010 INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences.","agricultural landscapes; Apis mellifera; beekeeping; environmental policy; flower resources",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953851474

Rhodoleia championii produces lipid-rich pollen grains and dilute nectar (averaging 0.7 mL/d and 9% sugar), with nectar production peaking before 0800 h; the species is self-incompatible and does not set seed asexually. Seven species of nectar-foraging birds visited the inflorescences, with the most common visitors being Japanese white-eyes (Zosterops japonicus, Zosteropidae) and fork-tailed sunbirds (Aethopyga christinae, Nectariniidae). Bumblebees and honeybees played limited roles as pollinators. As documented by fossils from Europe, the Rhodoleia stem lineage dates back at least to the Paleocene. Bird pollination, however, is unlikely to have evolved before the Oligocene when sunbirds arrived in Europe, and pollination by Z. japonicus cannot be much older than 250,000 million years ago, when Z. japonicus diverged from its closest relative. © 2009 The Author(s).

There have been no reports of massive colony losses in Latin America, at least from the symptoms of CCD (colony collapse disorder) or in the proportion and extent of the situations in the US and Europe. We examine possible reasons for the difference, and develop hypotheses that this prevailing good bee health could be due to: (1) the management of generally unselected bees with a certain natural resistance to diseases (tropical regions) or the selection of disease resistant bees (temperate regions); (2) a lower proportion of cropland over the total land area, resulting in more abundant or higher-quality pollen resources for bees; (3) the generally small-scale, low-income and little subsidized agriculture, and concomitant lower use of insecticides compared to industrialized countries. These general parameters may act synergistically, resulting in a large number of configurations across the tremendous ecological, social and economic diversity of Latin America. We suggest that the health of honey bees in Latin America may be ultimately due to the practices of low-income agriculture and beekeeping in the region, leading to more sustainable conditions for the bees. However the increasing trend of land use intensification in some parts of Latin America could lead to declines in honey bee health and population size. © 2010 INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences.","colony losses; disease resistance; genetic diversity; honey bee health; pollen nutrition",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953840206

The number of larvae reared may be reduced to maintain the quality of remaining offspring.

The hypothesis is that, if the males are killed prior to mating, the female varroa population will remain low for an extended period of time. Working with formic acid as the active ingredient, NOD developed a single application, strip formulated, ""sticky"" formic acid vapour release product (Mite-Away Quick Strips™), using saccharides. Mite-Away Quick Strips™ are inserted into the brood rearing area of the colony. The air movement response of the honeybee colony to formic acid vapours is utilized to drive the molecule under the cap, to kill the male varroa. Determining the overall efficacy is a challenge in this model of varroa control. The traditional methods of determining efficacy (positive control comparison of phoretic female varroa kill) will not give a fully accurate efficacy picture. Mite-Away Quick Strips™ are designed for kill under the cap, so looking under the cap was on option. An alternative is an extended trial that monitors the trend of phoretic varroa mites using alcohol wash or a similar method. In 2009, NOD worked with researchers using all three methods. The study presented is a summertime, seven-week post-application, phoretic mite population trend study.

The large majority of these social interactions in a honeybee colony result from food transfer among individuals. Since colony hunger is likely to have a significant influence on these interactions, we investigated its effect on the distribution of food within the colony. By pulsing two colonies having different amounts of stored food with a radioactive label, we found that a starved colony sent out a larger number of foragers, brought in more food, and stored more of it than the satiated colony. We also found that the food brought into a starved colony was distributed more uniformly within each age class than that in the satiated colony. The queen and the young individuals received the lowest exposure to the label even though the label entered different regions of the colony at the same rate. The satiation level of the colony did not influence the relative exposures of different age groups to the label but a higher amount of it was stored in the hungry colony. We discuss the significance of these results in terms of the role played by the organizational structure of the honeybee colony on the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease. © International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI) 2010.","Colony hunger; Food distribution; Honeybees; Radiolabel; Trophallaxis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052468159

In a first experiment, the minimum amount of E. kuehniella eggs needed for optimal development and reproduction was determined to be 40 eggs per individual per 3 days. Then, different amounts of E. kuehniella eggs were offered to individual nymphs, supplemented or not with frozen moist honeybee pollen. Insects reared on only 10 E. kuehniella eggs per 3 days suffered higher mortality, developed slower and had lower adult weights and oocyte counts than insects reared on 40 E. kuehniella eggs or 10 eggs supplemented with pollen. When the nymphs were fed only pollen, survival rates and oocyte production were lower than when both pollen and flour moth eggs were provided. On pollen alone, ca. 80% of the nymphs successfully reached adulthood; their adult weights and oocyte counts were, respectively, 12% and 32% lower compared with individuals fed optimal amounts of flour moth eggs. When an egg yolk-based artificial diet was supplemented with bee pollen, development and fecundity were better than on the artificial diet alone.

After an initial nest phase, workers begin foraging for nectar and pollen, but tend to bias their collection towards one or the other. Although foraging choices of honeybees are influenced by vitellogenin, an egg-yolk precursor protein, workers typically do not lay eggs. The forager reproductive ground plan hypothesis (RGPH) proposes an evolutionary path in which the behavioural bias towards collecting nectar or pollen on foraging trips is influenced by variation in reproductive physiology, such as hormone levels and vitellogenin (vg) gene expression. Recently, the connections between vitellogenin and foraging behaviour were challenged by Oldroyd & Beekman (2008), who concluded from their study that the ovary, and especially vitellogenin, played no role in foraging behaviour of bees. We address their challenge directly by manipulating vg expression by RNA interference (RNAi) mediated gene knockdown in two honeybee genotypes with different foraging behaviour and reproductive physiology. We found that vg affected the food-loading decisions of the workers only in the genotype in which the timing of foraging onset (by age) was also sensitive to vitellogenin levels. In the second genotype, changing vitellogenin levels did not affect foraging onset or bias. The effect of vitellogenin on workers' age at foraging onset is explained by the well-supported double repressor hypothesis (DHR), which describes a mutually inhibitory relationship between vitellogenin and juvenile hormone (JH), an endocrine factor that influences development, reproduction and behaviour in many insects. These results support the RGPH and demonstrate how it intersects with an established mechanism of honeybee behavioural control. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Apis mellifera; honeybee; juvenile hormone; reproductive ground plan hypothesis; RNA interference; social foraging; vitellogenin yolk protein",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950857535

Many pollination studies report inter-annual fluctuations in the composition of pollinators to particular species. However, the factors causing such variation are still poorly understood. Here we investigate how flowering duration and plant and pollinator assemblages influenced the inter-annual changes in the functional generalization level of the 20 most common plant species of a semi-natural meadow in southern Norway. We also studied the extent to which changes in generalization levels were controlled by flower-shape and flowering time. Large inter-annual changes in generalization levels were common and there was no relationship between the generalization level one year and the following. Generalization level of particular plant species increased with flowering duration, sampling effort, and the abundance of managed honeybees in the community. Generalization level decreased with the flowering synchrony between the focal plant species and the rest of the plant community and with the focal species' own abundance, which we attribute to inter-specific competition for pollinator attraction and foraging decisions made by pollinators. Plants with different flower-shapes and flowering times did not differ in the extent of inter-annual variation in generalization levels. Most studies do not consider the effect of the plant community on the generalization level of particular plant species. We show here that both pollinator and plant assemblages can affect the inter-annual variation in generalization levels of plant species. Studies like ours will help to understand how pollination interactions are structured at the community level, and the ecological and evolutionary consequences that these inter-annual changes in generalization levels may have. © 2009 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953113916

An understudied, but significant behavioral disease resistance mechanism in honey bees is their collection and use of plant resins. Honey bees harvest resins with antimicrobial properties from various plant species and bring them back to the colony where they are then mixed with varying amounts of wax and utilized as propolis. Propolis is an apicultural term for the resins when used by bees within a hive. While numerous studies have investigated the chemical components of propolis that could be used to treat human diseases, there is a lack of information on the importance of propolis in regards to bee health. This review serves to provide a compilation of recent research concerning the behavior of bees in relation to resins and propolis, focusing more on the bees themselves and the potential evolutionary benefits of resin collection. Future research goals are also established in order to create a new focus within the literature on the natural history of resin use among the social insects and role that propolis plays in disease resistance. © 2010 INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences.","antimicrobial defense; Apis mellifera; ecological immunity; social immunity",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953851182

However, owing to their intensive use, there exists a debate regarding the involvement of this microbial insecticide in beecolony losses. In this study, inatiered approach using laboratory microcolonies, an evaluation was made of the potential lethaland sublethal hazardson colony reproduction and for aging behaviour of workers of the bumblebee Bombusterrestris (L.) of two commercial Bt strains: kurstaki (Dipel®) and aizawai (Xentari®). Bumblebees, like honey bees, are intensively used in modern agriculture for pollination and fulfil a crucial role in the natural ecosystem. Results: Exposure of bumble bees dermally or viatreated pollen to either of the two Btformulations at their fielder commended rates (0.1%) caused no reduction in survival. However, when applied in the feeding sugar water, aizawai killed all workers at a concentration of 0.1%, but this lethal effect was lost at 0.01%. With respect to reproductive effects, kurstaki was harmless, while aizawai at 0.1% delivered in the feeding sugar water and pollen reduced reproduction by 100 and 31% respectively. Lower doses of 0.01% aizawai in the sugar water showed no more effect. In addition, kurstaki at 0.1% and aizawai at 0.01% in the feeding sugar water did not impair the foraging behaviour, resulting in normal nest colony performance. Conclusion: The results with kurstaki and aizawai demonstrated that, in general, the Bt strains are safe to B. terrestris bumblebees, although in some cases there were detrimental effects that dependedon strain and route of exposure. In addition, the authors believe that to draw firm conclusions regarding the hazards of Bt to bumblebees would require more information on relevant concentrations of Bt products in the environment. Hence, routine testing for lethal and sublethal effects is recommended to ascertain combined use of Bt products and bumblebees in modern agriculture. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.","Aizawai; Bacillus thuringiensis; Bombus terrestris; Dipel®; Foraging behaviour; Kurstaki; Reproduction; Side effects; Survival; Xentari®",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950532447

As honey bees play a vital role in pollination in cardamom, the impact of insecticides on honey bees needs to be explored to assess its safety. Results: Risk assessment based on contact toxicity revealed diafenthiuron to be a non-selective insecticide to bees with a low selectivity ratio (the ratio between the LD50 for beneficial and pest species). A dose of diafenthiuron that killed 90% of cardamom borer, Conogethes punctiferalis Guenee, was found to kill 100% of Indian bees. Based on the hazard ratio (the ratio between the field-recommended dose and the LD50 for the beneficial), diafenthiuron was found to be slightly to moderately toxic to bees. Diafenthiuron, even at low concentrations of LC1 (the concentration that killed 1% of bees), was found to affect the foraging and homing behaviour of Indian bees. Of bees fed with 30 μg mL-1 of diafenthiuron, 40% were found missing on the third day after exposure. However, diafenthiuron did not affect bee visits to the cardamom fields. Conclusion: Diafenthiuron is more highly toxicto Apisceranaindica F. than to C. punctiferalisby contact, using selectivity ratio and probit substitution methods of risk assessment, but the hazard ratio revealed diafenthiuron to be a slightly to moderately toxicchemical. Diafenthiuron was found to affect the for agingand homing behaviour of bees at sublethal concentrations.

The remaining females are helpers called 'workers' that are mostly sterile. A paradigm in studies of eusociality is that worker sterility is a key to societal functions because advanced sociality cannot be achieved when there is conflict over reproduction. Yet, traits such as sensory responsiveness, foraging and hoarding behaviour that change between female reproductive life stages also vary between workers. This variation is central to worker division of labour, a complex social trait believed to be instrumental for the ecological success of animal societies. Thus, we took a step back from established views on worker sterility and societal functions, and hypothesized that division of labour can be better understood if adaptive variation in worker behaviour is seen as emerging from pre-existing mechanisms associated with female reproduction. In exploring this reproductive ground plan hypothesis (RGPH) in honeybee workers, we established that variation in foraging division of labour correlates with ovary size and is affected by expression changes in vitellogenin, an egg yolk protein precursor. Here, we explain and reconcile the RGPH with data on honeybee sensory sensitivity, genomic mapping, transcript and endocrine profiling, and link our discussion with Ihle et al. (2010, this issue, pp. 1001-1006). The findings bring together mechanistic and evolutionary explanations of honeybee worker behaviour.

While most activities in large colonies of social insects have decentralized control, certain activities (e.g., colony migration) can have centralized control, with only a special subset of well-informed individuals making a decision that affects the entire colony. We recently discovered that a small minority of individuals in a honeybee colony-an oligarchy-decides when to trigger the departure of a swarm from its hive. The departure process begins with some bees producing the worker-piping signal (the primer for departure) and is followed by these bees producing the buzz-run signal (the releaser for departure). In this study, we determined the identity of these signalers. We found that a swarm's nest-site scouts search for potential nest cavities prior to the departure of the swarm from its hive. Furthermore, we found that the predeparture nest-site scouts are the sole producers of the worker-piping signal and that they are the first producers of the buzz-run signal. The control of the departure of a honeybee swarm from its hive shows how a small minority of well-informed individuals in a large social insect colony can make important decisions about when a colony should take action. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Buzz run; Group decision making; Honeybee; Oligarchy; Swarming; Worker piping",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952671349

The floral neighborhood of individual plants is part of this immediate environment and affects the frequency and behavior of their pollinators. However, the interactions among plants for pollination might differ among populations because populations differ in floral densities and pollinator assemblages. Despite that, manipulative experiments of the floral neighborhood in different populations with a specific focus on pollinator behavior are still rare. Methods: We introduced mixtures of two species (Salvia farinacae and Tagetes bonanza) in two populations of Taraxacum officinale and examined their effect on pollinators' foraging behavior on Taraxacum. Key results: The effects of the heterospecific neighborhood differed among pollinator groups and between the two populations. Only honeybees consistently preferred both the most diverse (containing three species) and completely pure patches of Tarax acum in both populations. We found a strong and positive effect of patch diversity on visitation to Taraxacum in one population, whereas in the other population either no effect or a negative effect of plant diversity occurred, which we attribute to differences between populations in the ratio of pollinators to inflorescences. Pollinator visitation consistently increased with local Taraxacum density in both populations. Conclusions: Our study shows that a similar local neighborhood can differentially affect the frequency and foraging behavior of pollinators, even in closely situated populations. Experimental studies conducted in several populations would contribute to determine which factors drive the variation in pollination interactions among populations. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.","Competition; Composition of visits; Facilitation; Floral neighborhood; Foraging behavior; Local density; Local diversity; Salvia farinacae; Tagetes bonanza; Taraxacum officinale; Visitation rates",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952363720

An extreme case of an apparently highly specialized plant-pollinator interaction with thigmonastic pollen presentation has been described for the morphologically complex tilt-revolver flowers of Caiophora arechavaletae (Loasaceae) pollinated by oligolectic Bicolletes pampeana (Colletidae, Hymenoptera). We studied the floral biology of Nasa macrothyrsa (Loasaceae) in the field and in the glasshouse, which has very similar floral morphology, but is pollinated by polylectic Neoxylocopa bees (Apidae, Hymenoptera). We investigated the presence of thigmonastic anther presentation, visitor behaviour (pollinators and nectar robbers), co-ordination of pollinator visits with flower behaviour and the presence of nectar replenishment. The aim of this study was to understand whether complex flower morphology and behaviour can be explained by a specialized pollination syndrome, or whether alternative explanations can be offered. The results showed that Nasa macrothyrsa has thigmonastic pollen presentation, i.e. new pollen is rapidly (&lt;&lt; 10 min) presented after a pollinator visit. Nectar secretion is independent of removal and averages 7-14 μL h-1. The complex flowers, however, fail to exclude either native (hummingbirds) or introduced (honeybees) nectar robbers, nor does polylectic Neoxylocopa actively collect the pollen presented. The findings do not support a causal link between complex flower morphology and functionality in Loasaceae and a highly specialized pollination. Rapid pollen presentation is best explained by the pollen presentation theory: the large proportion of pollinators coming shortly after a previous visit find little nectar and are more likely to move on to a different plant. The rapid presentation of pollen ensures that all these valuable 'hungry pollinators' are dusted with small pollen loads, thus increasing the male fitness of the plant by increasing the likelihood of siring outcrossed offspring. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London.","Asymmetric specialization; Hungry pollinator; Nectar replenishment; Pollen presentation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952913694

We identified the sex-determination system of the parasitic wasp Nasonia, which has no csd locus. Instead, maternal input of Nasonia vitripennis transformer {Nvtra) messenger RNA, in combination with specific zygotic Nvtra transcription, in which Nvtra autoregulates female-specific splicing, is essential for female development. Our data indicate that males develop as a result of maternal imprinting that prevents zygotic transcription of the maternally derived Nvtra allele in unfertilized eggs.

For various genomes, the densities of short TR types were shown to differ strongly among different taxa and genomic regions. In this study we analysed the TR characteristics in the genomes of Daphnia pulex and 11 other eukaryotic species. Characteristics of TRs in different genomic regions and among different strands are compared in details for D. pulex and the two model insects Apis mellifera and Drosophila melanogaster.Results: Profound differences in TR characteristics were found among all 12 genomes compared in this study. In D. pulex, the genomic density of TRs was low compared to the arthropod species D. melanogaster and A. mellifera. For these three species, very few common features in repeat type usage, density distribution, and length characteristics were observed in the genomes and in different genomic regions. In introns and coding regions an unexpectedly high strandedness was observed for several repeat motifs. In D. pulex, the density of TRs was highest in introns, a rare feature in animals. In coding regions, the density of TRs with unit sizes 7-50 bp were more than three times as high as for 1-6 bp repeats.Conclusions: TRs in the genome of D. pulex show several notable features, which distinguish it from the other genomes. Altogether, the highly non-random distribution of TRs among genomes, genomic regions and even among different DNA-stands raises many questions concerning their functional and evolutionary importance. The high density of TRs with a unit size longer than 6 bp found in non-coding and coding regions underpins the importance to include longer TR units in comparative analyses. © 2010 Mayer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951586434

In nearly all species, caste is determined by larval nutrition. However, the mechanism that triggers queen development in Melipona bees is still unresolved. Several hypotheses have been proposed, ranging from the proximate (a genetic determination of caste development) to the ultimate (a model in which larvae have complete control over their own caste fate). Here, we showed that the addition of geraniol, the main compound in labial gland secretions of nurse workers, to the larval food significantly increases the number of larvae that develop into queens. Interestingly, the proportion of queens in treated brood exactly matched the value (25%) predicted by the two-locus, two-allele model of genetic queen determination, in which only females that are heterozygous at both loci are capable of developing into queens. We conclude that labial gland secretions, added to the food of some cells by nurse bees, trigger queen development, provided that the larvae are genetically predisposed towards this developmental pathway. In Melipona beecheii, geraniol acts as a primer pheromone representing the first caste determination substance identified to date. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.","Apidae; Caste determination; Geraniol; Hymenoptera; Labial gland secretions; Larval provision; Melipona; Primer pheromone; Social insects; Stingless bees",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953323270

However, such mating biology, typical of many social insects, is also quite challenging to study. Here, we investigate sexual selection in the honey bee that has 2 distinct male morphs (normal sized and small). Males mate only once and females return to their nest after mating, making it possible to measure the lifetime fitness of both sexes. We allowed known numbers of normal-sized males from 6 colonies and small males from another 6 colonies to compete for natural matings with experimental virgin queens. We then determined the mating success of males by genotyping the offspring of these queens. Colonies differed by an order of magnitude in the intrinsic mating success of their males, confirming that the reproductive fitness of honey bee colonies is highly variable. Small males achieved approximately half as many matings as expected given their number of flights and, in addition, had a significantly smaller share of paternity per mating than normal-sized males. Interestingly, the flight activity of small males suggested that they may compensate for their lower competitiveness by flying outside the most competitive mating period in the afternoon. The lower fitness of small males shows that sexual selection is strong in honey bees and contributes to inclusive fitness dynamics that favor worker cooperation within their societies. © 2010 The Author.","Apis mellifera; Male competition; Male size; Paternity; Polyandry",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951105493

Honeybees (Apis mellifera) use optic flow information as an odometer to estimate distance travelled, but here we tested whether optic flow informs estimation of foraging costs also. Bees were trained to feeders in flight tunnels such that bees experienced the greatest optic flow en route to the feeder closest to the hive. Analyses of dance communication showed that, as expected, bees indicated the close feeder as being further, but they also indicated this feeder as the more profitable, and preferentially visited this feeder when given a choice. We show that honeybee estimates of foraging cost are not reliant on optic flow information. Rather, bees can assess distance and profitability independently and signal these aspects as separate elements of their dances. The optic flow signal is sensitive to the nature of the environment travelled by the bee, and is therefore not a good index of flight energetic costs, but it provides a good indication of distance travelled for purpose of navigation and communication, as long as the dancer and recruit travel similar routes. This study suggests an adaptive dual processing system in honeybees for communicating and navigating distance flown and for evaluating its energetic costs. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Apis mellifera; Choice behaviour; Foraging energetics; Odometer; Waggle dance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951431517

It is well-established that parasites can modify hormone signaling of their host, but less is known about the effect of parasites on pheromone signaling in insect societies. We, thus, tested in honey bees (Apis mellifera) the effect of the widespread parasite Nosema spp. on the production of ethyl oleate (EO), the only identified primer pheromone in honey bee workers. Since environmental stressors like pesticides also can weaken honey bees, we also analyzed the effect of imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid widely used in agriculture, on EO production. We show that, contrary to imidacloprid, Nosema spp. significantly altered EO production. In addition, the level of Nosema infection was correlated positively with the level of EO production. Since EO is involved in the regulation of division of labor among workers, our result suggests that the changes in EO signaling induced by parasitism have the potential to disturb the colony homoeostasis. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Ethyl oleate; Honey bee; Imidacloprid; Nosema spp.; Primer pheromone",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952321388

Standardized interviews with farmers assessed agricultural practices in terms of agricultural inputs (nitrogen fertilization and pesticides), livestock density and crop types. The proportion of semi-natural habitats was calculated for each site. We showed negative effects of agricultural intensification on species richness, abundance and diversity of wild bees. By contrast, bee species richness increased with the amount of semi-natural habitats in the landscape. Using a co-inertia analysis, we found an opposition between two types of agricultural specialization: towards crop production or towards animal husbandry. Species richness, abundance and diversity of wild bees were greater in sites turned towards crop production. In these sites, flowering crops provided abundant food resources for bees whereas, in the other group of sites, intensive animal husbandry led to landscapes dominated by forage crops rather than flower-rich permanent grasslands.

Essential oils can be effective in controlling parasitic mites that infest honeybee colonies, but effective encapsulants are needed to provide a sustained and targeted delivery that minimizes the amount of active ingredient used. The present study reports the encapsulation of essential oils in porous microspheres that are within the size range of pollen grains and can be easily dispersed. The microspheres were made by pumping an 8% aqueous high-amylose starch gelatinous melt through an atomizing nozzle. The atomized starch droplets were air-classified into two fractions and collected in ethanol. The size range for each fraction was measured using a particle size analyzer. The mean particle size for the largest fraction was approximately 100 μm with a range from 5 μm to over 300 μm. Part of the reason for the large particle size was attributed to the merging of smaller particles that impinged upon each other before they solidified. The smaller fraction of spheres had a mean particle size of approximately 5 μm. The starch-based porous microspheres were loaded with 16.7% (w/w) essential oils including thymol (5-methyl-2-isopropylphenol), clove, origanum, and camphor white oil. The essential oils appeared to be largely sequestered within the pore structure, since the spheres remained a free-flowing powder and exhibited little if any agglomeration in spite of the high loading rate. Furthermore, SEM micrographs verified that the pore structure was stable, as evidenced by the persistence of pores in spheres that had first been loaded with essential oils and then had the oil removed by solvent extraction. Thermal gravimetric analyses were consistent with a loading rate at predicted levels. © This article not subject to U.S. Copyright.

Recently, evidence has been provided that OBPs are involved in recognition of chemical stimuli. We therefore decided to investigate the expression of OBPs and CSPs in the honeybee at the protein level, using a proteomic approach. Our results are in agreement with previous reports of expression at the RNA level and show that 12 of the 21 OBPs predicted in the genome of the honeybee Apis mellifera and 2 of the 6 CSPs are present in the foragers? antennae, while the larvae express only three OBPs and a single CSP. MALDI mass spectrometry on crude antennal extracts and MALDI profiling on sections of antennae demonstrated that these techniques can be applied to investigate individual differences in the expression of abundant proteins, such as OBPs and CSPs, as well as to detect the presence of proteins in different regions of the antenna. Finally, as part of a project aimed at the characterization of all OBPs and CSPs of the honeybee, we expressed 5 OBPs and 4 CSPs in a bacterial system and measured their affinity to a number of ligands.

One large family of insect neuropeptides are the adipokinetic hormones (AKHs), which mobilize lipids and carbohydrates from the insect fat body. Other peptides are the corazonins that are structurally related to the AKHs but represent a different neuropeptide signaling system. We have previously cloned an orphan GPCR from the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae that was structurally intermediate between the A. gambiae AKH and corazonin GPCRs. Using functional expression of the receptor in cells in cell culture, we have now identified the ligand for this orphan receptor as being pQVTFSRDWNAamide, a neuropeptide that is structurally intermediate between AKH and corazonin and that we therefore named ACP (AKH/corazonin-related peptide). ACP does not activate the A. gambiae AKH and corazonin receptors and, vice versa, AKH and corazonin do not activate the ACP receptor, showing that the ACP/ receptor couple is an independent and so far unknown peptidergic signaling system. Because ACP is structurally intermediate between AKH and corazonin and the ACP receptor between the AKH and corazonin receptors, this is a prominent example of receptor/ligand co-evolution, probably originating from receptor and ligand gene duplications followed by mutations and evolutionary selection, thereby yielding three independent hormonal systems. The ACP signaling system occurs in the mosquitoes A. gambiae, Aedes aegypti, and Culex pipiens (Diptera), the silkworm Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera), the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera), the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis (Hymenoptera), and the bug Rhodnius prolixus (Hemiptera). However, the ACP system is not present in 12 Drosophila species (Diptera), the honeybee Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera), the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (Hemiptera), the body louse Pediculus humanus (Phthiraptera), and the crustacean Daphnia pulex, indicating that it has been lost several times during arthropod evolution. In particular, this frequent loss of hormonal systems is unique for arthropods compared with vertebrates. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951280408

We studied the impact of large scale honeybee imports on managed and wild honeybee populations in Sudan, a centre of biodiversity of A. mellifera, using as set of linked microsatellite DNA loci and mitochondrial DNA markers. The mitochondrial DNA analyses showed that all wild honey bees exclusively belonged to African haplotypes. However, we revealed non-native haplotypes in managed colonies on apiaries reflecting unambiguous evidence of imports from European stock. Moreover, we found significantly higher linkage disequilibria for microsatellite markers in wild populations in regions with apiculture compared to wild populations which had no contact to beekeeping. Introgression of imported honeybees was only measurable at the population level in close vicinity to apicultural activities but not in wild populations which represent the vast majority of honeybees in Sudan. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Apis mellifera; Beekeeping; Competition; Conservation; DNA; Honeybee; Introgression; Microsatellite DNA; Mitochondrial DNA",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954086954

This consisted in isolating or excluding rapeseed plants from pollinators with exclusion cages. Treatments applied were total exclusion (T1), partial exclusion (T2) and free pollination (T0) with a density of 6.5 hives ha-1, in order to determine the following yield components traits: grains per silique, siliques per plant, 1000 grain weight and yield. The experimental design used was randomized complete blocks with three treatments and three replicates. Results obtained show that the parameter least affected by bee intervention was the grains per silique variable. In contrast, siliques per plant and 1000 grain weight parameters presented significant differences, contributing to a yield greater than 5 t ha-1; which represented a figure 50.34% higher than in the treatment without bees.

Oxymatrine and spinosad at the same tested concentrations (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg L-1) significantly inhibited AChE activity in different organs of honey bee workers, and high inhibition percentage was obtained with the enzyme isolated from the thorax. However, chlorfluazuron at 400, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 mg L -1 caused high inhibition of AChE activity isolated from the head (39.65% and 44.22% at 2,000 and 4,000 mg L-1, respectively). In addition, the toxic effects of the tested compounds on activity of ATPase indicated that spinosad caused the highest inhibitory effect in different organs compared with oxymatrine at the same concentrations, and high inhibition was found with ATPase isolated from the head. The results also indicated that oxymatrine was the least active compound for inhibition of AChE and ATPase. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952092391

In many regions of the world, apiculture has come to depend on the use of acaricides, because of the extensive damage caused by varroa to bee colonies. At present, the mite is considered to contribute to the recent decline of honey bee colonies in North America and Europe. Because in tropical climates worker brood rearing and varroa reproduction occurs all year round, it could be expected that here the impact of the parasite will be even more devastating. Yet, this has not been the case in tropical areas of South America. In Brazil, varroa was introduced more than 30 years ago and got established at low levels of infestation, without causing apparent damage to apiculture with Africanized honey bees (AHB). The tolerance of AHB to varroa is apparently attributable, at least in part, to resistance in the bees. The low fertility of this parasite in Africanized worker brood and the grooming and hygienic behavior of the bees are referred as important factors in keeping mite infestation low in the colonies. It has also been suggested that the type of mite influences the level of tolerance in a honey bee population. The Korea haplotype is predominant in unbalanced host-parasite systems, as exist in Europe, whereas in stable systems, as in Brazil, the Japan haplotype used to predominate. However, the patterns of varroa genetic variation have changed in Brazil. All recently sampled mites were of the Korea haplotype, regardless whether the mites had reproduced or not. The fertile mites on AHB in Brazil significantly increased from 56% in the 1980s to 86% in recent years. Nevertheless, despite the increased fertility, no increase in mite infestation rates in the colonies has been detected so far. A comprehensive literature review of varroa reproduction data, focusing on fertility and production of viable female mites, was conducted to provide insight into the Africanized bee host-parasite relationship. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Africanized honey bees; Fertility; Reproductive ability; Resistance mechanisms; Tolerance; Varroa destructor; Viable offspring",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950690164

It is a textbook example of complex behaviour under simple genetic control: hygienic behaviour consists of two components - uncapping a diseased brood cell, followed by removal of the contents - each of which are thought to be modulated independently by a few loci of medium to large effect. A worker's genetic propensity to engage in hygienic tasks affects the intensity of the stimulus required before she initiates the behaviour. Genetic diversity within colonies leads to task specialization among workers, with a minority of workers performing the majority of nest-cleaning tasks. We identify three quantitative trait loci that influence the likelihood that workers will engage in hygienic behaviour and account for up to 30% of the phenotypic variability in hygienic behaviour in our population. Furthermore, we identify two loci that influence the likelihood that a worker will perform uncapping behaviour only, and one locus that influences removal behaviour. We report the first candidate genes associated with engaging in hygienic behaviour, including four genes involved in olfaction, learning and social behaviour, and one gene involved in circadian locomotion. These candidates will allow molecular characterization of this distinctive behavioural mode of disease resistance, as well as providing the opportunity for marker-assisted selection for this commercially significant trait. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Disease resistance; Eusocial; Interval mapping; Microsatellite DNA; Sociogenomics",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949854522

During their development, some insect larvae spin cocoons which, in addition to protecting their occupants against predators, modify microclimatic conditions, thus facilitating thermoregulation or reducing evaporative water loss. Silk cocoons are spun by honeybee (Apis mellifera) larvae and subsequently incorporated into the cell walls of the wax combs in which they develop. The accumulation of this hygroscopic silk in the thousands of cells used for brood rearing may significantly affect nest homeostasis by buffering humidity fluctuations. This study investigates the extent to which the comb may influence homeostasis by quantifying the hygroscopic capacity of the cocoons spun by honeybee larvae. When comb containing cocoons was placed at high humidity, it absorbed 11% of its own mass in water within 4 days. Newly drawn comb composed of hydrophobic wax and devoid of cocoons absorbed only 3% of its own mass. Therefore, the accumulation of cocoons in the comb may increase brood survivorship by maintaining a high and stable humidity in the cells. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Cocoon; Honeybee; Humidity; Larvae; Nest homeostasis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952096465

Large-scale research efforts aim to understand the molecular and social/behavioral mechanisms of energy homeostasis, body weight, and food intake. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) could provide a model for these studies since individuals vary in food-related behavior and social factors can be controlled. Here, we examine a potential role of peripheral insulin receptor substrate (IRS) expression in honey bee foraging behavior. IRS is central to cellular nutrient sensing through transduction of insulin/insulin-like signals (IIS). By reducing peripheral IRS gene expression and IRS protein amount with the use of RNA interference (RNAi), we demonstrate that IRS influences foraging choice in two standard strains selected for different food-hoarding behavior. Compared with controls, IRS knockdowns bias their foraging effort toward protein (pollen) rather than toward carbohydrate (nectar) sources. Through control experiments, we establish that IRS does not influence the bees' sucrose sensory response, a modality that is generally associated with food-related behavior and specifically correlated with the foraging preference of honey bees. These results reveal a new affector pathway of honey bee social foraging, and suggest that IRS expressed in peripheral tissue can modulate an insect's foraging choice between protein and carbohydrate sources. © 2010 Wang et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952399280

We tested for a possible genetic component for a preference of avocado bloom relative to competing bloom. The honey from each hive was extracted at the end of the avocado bloom and the concentration of perseitol, a carbohydrate that is unique to avocado, was analyzed as a measure for avocado foraging. During the first year, five bee strains were compared in three different sites in Israel. Significant differences were found between strains in honey perseitol concentrations, suggesting differences in their efficiency as avocado pollinators, although these differences were site dependent. At two sites, colonies with the highest and lowest perseitol concentrations were selected as parental ""high"" and ""low"" lines, Queens were raised from the selected colonies and were instrumentally inseminated by drones from other colonies of this line, During the second and third years, colonies with inseminated queens were introduced to the avocado orchards, together with the selected colonies still surviving from the previous year. Colonies of the high line had greater perseitol concentrations than those of the low line, Selected colonies that survived from the previous year performed consistently vis - vis perseitol concentration, in the second year of testing. Heritability value of 0.22 was estimated based on regression of offspring on midparent.

This decline is thought to be related to the effects of pathogens or pesticides, although to what extent these factors are implicated is still not clear. In this study, we estimated the prevalence of honey bee colony depopulation symptoms in a random selected sample (n = 61) and we explored the implication of different pathogens, pesticides and the flora visited in the area under study. The prevalence of colony depopulation symptoms in the professional apiaries studied was 67.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 54.6-79.8; P < 0.0001]. The most prevalent pathogen found in the worker honey bee samples was Nosema ceranae [65.6%; 95% CI = 52.8-78.3; P < 0.0001], followed by Varroa destructor [32.7%; 95% CI = 20.2-45.4; P < 0.0001] and 97.5% of the colonies infected by N. ceranae were unhealthy (depopulated). Co-infection by V. destructor and N. ceranae was evident in 22.9% (95% CI = 11.6-34.3; P < 0.0001) of the samples and only in unhealthy colonies. Of the 40 pesticides studied, only nine were detected in 49% of the stored pollen samples analysed. Fipronil was detected in only three of 61 stored pollen samples and imidacloprid was not detected in any. Acaricides like fluvalinate, and chlorfenvinphos used to control Varroa mite were the most predominant residues in the stored pollen, probably as a result of their application in homemade formulae. None of the pesticides identified were statistically associated to colony depopulated. This preliminary study of epidemiological factors suggests that N. ceranae is a key factor in the colony losses detected over recent years in Spain.

Confounding factors not related to climate, however, are also likely to influence genetic diversity and colony densities in honeybee populations. Land use showed a significantly negative influence over genetic diversity and the density of honeybee colonies over all sampling locations. In Europe honeybees sampled in nature reserves had genetic diversity and colony densities similar to those sampled in agricultural landscapes, which suggests that the former are not wild but may have come from managed hives. Other results also support this idea: putative wild bees were rare in our European samples, and the mean estimated density of honeybee colonies on the continent closely resembled the reported mean number of managed hives. Current densities of European honeybee populations are in the same range as those found in the adverse climatic conditions of the Kalahari and Saharan deserts, which suggests that beekeeping activities do not compensate for the loss of wild colonies. Our findings highlight the importance of reconsidering the conservation status of honeybees in Europe and of regarding beekeeping not only as a profitable business for producing honey, but also as an essential component of biodiversity conservation. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.","Apis mellifera; Beekeeping; Ecosystem functioning; Honeybee conservation; Land use; Pollinator decline",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954163250

In this study, we use honey bees as a model system because their queens undergo massive and permanent physiological and behavioural changes following mating. Previous studies have identified changes associated with the transition from a virgin queen to a fully mated, egg-laying queen. Here, we further uncouple the mating process to examine the effects of natural mating vs. instrumental insemination and saline vs. semen insemination. We observed effects on flight behaviour, vitellogenin expression and significant overlap in tran scriptional profiles between our study and analogous studies in D. melanogaster, suggesting that some post-mating mechanisms are conserved across insect orders. © 2009 The Authors.","Behavior; Gene expression; Genomics; Honey bee; Instrumental insemination; Reproduction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952633295

We hypothesized that an invasive mite Varroa destructor, which has caused honeybee decline in NZ, may cause pollinator limitation, so that the additional impact of B. villosus might now reach thresholds for population suppression. We performed manipulative pollination treatments and broad-scale surveys of pollination, seed rain and seed destruction by B. villosus to investigate how pollinator limitation and biocontrol interact throughout the NZ range of broom. The effect of reduced pollination in combination with seed-destruction was explored using a population model parameterized for NZ populations. Broom seed rain ranged from 59 to 21 416 seeds m-2 from 2004 to 2008, and was closely correlated with visitation frequency of honeybees and bumblebees. Infestation of broom seeds by B. villosus is expected to eventually reach 73% (the average rate observed at the localities adjacent to early release sites). The model demonstrated that 73% seed destruction, combined with an absence of honeybee pollination, could cause broom extinction at many sites and, where broom persists, reduce the intensity of treatment required to control broom by conventional means. Nevertheless, seed rain was predicted to be sufficient to maintain broom invasions over many sites in NZ, even in the presence of the varroa mite and B. villosus, largely due to the continued presence of commercial beehives that are treated for varroa mite infestation. Synthesis and applications. Reduced pollination through absence of honeybees can reduce broom seed set to levels at which biocontrol can be more effective. To capitalize on the impact of the varroa mite on feral honeybees, improved management of commercial beehives (for example, withdrawal of licences for beekeepers to locate hives on Department of Conservation land) could be used as part of a successful integrated broom management programme at many sites in NZ. © 2010 The Authors.

In the last years this phenomenon has become increasingly serious, and several hypotheses have been proposed to explain honey bee and colony losses. These hypotheses relate to pests and diseases, pesticides, apicultural practices, climate change, electromagnetic fields, GMO crops, etc. Honey bee colony losses are being surveyed in several European countries, but these surveys are not sufficiently structured. Based on beekeepers' reports, honey bee losses in Italy follow a clear seasonal pattern: a) during spring and summer colonies lose many foragers due to agrochemicals (bee losses); b) from late summer to winter, the impact of pests (including Varroa) and pathogens becomes more important (colony losses). To assess the extent and investigate the possible causes of honey bee and colony losses in Italy a national monitoring network needs to be established. Target apiaries will be distributed in selected-sites (modules), ideally one per region to cover the national territory. Each module, composed of five apiaries- with ten non-migratory colonies each, will be chosen based on environmental characteristics with a distance tojhe center of the module of about 50 km. Colonies will be visually inspected four times a year (right after winter, spring, summer and just before winter).-In each inspection several parameters of each colony will- be'considered-health and nutritional condition, number of bees and brood, and queen's age. The person in charge of each module will input the information obtained in a real-time database available on the Internet. In addition, dead and live bees, as well as several beehive matrices (brood, pollen, wax) will be collected during each inspection for chemical, pollen and disease analyses. The information collected through this honey-bee monitoring network will provide a broad database from which to explore patterns of disease, toxic exposure and management practices that may be linked to the occurrence of honey bee and colony losses.

Extreme polyandry, which lowers relatedness but creates within-colony genetic diversity, produces substantial fitness benefits for honeybee queens and their colonies because of increased disease resistance and workforce productivity. However, the way that these increases are generated by individuals in genetically diverse colonies remains a mystery. We assayed the foraging and dancing performances of workers in multiple-patriline and single-patriline colonies to discover how within-colony genetic diversity, conferred to colonies by polyandrous queens, gives rise to a more productive foraging effort. We also determined whether the initiation by foragers of waggle-dance signaling in response to an increasing sucrose stimulus (their dance response thresholds) was linked to patriline membership. Per capita, foragers in multiple-patriline colonies visited a food source more often and advertised it with more waggle-dance signals than foragers from single-patriline colonies, although there was variability among multiple-patriline colonies in the strength of this difference. High-participation patrilines emerged within multiple-patriline colonies, but their more numerous foragers and dancers were neither more active per capita nor lower-threshold dancers than their counterparts from low-participation patrilines. Our results demonstrate that extreme polyandry does not enhance recruitment effort through the introduction of low-dance-threshold, high-activity workers into a colony's population. Rather, genetic diversity is critical for injecting into a colony's workforce social facilitators who are more likely to become engaged in foraging-related activities, so boosting the production of dance signals and a colony's responsiveness to profitable food sources. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","Intracolonial genetic diversity; Polyandry; Recruitment signaling; Response thresholds; Task allocation; Waggle-dance communication",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950544207

The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-angiogenic effects of a water extract of Brazilian green propolis (WEP) and its constituents, caffeoylquinic acid derivatives, against angiogenic processes in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. We also examined the anti- angiogenic effects of WEP against retinal neovascularization in a murine oxygen-induced retinopathy model in vivo. WEP and its constituents significantly suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced HUVEC proliferation, migration, and tube formation in vitro. WEP and its caffeoylquinic acid derivatives suppressed VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase in HUVECs (versus VEGF alone). Moreover, WEP (300mg/kg/day, subcutaneously for 5 days) significantly suppressed retinal neovascularization in the murine oxygen-induced retinopathy model. These data indicate that (i) WEP has angiostatic effects against angiogenic processes in vitro and in an in vivo model of murine oxygen-induced retinopathy and (ii) the inhibitory effects of WEP against in vitro angiogenesis are chiefly derived from its caffeoylquinic acid derivatives. Judging from these findings, WEP and its caffeoylquinic acid derivatives may represent candidates for preventive or therapeutic agents against diseases caused by angiogenesis. & 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The observation of freely moving adult bees in an arena was used to investigate the role of dopamine signaling in regulating the behavior of the honey bee. Dopamine or the dopamine receptor antagonist flupenthixol was injected into the hemolymph of worker honey bees. Significant differences between treated and control bees were seen for all behaviors (walking, stopped, upside down, grooming, flying and fanning), and behavioral shifts were dependent on drug dosage and time after injection. To examine the role of dopamine signaling through a specific dopamine receptor in the brain, RNA interference was used to reduce expression levels of a D1-like receptor, AmDOP2. Injection of Amdop2 dsRNA into the mushroom bodies reduced the levels of Amdop2 mRNA and produced significant changes in the amount of time honey bees spent performing specific behaviors with reductions in time spent walking offset by increases in grooming or time spent stopped.

We found that the extent of inhibition by amphibian peptides is variable. Whereas MRP-amide inhibited ATPase essentially completely (∼96% inhibition), carein 1.8 did not inhibit at all (0% inhibition). Inhibition by other peptides was partial with a range of ∼13-70%. MRP-amide was also the most potent inhibitor on molar scale (IC50 ∼3.25 μM). Presence of an amide group at the c-terminal of peptides was found to be critical in exerting potent inhibition of ATP synthase (∼20-40% additional inhibition). Inhibition was fully reversible and found to be identical in both F1Fo membrane preparations as well as in isolated purified F1.

However, their function within the motivational system remains unclear. I tested the hypothesis that displacement activities have a functional role during transitions between motivational states, using the honeybee model system. I observed a number of locomotory and grooming behaviours performed when foraging honeybees returned to the hive to dance. These focal behaviours occurred significantly more frequently during the period of transition from waggle dancing to exiting the hive to forage than during the periods before the waggle dance or during the waggle dance. By contrast, the control behaviour, trophallaxis, was distributed across time periods significantly differently, occurring with equal frequency in all periods. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that displacement activities have a functional role during motivational transitions.

It reflects the honeybees' diet and the local plant communities. Honey also shows different plant compositions in different geographical locations. We propose a new method for studying the plant diversity and the geographical origin of honey using a DNA barcoding approach that combines universal primers and massive parallel pyrosequencing. To test this method we use two commercial honeys, one from a regional origin and one composed of a worldwide mix of different honeys. We demonstrate that the method proposed here is fast, simple to implement, more robust than classical methods, and therefore suitable for analyzing plant diversity in honey. © 2010 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","DNA barcoding; Honey; Plant diversity; trnL approach",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957541368

Matsum. and Nak.] fruit yield and quality by optimizing the choice and use of pollenizers. Treatments were pollenizer cultivars planted singly ['Companion', 'Super Pollenizer 1' ('SP1'), 'Summer Flavor 800' ('SF800'), and 'Mickylee'] or in pairs ('Companion' + 'SP1', 'Companion' + 'SF800', and 'SP1' + 'SF800'). All pollenizers from these seven treatments were interplanted with the triploid cultivar Tri-X-313. Planting arrangement was compared by establishing 'SF800' in a hill versus an interplanted field arrangement. Effect of pollenizer establishment timing on triploid fruit yields and quality was evaluated by establishing 'SP1' 3 weeks after planting and comparing it with the establishment of 'SP1' at the time of triploid plant establishment. Finally, a triploid planting with no pollenizer (control) was included to determine pollen movement. Fruit yield from the control was 22% or less of yield of the other treatments containing a pollenizer and less than 10% in the initial or early harvests. Pollen movement was minimal among plots and differences in yield and fruit quality could be attributed to pollenizer treatment. In 2005, the use of 'Companion', 'SP1', or 'Mickylee' as pollenizers produced similar total yields, whereas 'SF800' produced the lowest yield. In 2005, 'Companion' produced more large fruit than the other individual pollenizer treatments. Combining the pollenizers generally did not enhance triploid yields or quality. Interplanting of pollenizers consistently resulted in greater yield compared with the hill system. Late planting of 'SP1' increased the incidence of hollow heart in the marketable fruit and decreased yield compared with simultaneously planting 'SP1' and triploid plants. Thus, selection of pollenizer, planting arrangement, and time of pollenizer establishment are all important considerations to optimizing triploid yield and quality.","Citrullus lanatus; Diploid; Honey bee; Interplant; Plant establishment; Pollination; Seedless; Spacing; Timing",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952075621

The current study aimed to broaden our knowledge on the hexamerin genes found in the honey bee genome by exploring their structural characteristics, expression profiles, evolution, and functions in the life cycle of workers, drones and queens.Results: The hexamerin genes of the honey bee (hex 70a, hex 70b, hex 70c and hex 110) diverge considerably in structure, so that the overall amino acid identity shared among their deduced protein subunits varies from 30 to 42%. Bioinformatics search for motifs in the respective upstream control regions (UCRs) revealed six overrepresented motifs including a potential binding site for Ultraspiracle (Usp), a target of juvenile hormone (JH). The expression of these genes was induced by topical application of JH on worker larvae. The four genes are highly transcribed by the larval fat body, although with significant differences in transcript levels, but only hex 110 and hex 70a are re-induced in the adult fat body in a caste- and sex-specific fashion, workers showing the highest expression. Transcripts for hex 110, hex 70a and hex70b were detected in developing ovaries and testes, and hex 110 was highly transcribed in the ovaries of egg-laying queens. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that HEX 110 is located at the most basal position among the holometabola hexamerins, and like HEX 70a and HEX 70c, it shares potential orthology relationship with hexamerins from other hymenopteran species.Conclusions: Striking differences were found in the structure and developmental expression of the four hexamerin genes in the honey bee. The presence of a potential binding site for Usp in the respective 5' UCRs, and the results of experiments on JH level manipulation in vivo support the hypothesis of regulation by JH. Transcript levels and patterns in the fat body and gonads suggest that, in addition to their primary role in supplying amino acids for metamorphosis, hexamerins serve as storage proteins for gonad development, egg production, and to support foraging activity. A phylogenetic analysis including the four deduced hexamerins and related proteins revealed a complex pattern of evolution, with independent radiation in insect orders. © 2010 Martins et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952298784

In spite of its importance, little is known about the virulence factors secreted by Paenibacillus larvae during larval infection. The aim of the present work was to perform a first approach to the identification and characterization of P. larvae secretome. P. larvae secreted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and identified by MALDI-TOF. Protein toxicity was evaluated using an experimental model based on feeding of A. mellifera larvae and immunogenicity was evaluated by Western blot, using an antiserum raised against cells and spores of P. larvae. Ten different proteins were identified among P. larvae secreted proteins, including proteins involved in transcription, metabolism, translation, cell envelope, transport, protein folding, degradation of polysaccharides and motility. Although most of these proteins are cytosolic, many of them have been previously detected in the extracellular medium of different Bacillus spp. cultures and have been related to virulence. The secreted proteins resulted highly toxic and immunogenic when larvae were exposed using an experimental model. This is the first description of proteins secreted by the honeybee pathogen P. larvae. This information may be relevant for the elucidation of bacterial pathogenesis mechanisms. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study is to develop a potential medicine for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Materials and methods: To this end, first, the MMPs inhibition factor was purified from an alkali-solubilized fraction of RJ (Apis mellifera) by C18 reverse-phase column chromatography and identified as 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10H2DA) by LTQ XL analysis. Next, Experimental test 10H2DA how to inhibited the activities of MMPs: with RASFs isolated from rheumatoid tissues by enzymatic digestion, cultures in monolayers were treated with 10H2DA (0.5 mM, 1 mM, and 2 mM) or PBS for 2 h followed by stimulation with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 2 h, mRNA. Protein levels of MMP-1 and MMP-3 were measured by real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the DNA-binding activity of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and the protein kinase activity of p38, ERK and JNK by kinase assay. Results: The molecular investigation revealed that the 10H2DA-mediated suppression was likely to occur through blocking p38 kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase-AP-1 signaling pathways. In contrast, 10H2DA had no effect on extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity, NF-κB DNA-binding activity and IκBα degradation.

Insects, as a rich source of AMPs, attract great attention of scientists in both understanding of the basic biology of the immune system and searching molecular templates for anti-infective drug design. Despite a large number of AMPs have been identified from different insect species, little information in terms of these peptides is available from parasitic insects.Results: By using integrated computational approaches to systemically mining the Hymenopteran parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis genome, we establish the first AMP repertoire whose members exhibit extensive sequence and structural diversity and can be distinguished into multiple molecular types, including insect and fungal defensin-like peptides (DLPs) with the cysteine-stabilized α-helical and β-sheet (CSαβ) fold; Pro- or Gly-rich abaecins and hymenoptaecins; horseshoe crab tachystatin-type AMPs with the inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) fold; and a linear α-helical peptide. Inducible expression pattern of seven N. vitripennis AMP genes were verified, and two representative peptides were synthesized and functionally identified to be antibacterial. In comparison with Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera) and several non-Hymenopteran model insects, N. vitripennis has evolved a complex antimicrobial immune system with more genes and larger protein precursors. Three classical strategies that are likely responsible for the complexity increase have been recognized: 1) Gene duplication; 2) Exon duplication; and 3) Exon-shuffling.Conclusion: The present study established the N. vitripennis peptidome associated with antimicrobial immunity by using a combined computational and experimental strategy. As the first AMP repertoire of a parasitic wasp, our results offer a basic platform for further studying the immunological and evolutionary significances of these newly discovered AMP-like genes in this class of insects. © 2010 Tian et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952574438

Reflectance and fluorescence emission were analyzed in detail. The fluorescence quantum yield of petals was determined on entire flowers. The obtained values varied from 7.6 × 10-5 to 6.3 × 10-4 for the emission in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum and from 2.4 × 10-5 to 1.9 × 10-4 for the emission in the red one. The fluorescence emission that resulted was negligible compared to the light reflected by the petals, so it was concluded that in this case only reflectance signals should be relevant in biosignal communication with pollinators. In addition, a quantitative estimation of the relative amount of photons absorbed by eye photoreceptors was achieved. Quantum catches were calculated for humans, for honeybees and for a species of bird. Contrasts to background values were also estimated in relation to the ability to detect flowers. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949373389

Propionibacterium acnes plays a critical role in the development of these inflammatory lesions. The present study was conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial property of honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) venom (BV) against the etiologic agents of acne vulgaris. Incubation of the skin bacteria P. acnes, clindamycin-resistant P. acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis or Streptococcus pyrogenes with BV yielded the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Production of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-(TNF-α)) were examined in THP-1 cells. BV MIC values were 0.086, 0.067, 0.104 and 0.121 μg /ml against P. acnes, clindamycin-resistant P. acnes, S. epidermidis, and S. pyrogenes, respectively. In time-kill studies, BV was bacteriostatic in action. In addition, BV exhibited low cytotoxicity at 10 μg /ml in human epidermal keratinocytes and monocytes. In addition, BV reduced the P. acnes-induced secretion of IL-8 and TNF-α in THP-1 cells, an indication of its anti-inflammatory effects. Based on these results, BV has effective antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity against P. acnes, and we suggest that BV is an alternative treatment for antibiotic therapy of acne vulgaris. © 2010 Academic Journals.","Acne; Bee venom; Il-8; Propionibacterium acnes; TNF-α",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951484845

Here the younger bees perform in-hive tasks such as heating and the older ones carry out tasks outside the hive such as foraging. Recently it has been shown that the higher developmental temperatures of the brood, which occur in the centre of the brood nest, reduce the age at which individuals start to forage once they are adult. It is unknown whether this effect has an impact on the survival of the colony. The aim of this paper is to study the consequences of the temperature gradient on the colony survival in a model on the basis of empirical data. We created a deterministic simulation of a honeybee colony (Apis mellifera) which we tuned to our empirical data. In the model in-hive bees regulate the temperature of the brood nest by their heating activities. These temperatures determine the age of first foraging in the newly emerging bees and thus the number of in-hive bees present in the colony. The results of the model show that variation in the onset of foraging due to the different developmental temperatures has little impact on the population dynamics and on the absolute number of bees heating the nest unless we increase this effect by several times to unrealistic values, where individuals start foraging up to 10 days earlier or later. Rather than on variation in the onset of foraging due to the temperature gradient it appears that the survival of the colony depends on a minimal number of bees available for heating at the beginning of the simulation. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Honeybees followed the stationary part of the floor at a given height. On encountering the moving part of the floor, which moved in the same direction as their flight, honeybees descended and flew at a lower height, thus gradually restoring their ventral optic flow (OF) to a similar value to that they had percieved when flying over the stationary part of the floor. This was therefore achieved not by increasing their airspeed, but by lowering their height of flight. These results can be accounted for by a control system called an optic flow regulator, as proposed in previous studies. This visuo-motor control scheme explains how honeybees can navigate safely along tunnels on the sole basis of OF measurements, without any need to measure either their speed or the clearance from the surrounding walls. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","Apis mellifera; Collision avoidance; Image motion; Insect flight; Optic flow",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952243106

We examined undisturbed nests of both species finding that heterospecific workers are present in some nests at low frequency. This suggested that workers may enter heterospecific nests as a prelude to reproductive parasitism. To test this hypothesis, we created mixed-species colonies and determined the reproductive response of workers within them based on molecular markers. In queenless colonies, workers of both species activated their ovaries at equal frequency. However, the majority species, A. florea, had complete reproductive dominance over A. andreniformis, most likely because the A. florea workers recognised and removed heterospecific larvae. In queenright mixed-species colonies, workers responded to heterospecific signals of the presence of the queen and did not activate their ovaries. Thus, despite predictions from kin selection theory that workers would benefit from parasitising heterospecific nests, we find no evidence that selection has established a parasitic strategy in these sibling species. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Apis andreniformis; Apis florea; Brood parasitism; Policing; Worker reproduction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953706731

Dancer bees, however, may indicate many directions within a single dance bout; we show that this scatter in honey bee dances is strongly dependent on the sensory modality used to determine a reference angle in the dance. Dances with a visual reference are more precise than those with a gravity reference. This finding undermines the idea that scatter is introduced into dances, which the bees could perform more precisely, in order to spread recruits out over resource patches. It also calls into question reported interspecific differences that had been interpreted as adaptations of the dance to different habitats. Our results support a non-adaptive hypothesis: that dance scatter results from sensory and performance constraints, rather than modulation of the scatter by the dancing bee.

Apis mellifera is not native to the United States and the first record of this species in the United States was during the early to mid 17th century when European settlers brought it to the United States. The mitochondrial DNA COI-COII intergenic region of A. mellifera exhibits a high degree of genetic variability within and among A. mellifera lineages and is useful for differentiating lineages as well as detecting unique mitotypes. We conducted a study of the genetic diversity of honey bees from central and south central United States from primarily feral populations. Of the 469 samples from 14 states subjected to DNA sequencing we found evidence of four mitotypes from the 'O' lineage: O5, O5d, O5""b, and O2. Only one of these mitotypes, O2, has been previously observed (in Lebanon). Within the feral population, this lineage accounted for 5% of the observed mitotypes. Of the 24 'O' lineage samples mitotype O5 was the most common and accounted for 52% of the total observed 'O' mitotypes. Bayesian and maximum parsimony (MP) phylogenetic analysis revealed that O2, O5, and O5d were more closely related to those found in Libya (O5b, O5a, O4a, O4b), Lebanon (O1b, O2, O3), and Egypt (O1c). However, O5""b appears to have no close relationship to any of the other mitotypes. The existence of the Middle Eastern 'O' lineage in the south central and central United States suggests that further molecular genetic studies of the honey bee population is needed for utilizing and conserving the genetic variation which most likely exists in the Unites States. Furthermore, this study also suggests that feral honey bees are surviving despite the introduction of the varroa mite in the 1980s which reduced the feral and managed populations.","Apis mellifera; COI-COII intergenic region; Middle Eastern honey bee; mtDNA; O lineage",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77349111737

Krause and Vernonia amygdalina Delile, Apis mellifera adansonii Latreille activity was observed on the flowers of these plants in Ngaoundéré from December 2001 to May 2002 and from December 2002 to May 2003. The flowers of each plant species were prospected for at least 4 days per month, between 07.00 and 18.00h, for recording the nectar and/or pollen foraging behaviour of A. m. adansonii workers. Results show that A. m. adansonii harvested the nectar of each plant species. In addition, L. kerstingii and V. amygdalina were visited for pollen. The greatest number of workers foraging simultaneously on a plant varied from 26 (E. sigmoidea) to 4200 (V. amygdalina). Apis mellifera adansonii workers that visited flowers of a given plant species once generally remained with these nectar and/or pollen sources throughout the observation period. Thus C. nigricans, E. sigmoidea, L. kerstingii and V. amygdalina could be cultivated and protected to increase honey production; L. kerstingii and V. amygdalina could enable beekeepers to increase their pollen production as a hive product.

Because of the extremely clinal nature of this honeybee population, we tested the hypotheses that (1) ovarian number and development of the spermatheca covary in Cape workers, and (2) covary clinally as well. A regression analysis revealed that the frequencies of bees with spermathecae significantly decreased from west to east, with Stellenbosch having the highest and Grahamstown the lowest frequencies.

A multiple regression analysis revealed that the number of ovarioles significantly decreased from west to east and also differed significantly between workers with and without a spermatheca.

This ability allows workers to compete with their queen over the maternity of daughter queens and, in one extreme case, has led to a clonal lineage of workers becoming a social parasite in commercially managed populations of A. mellifera scutellata. Previous work (Jordan et al., Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci 275:345, 2008) showed that, in A. mellifera capensis, 59% of queen cells produced during swarming events contained the offspring of workers and that, of these, 65% were the offspring of non-natal workers. Here, we confirm that a substantial proportion (38.5%) of offspring queens is worker-laid. We additionally show that: (1) Although queens produce most diploid female offspring sexually, we found some homozygous or hemizygous queen offspring, suggesting that queens also reproduce by thelytoky. These parthenogenetic individuals are probably nonviable beyond the larval stage. (2) Worker-laid offspring queens are viable and become the resident queen at the same frequency as do sexually produced queen-laid offspring queens. (3) In this study, all but one of the worker-derived queens were laid by natal workers rather than workers from another nest. This suggests that the very high rates of social parasitism observed in our previous study were enhanced by beekeeping manipulations, which increased movement of parasites between colonies. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Social parasitism; Swarming; Thelytoky; Worker reproduction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950544351

From the thousands of drones that are reared in a single colony, only very few succeed in copulating with a queen, and therefore, a strong selection is expected to act on adult drones during their mating flights. In consequence, the gathering of drones at DCAs may serve as an indirect mate selection mechanism, assuring that queens only mate with those individuals having a better flight ability and a higher responsiveness to the queen's visual and chemical cues. Here, we tested this idea relying on wing fluctuating asymmetry (FA) as a measure of phenotypic quality. By recapturing marked drones at a natural DCA and comparing their size and FA with a control sample of drones collected at their maternal hives, we were able to detect any selection on wing size and wing FA occurring during the mating flights. Although we found no solid evidence for selection on wing size, wing FA was found to be significantly lower in the drones collected at the DCA than in those collected at the hives. Our results demonstrate the action of selection during drone mating flights for the first time, showing that developmental stability can influence the mating ability of honeybee drones. We therefore conclude that selection during honeybee drone mating flights may confer some fitness advantages to the queens. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Apis mellifera; Developmental stability; Drone congregation area; Fluctuating asymmetry; Mating flights",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949425443

We identified an Amlac2 gene that encodes a laccase2 in the honey bee, Apis mellifera, and investigated its function in exoskeleton differentiation. The Amlac2 gene consists of nine exons resulting in an ORF of 2193 nucleotides. The deduced translation product is a 731 amino acid protein of 81.5 kDa and a pI of 6.05. Amlac2 is highly expressed in the integument of pharate adults, and the expression precedes the onset of cuticle pigmentation and the intensification of sclerotization. In accordance with the temporal sequence of exoskeleton differentiation from anterior to posterior direction, the levels of Amlac2 transcript increase earlier in the thoracic than in the abdominal integument. The gene expression lasts even after the bees emerge from brood cells and begin activities in the nest, but declines after the transition to foraging stage, suggesting that maturation of the exoskeleton is completed at this stage. Post-transcriptional knockdown of Amlac2 gene expression resulted in structural abnormalities in the exoskeleton and drastically affected adult eclosion. By setting a ligature between the thorax and abdomen of early pupae we could delay the increase in hemolymph ecdysteroid levels in the abdomen. This severely impaired the increase in Amlac2 transcript levels and also the differentiation of the abdominal exoskeleton. Taken together, these results indicate that Amlac2 expression is controlled by ecdysteroids and has a critical role in the differentiation of the adult exoskeleton of honey bees. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, we tested the current hypotheses describing honeybee losses as a multifactorial syndrome, by investigating integrative effects of an infectious organism and an insecticide on honeybee health. We demonstrated that the interaction between the microsporidia Nosema and a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) significantly weak-ened honeybees. In the short term, the combination of both agents caused the highest individual mortality rates and energetic stress. By quantifying the strength of immunity at both the individual and social levels, we showed that neither the haemocyte number nor the phenoloxidase activity of individuals was affected by the different treatments. However, the activity of glucose oxidase, enabling bees to sterilize colony and brood food, was significantly decreased only by the combination of both factors compared with control, Nosema or imidacloprid groups, suggesting a syner-gistic interaction and in the long term a higher suscep-tibility of the colony to pathogens. This provides the first evidences that interaction between an infectious organism and a chemical can also threaten pollinators, interactions that are widely used to eliminate insect pests in integrative pest management. © 2009 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950675074

Social insects can differentiate between nestmates and non-nestmates via recognition cues, which in most species are cuticular hydrocarbons. Cuticular hydrocarbon patterns are altered by genotype and environmental conditions, but it is unclear whether colony social conditions can also affect nestmate interactions. Honeybee queens produce pheromones that regulate many aspects of worker behaviour, physiology and colony organization. A five-component blend, queen mandibular pheromone (QMP), produces many of the effects of a live queen. We found that QMP treatment alters how resident bees interact with intruder bees, based on standard nestmate recognition assays. However, QMP does not appear to alter the ability of bees to distinguish between nestmates and non-nestmates, or general aggression levels. Rather, QMP exposure significantly alters cuticular hydrocarbon patterns of worker bees, suggesting that QMP-treated nestmates are no longer recognized as nestmates by untreated bees, and vice versa. Thus, queen pheromone can have significant effects on nestmate recognition and interactions in honeybees, which may be important for colony cohesion. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","aggression; Apis mellifera; chemical communication; cuticular hydrocarbon; honeybee; social insect",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76449089559

In both species, the first individuals were recorded at those sites with warmer springs and dry summers, at low altitudes, and not covered with dry farming (i.e., cereal crops). The identity and magnitude of the effect of the variables were almost identical for both species and closely mirrored spatial temperature gradients. The best explanatory models accounted for up to half of the variability of appearance dates. Residuals did not show a spatial autocorrelation, meaning that no other spatially structured variable at our working resolution could have improved the results.

The experiment was carried out by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The results showed that there were 200, 242 and 233 proteins in a wide rang of molecular weight (12.42-169.60 kDa) and in a relatively narrow scope of pI (4.50-9.00) detected on day 1, day 2 and day 3, respectively, during the developmental process of the drone egg. Meanwhile, 164 protein spots were resolved at all the images (i.e., the protein was consistently expressed) along with the egg development, among which 7 were significantly up-expressed (P < 0.05) and 4 were significantly down-expressed (P < 0.05) while 79 had no significant differences (P > 0.05). In addition, the specific proteins expressing proteins on day 1, day 2 and day 3 were 11, 18 and 18, respectively. Besides, 17 proteins expressed both on day 1 and day 2 but silenced on day 3, and 43 proteins expressed both on day 2 and day 3 but silenced on day 1, while only 8 proteins expressed both on day 1 and day 3 but silenced on day 2. The results indicate that 2-d-old eggs are at the most active expressional stage in the development of drone egg. The protein expressing at all images suggests that it should be indispensable for drone egg development, but their expression pattern is different. The proteins expressing at a specific age of egg suggest that specific proteins are needed in different developmental stages to regulate. And there are more house-keeping proteins in the developmental process of the drone egg than that of worker egg, and it will provide more targets for gene improvement. © 2010 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.","drone egg; honeybees; proteome; two-dimensional gel electrophoresis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950577127

However, observed recombination rates deviate in some cases from neutral expectations between and within genomes and may play an important role in adaptive evolution. One potentially important argument for an adaptive evolution of recombination rates is the exceptionally high genome-wide recombination rates of social Hymenoptera, in particular the Western honeybee, Apis mellifera. It has the highest metazoan recombination rate reported so far. Proximate or ultimate causes for this elevated recombination rate have not yet been resolved. In a comparative study, we investigated meiotic recombination in the red dwarf honeybee Apis florea. Microsatellite markers developed for A. mellifera were genotyped in a natural mapping population of A. florea. From these genotypes, we calculated local recombination rates, using the physical distances from A. mellifera. In addition to a few comparisons of intervals across the genome, we particularly focused on chromosomes 3 and 12. Confirming marker synteny, we found that recombination rates in A. florea are as high as or higher than those in A. mellifera. Our results are limited to select genomic regions but suggest that A. florea also exhibits an exceptionally high genome-wide recombination rate. This trait may thus occur genus wide. Although our study cannot identify a single explanation for the high rates of recombination in Apis, it favors hypotheses that apply to the entire genus. Furthermore, we conclude that the genome structure of the 2 species has been largely conserved, at least in the parts we investigated. © 2010 The American Genetic Association.

New haplotypes may represent a potential threat to A. mellifera worldwide.

Insect cys-loop LGICs also have central roles in the nervous system and are targets of highly successful insecticides. Here, we describe the cysLGIC superfamily of the parasitoid wasp, Nasonia vitripennis, which is emerging as a highly useful model organism and is deployed as a biological control of insect pests. The wasp superfamily consists of 26 genes, which is the largest insect cysLGIC superfamily characterized, whereas Drosophila melanogaster, Apis mellifera and Tribolium castaneum have 23, 21 and 24, respectively. As with Apis, Drosophila and Tribolium, Nasonia possesses ion channels predicted to be gated by acetylcholine, γ-amino butyric acid, glutamate and histamine, as well as orthologues of the Drosophila pH-sensitive chloride channel (pHCl), CG8916 and CG12344. Similar to other insects, wasp cysLGIC diversity is broadened by alternative splicing and RNA A-to-I editing, which may also serve to generate species-specific receptor isoforms. These findings on N. vitripennis enhance our understanding of cysLGIC functional genomics and provide a useful basis for the study of their function in the wasp model, as well as for the development of improved insecticides that spare a major beneficial insect species. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.","Alternative splicing; Insecticide targets; Ion channels; N. vitripennis; Neurotransmitter receptors; RNA editing",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77149178718

The proportion of beekeepers who did not receive practical recommendations from the Extension Services about the protection and management of Honey bee pastures or honey bees was 94.74% and 93.33% for the first and second periods, respectively. The results showed that there were some incorrect apiculture practices such as throwing wax combs near the bee hives after extracting honey from them (39.39%) or feeding them sheep and cows(42.98%), leaving no sufficient distance between the bee hives and neglecting cleaning bee hives after the mortality of bees at the end of bee season. These factors can increase the chance of infestation with pests directly or indirectly.","Participatory rural appraisal; Tihama plain beekeepers; Yemen",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551490250

Here we review studies on alien bee pollinators, demonstrating the ways in which invasive honeybees and bumblebees affect native plant seed production. Impacts of alien pollinators vary among pollination systems and among components of pollination success (visitation frequency, pollen transfer per visit, and pollen limitation). Reproduction of native bird-pollinated plants is little impacted by alien honeybees, because birds can pollinate even when honeybees visit target flowers. In bee-pollinated native plants, alien honeybee impacts on reproduction may be pervasive, but are not clearly defined in many cases; this lack of clarity arises because very few control sites without invasive bees are available, making comparative evaluation impossible. In bumblebee-pollinated plants, alien bumblebee effects are strong because native and invasive bee species are closely related congeners (of the genus Bombus) with similar pollinator mechanisms; alien bumblebees compete strongly with natives or replace them. In general, morphological, ecological, and behavioral similarities between native and alien pollinators are important for predicting their competitive interaction intensities and their effects on plant reproduction. The impacts of alien bees include (1) decreased pollen transfer per visit because of the loose morphological correspondence between flowers and alien bees, (2) increased competition for floral resources and exclusion of native pollinators because native and alien bees have similar ecological requirements, (3) changes in native pollinator visitation frequency and pollination efficiency caused by particular alien pollinator behavioral traits (such as stealing nectar or collecting previously-deposited pollen from stigmas). For a quantitative evaluation of invasion impacts, it is important to determine whether native plants suffer pollen limitation. To demonstrate pollen limitation, comparative studies with controls (that lack alien pollinators) are required. This approach is essential for discerning possible mechanisms responsible for observed patterns.","Apis; Bombus; Pollen limitation; Seed production; Visitation frequency",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953898710

The success of eusocial insects stems from the presence of specialized castes that undertake distinct tasks. We investigated whether the evolutionary transition to societies with discrete castes was associated with changes in protein evolution. We predicted that proteins with caste-biased gene expression would evolve rapidly due to reduced antagonistic pleiotropy. We found that queen-biased proteins of the honeybee Apis mellifera did indeed evolve rapidly, as predicted. However, worker-biased proteins exhibited slower evolutionary rates than queen-biased or nonbiased proteins. We suggest that distinct selective pressures operating on caste-biased genes, rather than a general reduction in pleiotropy, explain the observed differences in evolutionary rates.

The most common species were Trigona spinipes (Fabricius), Trigona hyalinata (Lepeletier), Apis mellifera (L.) and Melipona quadrifasciata (Lepeletier). The visitation behavior of A. mellifera, M. quadrifasciata, and Bombus morio (Swederus) were similar. They visited flowers for nectar collection, positioning themselves vertically between the corolla and the sexual structures of the flowers, with the back directed toward the floral axis, which permitted the removal of pollen from the anthers of flowers with stamens and its deposition on the stigma of flowers with pistils, being considered therefore effective pollinators. Trigona spinipes and T. hyalinata foraged in groups, preventing other species from landing on the flowers which they occupied. Due to their small body size and only infrequent contact with the sexual structures of the flowers, these species are considered occasional pollinators. The number of fruits produced differed between freely visited flowers, those prevented from receiving visits and those visited only a single time by M. quadrifasciata, B. morio, A. mellifera, T. hyalinata or T. spinipes. Flowers prevented from receiving visits or visited only once by T. spinipes did not produce fruits. The remaining pollination systems led to fruitification, with open pollination or a single visit from either M. quadrifasciata or B. morio leading to most fruit production.","Apidae; Effective pollinator; Foraging behavior; Melittophily; Pollination efficiency",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953530420

On the other hand, HBM displayed significant antinociceptive (p <0.01) and anti-inflammatory (p <0.01) activities at 500mg/kg dose orally without inducing any apparent acute toxicity or gastric damage. HBM was also shown to possess potent antilipidperoxidant activity (p <0.01) at 500mg/kg dose against acetaminophen-induced liver necrosis model in mice. On the other hand, pure honey did not exert any remarkable antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory and gastroprotective activity, but a potent antilipidperoxidant activity (p <0.01) was determined. Results have clearly proved that mixing pure honey with bee pollen significantly increased the healing potential of honey and provided additional support for its traditional use. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents of HBM were found to be 145 and 59.3mg/100g of honey, which were estimated as gallic acid and quercetin equivalents, respectively. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.","Anti-inflammatory; Antinociceptive; Antioxidant activity; Flavonoids; Gastroprotective; Honey; Honey-bee pollen mix; Phenolics",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77249084625

Nevertheless, some parasitic species are able to bypass colony defences. In particular, some beetle nest invaders cannot be killed or removed by workers of social bees, thus creating the need for alternative social defence strategies to ensure colony survival. Here we show, using diagnostic radioentomology, that stingless bee workers (Trigona carbonaria) immediately mummify invading adult small hive beetles (Aethina tumida) alive by coating them with a mixture of resin, wax and mud, thereby preventing severe damage to the colony. In sharp contrast to the responses of honeybee and bumblebee colonies, the rapid live mummification strategy of T. carbonaria effectively prevents beetle advancements and removes their ability to reproduce. The convergent evolution of mummification in stingless bees and encapsulation in honeybees is another striking example of co-evolution between insect societies and their parasites. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Beetles; Diagnostic radioentomology; Parasites; Stingless bee",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949423900

Significant energy losses occur along the stepped chute so that the energy dissipation structure becomes smaller and more economic. In addition, considering the design discharge, downstream face slope, height of spillway, different combinations of spillway width and number of spillway steps may lead to different head losses. In each feasible combination, the remaining head after the steps should be dissipated by downstream energy dissipators. Design and construction of spillways and energy disspators are very cost-consuming and build up a major part of the dam's construction expenses. Thus, the cost of a financially viable stepped spillway project that consists of the steps' cost and downstream dissipator's cost should be minimised. In this paper, the honey-bee mating optimisation (HBMO) algorithm is used to determine the best combination of design variables so as to minimise the total cost of both spillway chute and stilling basin. Results are compared with those previously obtained by genetic algorithm (GA) and show the promising potential of the HBMO algorithm in this field of application. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Honey-bee mating optimisation (HBMO) algorithm; Optimum design; Stepped spillway",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76749154555

In insects most closely related to branchiopod crustaceans, orthologs of the Drosophila transformer gene such as dipteran transformer (tra), honeybee feminizer (fem) and complementary sex determiner (csd) function as sex determining factors. Therefore, we cloned a D. magna transformer gene (dmagtra) and analyzed its expression. The predicted amino acid sequence has 380 amino acids including an arginine-serine-rich region, which is characteristic of insect orthologs of Tra. Residues 180 to 205 are highly conserved with known Tra orthologs. The domain organization of DmagTra is distinct from known Tra orthologs; moreover, dmagtra does not display any detectable sexual dimorphic differences in expression or splicing patterns.

The first model represents a swarm of bees deciding whether a site is viable, and the second characterizes its ability to select between two viable sites. We find that the one-site assessment process has two equilibrium states: a disinterested equilibrium (DE) in which the bees show no interest in the site and an interested equilibrium (IE) in which bees show interest. In analogy with epidemic models, we define basic and absolute recruitment numbers (R0 and B0) as measures of the swarm's sensitivity to dancing by a single bee. If R0 is less than one then the DE is locally stable, and if B0 is less than one then it is globally stable. If R0 is greater than one then the DE is unstable and the IE is stable under realistic conditions. In addition, there exists a critical site quality threshold Q* above which the site can attract some interest (at equilibrium) and below which it cannot. We also find the existence of a second critical site quality threshold Q** above which the site can attract a quorum (at equilibrium) and below which it cannot. The two-site discrimination process, in which we examine a swarm's ability to simultaneously consider two sites differing in both site quality and discovery time, has a stable DE if and only if both sites' individual basic recruitment numbers are less than one. Numerical experiments are performed to study the influences of site quality on quorum time and the outcome of competition between a lower quality site discovered first and a higher quality site discovered second. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Apis mellifera; Basic recruitment number; Honey bee; Honeybee; Mathematical model; Nest-site selection; Swarm",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77649333820

We used various biochemical, molecular and BLAST search techniques to detect these signaling molecules in representatives of diverse arthropods. Using peptide isolation from tracheal extracts, cDNA cloning or homology searches, we identified ETHs in a variety of hemimetabolous and holometabolous insects. Most insects produce two related ETHs, but only a single active peptide was isolated from the cricket and one peptide is encoded by the eth gene of the honeybee, parasitic wasp and aphid. Immunohistochemical staining with antiserum to Manduca PETH revealed Inka cells on tracheal surface of diverse insects. In spite of conserved ETH sequences, comparison of natural and the ETH-induced ecdysis sequence in the honeybee and beetle revealed considerable species-specific differences in pre-ecdysis and ecdysis behaviors. DNA sequences coding for putative ETHR were deduced from available genomes of several hemimetabolous and holometabolous insects. In all insects examined, the ethr gene encodes two subtypes of the receptor (ETHR-A and ETHR-B). Phylogenetic analysis showed that these receptors fall into a family of closely related GPCRs. We report for the first time the presence of putative ETHs and ETHRs in genomes of other arthropods, including the tick (Arachnida) and water flea (Crustacea). The possible source of ETH in ticks was detected in paired cells located in all pedal segments.

So far no studies exist, which investigated the influence of the sulfur nutritional status on the emission of volatiles by other agricultural plants during flowering. In the present study the influence of the sulfur supply on the floral scent of crops with (white mustard, oil radish) and without sulfur-containing secondary compounds (chamomile, field beans, and peas) was determined. The plant sulfur status was monitored at the start of main growth and the volatile emissions of flowers were characterized three times during main flowering by employing an electronic nose. Sulfur fertilization increased the sulfur content in leaves and flowers of all crops. Significant differences in the emission of volatiles in relation to sulfur fertilization were determined at least at one sampling date for all investigated crops except white mustard.

Here, we tested the hypotheses that (i) the invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera outcompetes native plant communities for pollinators, and (ii) pollinator abundances depend on landscape structure, but are modulated by this mass-flowering invader. We selected 14 study sites in riparian habitats along a landscape gradient with decreasing proportion of natural land cover. Within each site paired invaded or non-invaded plots were studied. We performed standardized surveys of pollinators and established experimental plots by adding the native plant Raphanus sativus to assess the impact of I. glandulifera on visitation rates and seed set. Impatiens glandulifera was well integrated in the plant-pollinator network, being visited by several native pollinators, mainly bumblebees. The invader received higher visitation rates than simultaneously flowering native riparian plants and the experimentally added native R. sativus. However, visitation rates to the native plant community showed no significant differences between invaded and non-invaded plots, with the exception of honeybees, which slightly increased their visits in invaded plots. With regard to the experimental setting, the presence of I. glandulifera reduced bumblebee visitation to R. sativus pots, but had no significant effects on seed set. We found enhanced visitation rates of bumblebees in intensively used agricultural landscapes. However, in the presence of I. glandulifera this landscape effect was masked by bumblebees being highly attracted to I. glandulifera stands independent of the structure of the surrounding landscape. Surprisingly, wild bees and hoverflies were not affected by landscape structure, but, as also the case with bumblebees, they were principally affected by the immediate community flower abundance. Synthesis. Our data provide no evidence that I. glandulifera outcompetes native plants for pollinators. However, social bees were very attracted to this late-seasonal floral resource. We conclude that both, plant invasions and landscape structure have important effects on the plant-pollinator community studied, but that they operate at different stages of the flowering season. © 2010 The Authors.

Here, we have analyzed the brain composition of honey bees (Apis mellifera) that have been individually tested in an olfactory learning paradigm. We found that the total brain size correlated with the bees' learning performance. Among different brain components, only the mushroom body, a structure known to be involved in learning and memory, showed a positive correlation with learning performance. In contrast, visual neuropils were relatively smaller in bees that performed better in the olfactory learning task, suggesting modality-specific behavioral specialization of individual bees. This idea is also supported by inter-individual differences in brain composition. Some slight yet statistically significant differences in the brain composition of European and Africanized honey bees are reported. Larger bees had larger brains, and by comparing brains of different sizes, we report isometric correlations for all brain components except for a small structure, the central body. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Africanized bees; Brain size; Mushroom body",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950690923

Its main risk factors are disorders associated with metabolic syndrome (MS). Propolis, a resinous substance produced by Apis mellifera to protect is hive, has demonstrated a hepatoprotective effect. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Chilean propolis on development of nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis in C57BL/6J mice exposed to Paigen atherogenic diet. Twenty eight mice C57BL/6J were divided four groups: 1, balanced diet (CH); 2, hypercholesterolemic diet (HD); 3, HD diet supplemented with 10 mg/kg/day of propolis (LP); 4, HD diet supplemented with 40 mg/kg/day of propolis (HP). After 16 weeks of treatment was determined glucose, total cholesterol and triglycerides concentrations and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity. The liver tissue was fixed in 10% buffered formalin solution, embedded in paraplast and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. No differences was detected in glucose and triglycerides concentrations, contrasting with total cholesterol levels between group fed with a balanced diet (CH) and feed with atherogenic diet D12336 (HD, LP and HP). In the same way, it was noted differences in ALT activity between groups, standing out the reduction in propolis supplemented groups (LP and HP). Likewise the histoarchitecture of HD group, showed simple steatosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory foci in hepatic lobule. This characteristics show a gradual decrease in LP and HP groups. In conclusion, the Chilean propolis analyzed decreases hepatic steatosis induced by atherogenic diet in C57BL/6J mice.

Honey bees use positive feedback from the waggle dance to allocate colony foraging effort. However, the use of negative feedback signals by superorganisms is poorly understood. I show that conspecific attacks at a food source lead to the production of stop signals, communication that was known to reduce waggle dancing and recruitment but lacked a clear natural trigger. Signalers preferentially targeted nestmates visiting the same food source, on the basis of its odor. During aggressive food competition, attack victims increased signal production by 43 fold. Foragers that attacked competitors or experienced no aggression did not alter signal production. Biting ambush predators also attack foragers at flowers. Simulated biting of foragers or exposure to bee alarm pheromone also elicited signaling (88-fold and 14-fold increases, respectively). This provides the first clear evidence of a negative feedback signal elicited by foraging peril to counteract the positive feedback of the waggle dance. As in intra- and intercellular communication, negative feedback may play an important, though currently underappreciated, role in self-organizing behaviors within superorganisms. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To analyze molecular and neural bases that underlie the visual abilities of the honeybees, we used a cDNA microarray to search for gene(s) expressed in a neural cell-type preferential manner in a visual center of the honeybee brain, the optic lobes (OLs). Methodology/Principal Findings: Expression analysis of candidate genes using in situ hybridization revealed two genes expressed in a neural cell-type preferential manner in the OLs. One is a homologue of Drosophila futsch, which encodes a microtubule-associated protein and is preferentially expressed in the monopolar cells in the lamina of the OLs. The gene for another microtubule-associated protein, tau, which functionally overlaps with futsch, was also preferentially expressed in the monopolar cells, strongly suggesting the functional importance of these two microtubule-associated proteins in monopolar cells. The other gene encoded a homologue of Misexpression Suppressor of Dominant-negative Kinase Suppressor of Ras 2 (MESK2), which might activate Ras/MAPK-signaling in Drosophila. MESK2 was expressed preferentially in a subclass of neurons located in the ventral region between the lamina and medulla neuropil in the OLs, suggesting that this subclass is a novel OL neuron type characterized by MESK2-expression. These three genes exhibited similar expression patterns in the worker, drone, and queen brains, suggesting that they function similarly irrespective of the honeybee sex or caste. Conclusions: Here we identified genes that are expressed in a monopolar cell (Amfutsch and Amtau) or ventral medulla-preferential manner (AmMESK2) in insect OLs. These genes may aid in visualizing neurites of monopolar cells and ventral medulla cells, as well as in analyzing the function of these neurons. © 2010 Kaneko et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949528800

This species is extensively used for commercial pollination in Europe, and along with other Bombus spp. is a key member of natural pollinator assemblages. Furthermore, the species is studied in a wide variety of biological fields. The objective of this project was to create a B. terrestris EST resource that will prove to be valuable in obtaining a deeper understanding of this significant social insect.Results: A normalised cDNA library was constructed from the thorax and abdomen of B. terrestris workers in order to enhance the discovery of rare genes. A total of 29'428 ESTs were sequenced. Subsequent clustering resulted in 13'333 unique sequences. Of these, 58.8 percent had significant similarities to known proteins, with 54.5 percent having a ""best-hit"" to existing Hymenoptera sequences. Comparisons with the honeybee and other insects allowed the identification of potential candidates for gene loss, pseudogene evolution, and possible incomplete annotation in the honeybee genome. Further, given the focus of much basic research and the perceived threat of disease to natural and commercial populations, the immune system of bumblebees is a particularly relevant component. Although the library is derived from unchallenged bees, we still uncover transcription of a number of immune genes spanning the principally described insect immune pathways. Additionally, the EST library provides a resource for the discovery of genetic markers that can be used in population level studies. Indeed, initial screens identified 589 simple sequence repeats and 854 potential single nucleotide polymorphisms.Conclusion: The resource that these B. terrestris ESTs represent is valuable for ongoing work. The ESTs provide direct evidence of transcriptionally active regions, but they will also facilitate further functional genomics, gene discovery and future genome annotation.

Furthermore, we studied whether, irrespective of their capacity to distinguish between facelike stimuli, bees learn to classify visual stimuli built up of the same elements in face-like versus non-face-like categories. We showed that bees succeeded in discriminating both face-like and non-face-like stimuli and categorized appropriately novel stimuli in these two classes. To this end, they used configurai information and not just isolated features or low-level cues. Bees looked for a specific configuration in which each feature had to be located in an appropriate spatial relationship with respect to the others, thus showing sensitivity for first-order relationships between features.

However, the molecular factors associated with individual variation in social behavior remain relatively unexplored. We used honey bees (Apis mellifera) as a model to examine differences in socially-regulated behavior among individual workers, and used transcriptional profiling to determine if specific gene expression patterns are associated with these individual differences. In honey bees, the reproductive queen produces a pheromonal signal that regulates many aspects of worker behavior and physiology and maintains colony organization. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we demonstrate that there is substantial natural variation in individual worker attraction to queen pheromone (QMP). Furthermore, worker attraction is negatively correlated with ovariole number - a trait associated with reproductive potential in workers. We identified transcriptional differences in the adult brain associated with individual worker attraction to QMP, and identified hundreds of transcripts that are organized into statistically-correlated gene networks and associated with this response. Conclusions/Significance:Our studies demonstrate that there is substantial variation in worker attraction to QMP among individuals, and that this variation is linked with specific differences in physiology and brain gene expression patterns. This variation in individual response thresholds may reveal underlying variation in queen-worker reproductive conflict, and may mediate colony function and productivity by creating variation in individual task performance. © 2010 Kocher et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949349089

These binding partners produce a trans-synaptic bridge that facilitates maturation and specification of synapses. It is believed that there exists an optimal spatio-temporal code of neurexin and neuroligin interactions that guide synapse formation in the postnatal developing brain. Therefore, we investigated whether neuroligins and neurexin are differentially regulated by sensory input using a behavioural model system with an advanced capacity for sensory processing, learning and memory, the honeybee. Methodology/Principal Findings: Whole brain expression levels of neuroligin 1-5 (NLG1-5) and neurexin I (NrxI) were estimated by qRT-PCR analysis in three different behavioural paradigms: sensory deprivation, associative scent learning, and lateralised sensory input. Sensory deprived bees had a lower level of NLG1 expression, but a generally increased level of NLG2-5 and NrxI expression compared to hive bees. Bees that had undergone associative scent training had significantly increased levels of NrxI, NLG1 and NLG3 expression compared to untrained control bees. Bees that had lateralised sensory input after antennal amputation showed a specific increase in NLG1 expression compared to control bees, which only happened over time. Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that (1) there is a lack of synaptic pruning during sensory deprivation; (2) NLG1 expression increases with sensory stimulation; (3) concomitant changes in gene expression suggests NrxI interacts with all neuroligins; (4) there is evidence for synaptic compensation after lateralised injury. © 2010 Biswas et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949373332

Most of these odours are floral scents, which are mixtures of dozens of different odorants. To date, it is still1 unclear how the bee brain unravels the complex information contained in scent mixtures. Methodology/Principal Findings:This study investigates learning of complex odour mixtures in honeybees using a simple olfactory conditioning procedure, the Proboscis-Extension-Reflex (PER) paradigm. Restrained honeybees were trained to three scent mixtures composed of 14 floral odorants each, and then tested with the individual odorants of each mixture. Bees did not respond to all odorants of a mixture equally: They responded well to a selection of key odorants, which were unique for each of the three scent mixtures. Bees showed less or very little response to the other odorants of the mixtures. The bees' response to mixtures composed of only the key odorants was as good as to the original mixtures of 14 odorants. A mixture composed of the other, non-key-odorants elicited a significantly lower response. Neither an odorant's volatility or molecular structure, nor learning efficiencies for individual odorants affected whether an odorant became a key odorant for a particular mixture. Odorant concentration had a positive effect, with odorants at high concentration likely to become key odorants. Conclusions/Significance: Our study suggests that the brain processes complex scent mixtures by predominantly learning information from selected key odorants. Our observations on key odorant learning lend significant support to previous work on olfactory learning and mixture processing in honeybees. © 2010 Reinhard et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949353764

Cell culture systems for bees solves an impasse that has hindered efforts to isolate and screen pathogens which may be influencing or causing colony collapse disorder of bees.

BlastP searching revealed a strong identity with only two proteins from other insect species: the jewel wasp, Nasonia vitripennis (Hymenoptera), and the green pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Hemiptera). In higher organisms, C1q is the first subcomponent of the classical complement pathway and constitutes a major link between innate and acquired immunity.

The role that honey bee primer pheromones play in the functional physiology of food producing glands was examined. The combined and separate effects of queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) and brood pheromone (BP) on amount of protein extractable from hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands of workers reared for 12 days with and without pollen diets was measured. In rearing environments with a pollen diet, BP, and QMP + BP pheromone treatments significantly increased extractable protein from both glands. Bees reared with QMP + pollen had amounts of protein extractable from both glands that were not significantly different from control bees (no pheromones, no pollen). Pollen in the diet alone significantly increased amounts of protein extractable from glands versus control. In rearing environments without pollen, QMP + BP had a synergizing effect on amount of protein in both glands. The QMP + BP treatment was the only rearing environment without a pollen diet where protein amounts were significantly greater than the control. The synergizing effect of QMP + BP on extractable mandibular and hypopharyngeal gland protein suggests a highly derived role for the combined effect of these two primer pheromones on honey bee cooperative brood care. Mandibular gland area was significantly and positively correlated with extractable protein. Amounts of extractable protein from both glands declined significantly with age of workers in all treatments. However, treatment significantly affected rate of decline. The adaptive significance of gland protein amounts in response to pheromones and pollen diet are discussed. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The colony density, abundance and nesting sites of these species varied significantly between different habitats. Though wild honeybees share common food plants, but their nesting niche is different. However, due to intensive man-made activities at different nesting habitats and on the foraging plants, the small honey bees namely A. florea and T. iridipennis population is declining at various agro-ecosystems. Since, the foraging range of A. florea and T. iridipennis is small; they nest at lower elevations on small to medium sized trees or shrubs compared to A. dorsata. As a result, A. florae and T. iridipennis becomes easily victim to man-made activities.

We performed comparative analyses of Nasonia tRNA genes with honey bee and other selected insects to understand genomic distribution, sequence evolution and relationship of tRNA copy number with codon usage patterns. Many tRNA genes are located physically close to each other in the form of small clusters in the Nasonia genome. However, the number of clusters and the tRNA genes that form such clusters vary from species to species. In particular, the Ala-, Pro-, Tyr- and His-tRNA genes tend to accumulate in clusters in Nasonia but not in honey bee, whereas the bee contains a long cluster of 15 tRNA genes (of which 13 are Gln-tRNAs) that is absent in Nasonia. Though tRNA genes are highly conserved, contrasting patterns of nucleotide diversity are observed among the arm and loop regions of tRNAs between Nasonia and honey bee. Also, the sequence convergence between the reconstructed ancestral tRNAs and the present day tRNAs suggests a common ancestral origin of Nasonia and honey bee tRNAs. Furthermore, we also present evidence that the copy number of isoacceptor tRNAs (those having a different anticodon but charge the same amino acid) is correlated with codon usage patterns of highly expressed genes in Nasonia. © 2010 The Royal Entomological Society.","Anticodon; Codon usage; Gene cluster; Isoacceptor; Sequence divergence",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75649098217

Beekeepers have relied on the pyrethroid pesticide tau-fluvalinate as a principal agent of varroa mite control. While this miticide was quite effective at controlling varroa mites through the 1990s, its efficacy has waned as resistance to tau-fluvalinate has appeared in many populations of mites. Resistance in some populations of varroa mites has been associated with elevated detoxification of tau-fluvalinate. Honey bees tolerate miticidal tau-fluvalinate applications principally through rapid detoxification mediated by cytochrome-P450 mono-oxygenases, with the other detoxification enzyme families, the carboxylesterases and glutathione-S-transferases, playing much smaller roles in miticide tolerance. The goal of this study was to test the capability of the glutathione-S-transferase enzyme inhibitors diethyl maleate and curcumin, which should interfere minimally with honey bee detoxification, to elevate the toxicity of tau-fluvalinate to a population of varroa mites. Additionally, to test the role of cytochrome P450s and esterases in any detoxification-mediated resistance, varroa mites were also treated with the enzyme inhibitors piperonyl butoxide and S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate. None of the tested enzyme inhibitors increased the toxicity of tau-fluvalinate, suggesting that detoxification plays a minimal role in the tolerance of tau-fluvalinate in the population of varroa mites in this study. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Apis mellifera; Curcumin; Cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase; Glutathione-S-transferase; Pesticide resistance; Pyrethroid; Varroa",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949566061

In the present study, we analyzed the kairomonal response of this wasp to the male-produced sex pheromone of a host, the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella, an economically important pest of honeybees, Apis mellifera. Coupled gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) revealed three compounds in headspace collections from male G. mellonella that elicited responses from B. hebetor antennae: decanal and the previously identified sex pheromone components, nonanal and undecanal. Y-tube olfactometer tests that used naïve, mated wasps showed that females, but not males, were highly attracted to (a) male G. mellonella headspace samples, (b) two synthetic blends of nonanal and undecanal (in ratios matching that found in male moth samples), and (c) the two aldehydes tested individually. Further, female wasps did not discriminate between a blend of aldehydes and male G. mellonella headspace. In dose-response trials that used octanal, nonanal, decanal, and undecanal, no difference in EAG responses of the two sexes was observed, except for undecanal at the second highest dose, for which female antennae showed significantly larger responses than did male antennae.

These pests are extremely polyphagous with a wide host range. Chemical control is made difficult due to resistance and pollution, and other side-effects are associated with insecticide use. Consequently, there is much interest in maximising the role of biological control in the management of these sap-sucking insect pests. This study aimed to evaluate companion cropping alongside cucurbit crops in a tropical setting as a means to increase the populations of beneficial insects and spiders so as to control the major sap-sucking insect pests. The population of beneficial and harmful insects, with a focus on SLW and aphids, and other invertebrates were sampled weekly on four different crops which could be used for habitat manipulation: Goodbug Mix (GBM; a proprietary seed mixture including self-sowing annual and perennial herbaceous flower species); lablab (Lablab purpureus L. Sweet); lucerne (Medicago sativa L.); and niger (Guizotia abyssinica (L.f.) Cass.). Lablab hosted the highest numbers of beneficial insects (larvae and adults of lacewing (Mallada signata (Schneider)), ladybird beetles (Coccinella transversalis Fabricius) and spiders) while GBM hosted the highest numbers of European bees (Apis mellifera Linnaeus) and spiders. Lucerne and niger showed little promise in hosting beneficial insects, but lucerne hosted significantly more spiders (double the numbers) than niger. Lucerne hosted sig-nificantly more of the harmful insect species of aphids (Aphis gossypii (Glover)) and Myzus persicae (Sulzer)) and heliothis (Heliothis armigera Hbner). Niger hosted significantly more vegetable weevils (Listroderes difficillis (Germar)) than the other three species. Therefore, lablab and GBM appear to be viable options to grow within cucurbits or as field boundary crops to attract and increase beneficial insects and spiders for the control of sap-sucking insect pests. Use of these bio-control strategies affords the opportunity to minimise pesticide usage and the risks associated with pollution. © 2009 Cambridge University Press.","Goodbug mix; Invertebrates; Lablab; Lucerne; Niger; Polyphagous; Resistance; Silverleaf",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949687624

Structures of melittin determined either in lipid environments by NMR or by use of X-ray demonstrated two helical regions at the N- and C-termini connected by a hinge or a bend at the middle. Here, we show that deletion of the hinge residues along with two C-terminal terminal Gln residues (Q25 and Q26), yielding a peptide analog of 19-residue or Mel-H, did not affect antibacterial activity but resulted in a somewhat reduced hemolytic activity. A diastereomer of Mel-H or Mel-dH containing d-amino acids [dV5, dV8, dL11 and dK16] showed further reduction in hemolytic activity without lowering antibacterial activity. We have carried out NMR structures, dynamics (H-D exchange and proton relaxation), membrane localization by spin labeled lipids, pulse-field-gradient (PFG) NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles, as a mimic to eukaryotic membrane, to gain insights into cell selectivity of these melittin analogs. PFG-NMR showed Mel-H and Mel-dH both were similarly partitioned into DPC micelles. ITC demonstrated that Mel-H and Mel-dH interact with DPC with similar affinity. The micelle-bound structure of Mel-H delineated a straight helical conformation, whereas Mel-dH showed multiple β-turns at the N-terminus and a short helix at the C-terminus. The backbone amide-proton exchange with solvent D2O demonstrated a large difference in dynamics between Mel-H and Mel-dH, whereby almost all backbone protons of Mel-dH showed a much faster rate of exchange as compared to Mel-H. Proton T1 relaxation had suggested a mobile backbone of Mel-dH peptide in DPC micelles. Resonance perturbation by paramagnetic lipids indicated that Mel-H inserted deeper into DPC micelles, whereas Mel-dH is largely located at the surface of the micelle. Taken together, results presented in this study demonstrated that the poor hemolytic activity of the d-amino acid containing analogs of antimicrobial peptides may be correlated with their flexible dynamics at the membrane surface. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV), Orgyia anartoides NPV (OranNPV), originally isolated from PAM in Australia, was tested for its pathogenicity to PAM and a range of non-target insect species found in New Zealand, to evaluate its suitability as a microbial control for this insect invader. Dosage-mortality tests showed that OranNPV was highly pathogenic to PAM larvae; mean LT50 values for third instars ranged from 17.9 to 8.1 days for doses from 102 to 105 polyhedral inclusion bodies/larva, respectively. The cause of death in infected insects was confirmed as OranNPV. Molecular analysis established that OranNPV can be identified by PCR and restriction digestion, and this process complemented microscopic examination of infected larvae. No lymantriid species occur in New Zealand; however, the virus had no significant effects on species from five other lepidopteran families (Noctuidae, Tortricidae, Geometridae, Nymphalidae and Plutellidae) or on adult honeybees. Thus, all indications from this initial investigation are that OranNPV would be an important tool in the control of PAM in a future incursion of this species into New Zealand. © 2009 Blackwell Verlag, GmbH.","Non-target insect species; OranNPV; Painted apple moth; Pathogenicity; Teia anartoides; Virulence",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-74349100094

It has been suggested that indirect effects of crab spiders (Thomisidae) on pollinator behaviour can cascade down the food web and negatively affect plant fitness. However, it is poorly understood how different pollinator groups react to crab spiders and, thus, when a reduction in plant fitness is likely to occur. Using continuous video surveillance, we recorded the behaviour of pollinators on two flower species and the pollinators' responses to three crab spider treatments: inflorescences (1) with a pinned dried spider, (2) with a spider model made of paper, and (3) without spiders (control). We found that pollinators avoided inflorescences with dried spiders only on one plant species (Anthemis tinctoria). Pollinators showed no significant avoidance of paper spiders. Honeybees and bumblebees did not react to dried spiders, but solitary bees and syrphid flies showed a strong avoidance. Finally, we found no evidence that inflorescences with dried spiders suffered from a decrease in fitness in terms of a reduced seed set. We hypothesise that top-down effects of predators on plants via pollinators depend on the degree of specialisation of pollinators and their tendency to avoid spiders. © 2009 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","Indirect effects; Multitrophic interactions; Plant fitness; Predation; Xysticus",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75749107039

A dominant family in Southern Brazil, Asteraceae, was visited most often (50% of the taxa). Nearly 20% of the plants were visited by only one bee species. Meliponina, Ceratinina and Halictinae were prevalent. The diversity of the apifauna composition (Apinae followed by Halictinae) is typical for southern environments, with few abundant species and many singletons. The variation found for the equitability indexes revealed low intertaxa dominance, diversity oscillation and interspecies relative equilibrium.

In particular, we conducted 1) four screening bioassays to determine nematode (seven species, 10 total strains tested) and application level effects on A. tumida larvae and pupae, 2) a generational persistence bioassay to determine whether single inoculations with nematodes would control multiple generations of A. tumida larvae in treated soil, and 3) a field bioassay to determine whether the nematodes would remain efficacious in the field. In the screening bioassays, nematode efficacy varied significantly by tested nematode and the infective juvenile (IJ) level at which they were applied. Although nematode virulence was moderate in screening bioassays 1-3 (0-68% A. tumida mortality), A. tumida mortality approached higher levels in screening bioassay 4 (nearly 100% after 39 d) that suggest suitable applicability of some of the test nematodes as field controls for A. tumida. In the generational persistence bioassay, Steinernema riobrave Cabanillas, Poinar & Raulston 712 strain and Heterorhabditis indica Poinar, Karunaka & David provided adequate A. tumida control for 19 wk after a single soil inoculation (76-94% mortality in A. tumida pupae). In the field bioassay, the same two nematode species also showed high virulence toward pupating A. tumida (88-100%) mortality.

The IC50 and the limit of detection (LOD) values were 14.8 ng mL-1 and 0.11 ng mL-1, respectively, similar to those of colorimetric ELISA with a calibration range of 0.1-2600 ng mL-1. Cross reactivity of some related compounds such as three imidacloprid metabolites, 6-chloro nicotinic acid, 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid, and imidacloprid olefin, and one other chloronicotinoid insecticide, acetamiprid, were tested. The assay was then applied to honeybee extracts obtained by using the liquid-liquid extraction. The calibration curves in honeybee extracts from the liquid-liquid procedure gave an IC50 of 23.7 ng mL-1 and a LOD 1.6 ng mL-1. The average recovery value from honeybee extracts spiked with 100 and 1000 ng mL-1 of imidacloprid were 73% and 76%, respectively.

It is also known that BV possesses anti-inflammatory and anticancer effect and that it can inhibit proliferation and induces apoptosis in cancer cells, but there is no evidence of information regarding anti-apoptosis of BV on hepatocytes. In the present study, we investigated the anti-apoptotic effect of BV on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α with actinomycin (Act) D induces apoptosis in hepatocytes. TNF-α/Act D-treated hepatocytes were exposed to different low concentration (1, 10 and 100 ng/mL) of BV. Our results showed statistically significant inhibition in DNA damage caused by BV treatment compared to corresponding TNF-α/Act D-treated hepatocytes. BV suppressed TNF-α/Act Dtreated activation of bcl-2 family and caspase family, which resulted in inhibition of cytochrome c release and PARP cleavage. These results demonstrate that low concentration BV possess a potent suppressive effect on anti-apoptotic responses of TNF-α/Act D-treated hepatocytes and suggest that these compounds may contribute substantial therapeutic potential for the treatment of liver diseases. © 2010 The Pharmaceutical Society of Korea and Springer Netherlands.","Bcl-2; Bee venom; Caspase; Hepatocyte; Liver; TNF-α",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949890358

Here we study the mechanisms of social thermoregulation of honeybee colonies under changing environmental temperatures concerning the contribution of individuals to colony temperature homeostasis. Beside migration activity within the nest, the main active process is ''endothermy on demand'' of adults. An increase of cold stress (cooling of the colony) increases the intensity of heat production with thoracic flight muscles and the number of endothermic individuals, especially in the brood nest. As endothermy means hard work for bees, this eases much burden of nestmates which can stay ectothermic. Concerning the active reaction to cold stress by endothermy, age polyethism is reduced to only two physiologically predetermined task divisions, 0 to ,2 days and older. Endothermic heat production is the job of bees older than about two days. They are all similarly engaged in active heat production both in intensity and frequency. Their active heat production has an important reinforcement effect on passive heat production of the many ectothermic bees and of the brood. Ectothermy is most frequent in young bees (,,2 days) both outside and inside of brood nest cells. We suggest young bees visit warm brood nest cells not only to clean them but also to speed up flight muscle development for proper endothermy and foraging later in their life. Young bees inside brood nest cells mostly receive heat from the surrounding cell wall during cold stress, whereas older bees predominantly transfer heat from the thorax to the cell wall. Endothermic bees regulate brood comb temperature more accurately than local air temperature. They apply the heat as close to the brood as possible: workers heating cells from within have a higher probability of endothermy than those on the comb surface. The findings show that thermal homeostasis of honeybee colonies is achieved by a combination of active and passive processes. The differential individual endothermic and behavioral reactions sum up to an integrated action of the honeybee colony as a superorganism. © 2010 Stabentheiner et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952527836

To clarify the neural basis underlying the highly sophisticated visual ability of foragers, we investigated the neural activity pattern of the optic lobes (OLs) in pollen-foragers and re-orienting bees, using the immediate early gene kakusei as a neural activity marker. Methodology/Principal Findings: We performed double-in situ hybridization of kakusei and Amgad, the honeybee homolog of the GABA synthesizing enzyme GAD, to assess inhibitory neural activity. kakusei-related activity in GABAergic and non-GABAergic neurons was strongly upregulated in the OLs of the foragers and re-orienting bees, suggesting that both types of neurons are involved in visual information processing. GABAergic neuron activity was significantly higher than non-GABAergic neuron activity in a part of the OLs of only the forager, suggesting that unique information processing occurs in the OLs of foragers. In contrast, GABAergic neuron activity in the antennal lobe was significantly lower than that of GABAergic neurons in the OLs in the forager and re-orienting bees, suggesting that kakusei-related visual activity is dominant in the brains of these bees. Conclusions/Significance:The present study provides the first evidence that GABAergic neurons are highly active in the OL neurons of free-moving honeybees and essential clue to reveal neural basis of the sophisticated visual ability that is equipped in the small and simple brain. © 2010 Kiya, Kubo.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952502726

We compared olfactory lateralization in two species of Hymenoptera Apoidea, the honeybee (Apis mellifera), a social species, and the mason bee (Osmia cornuta), a solitary species. Recall of the olfactory memory 1 h after training to associate an odour with a sugar reward, as revealed by the bee extending its proboscis when presented with the trained odour, was better in honeybees trained with their right than with their left antenna. No such asymmetry was observed in mason bees. Similarly, electroantennographic responses to a floral volatile compound and to an alarm pheromone component were higher in the right than in the left antenna in honeybees but not in mason bees.

Previous research explored recombination in the honeybee, a eusocial hymenopteran with an exceptionally high genome-wide recombination rate. A comparable study in a non-social member of the Hymenoptera that would disentangle the impact of sociality from Hymenoptera-specific features such as haplodiploidy on the evolution of the high genome-wide recombination rate in social Hymenoptera is missing. Utilizing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between two Nasonia parasitoid wasp genomes, we developed a SNP genotyping microarray to infer a high-density linkage map for Nasonia. The map comprises 1,255 markers with an average distance of 0.3 cM. The mapped markers enabled us to arrange 265 scaffolds of the Nasonia genome assembly 1.0 on the linkage map, representing 63.6% of the assembled N. vitripennis genome. We estimated a genome-wide recombination rate of 1.4-1.5 cM/Mb for Nasonia, which is less than one tenth of the rate reported for the honeybee. The local recombination rate in Nasonia is positively correlated with the distance to the center of the linkage groups, GC content, and the proportion of simple repeats. In contrast to the honeybee genome, gene density in the parasitoid wasp genome is positively associated with the recombination rate; regions of low recombination are characterized by fewer genes with larger introns and by a greater distance between genes. Finally, we found that genes in regions of the genome with a low recombination frequency tend to have a higher ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, likely due to the accumulation of slightly deleterious non-synonymous substitutions. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that recombination reduces interference between linked sites and thereby facilitates adaptive evolution and the purging of deleterious mutations. Our results imply that the genomes of haplodiploid and of diploid higher eukaryotes do not differ systematically in their recombination rates and associated parameters. © 2010 Niehuis et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77649312033

Here, we investigate, for the first time, the final moments of a honeybee's (Apis mellifera) landing manoeuvre. Using high-speed video recordings, we analyse the behaviour of bees as they approach and land on surfaces of various orientations. The bees enter a stable hover phase, immediately prior to touchdown. We have quantified behaviour during this hover phase and examined whether it changes as the tilt of the landing surface is varied from horizontal (floor), through sloped (uphill) and vertical (wall), to inverted (ceiling). The bees hover at a remarkably constant distance from the surface, irrespective of its tilt. Body inclination increases progressively as the tilt of the surface is increased, and is accompanied by an elevation of the antennae. The tight correlation between the tilt of the surface, and the orientation of the body and the antennae, indicates that the bee's visual system is capable of inferring the tilt of the surface, and pointing the antennae toward it. Touchdown is initiated by extending the appendage closest to the surface, namely, the hind legs when landing on horizontal or sloping surfaces, and the front legs or antennae when landing on vertical surfaces. Touchdown on inverted surfaces is most likely triggered by a mechanosensory signal from the antennae. Evidently, bees use a landing strategy that is flexibly tailored to the varying topography of the terrain.","Antennae; Apis mellifera; Flight; Honeybee; Hover; Landing; Mechanoreception; Vision",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75249104917

In A. cerana queen-led mixed colonies, almost equal numbers of A. cerana workers (53.4±7.4) and A. mellifera workers (51.2±8.1) attended the A. cerana queen; while in A. mellifera queen-led mixed colonies, the A. mellifera queen attracted significantly fewer (47.8±5.9) A. cerana workers than A. mellifera workers (51.9±4.6). Thus about 100 workers in total were attracted to each queen. In pure A. cerana and A. mellifera colonies, the queen attracted 105.8±9.1 and 107.8±11.2 workers, respectively, there being no significant difference between them. Only the pheromones 9-ODA, 9-HDA and 10-HDA of the queens were significantly different and the workers did not show avoidance behavior to either hetero-specific queen. Both species of workers were attracted by the queens and engaged in retinue behavior, suggesting that the retinue response was not related to a specific queen pheromone or colony environment. This non-specific queen retinue behavior in the mixed colonies indicates that the queen pheromones can be transmitted among the workers from the two species without any obstacles. We conclude that retinue behavior itself as well as the pheromones of the queens that induce this behavior are both primitive, conserved traits that preceded speciation in apine bees. © INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences, 2009.","Apis cerana; Apis mellifera; Queen pheromones; Retinue behavior",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73449095774

The study aimed to produce Apis mellifera (Africanized honeybee) and Crotalus durissus terrificus (C.d.t.) antivenoms using nanostructured silica (SBA-15) as adjuvant and cobalt-60 ( 60Co)-detoxified venoms utilizing young sheep. Natural and 60Co-irradiated venoms were employed in four different hyperimmunization protocols. Thus, 8 groups of 60- to 90-d-old sheep were hyperimmunized, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) serum titers collected every 14 d were assessed clinically daily, and individual weight were measured, until d 84. Incomplete Freund's (IFA) and nanostructured silica (SBA15) adjuvants were compared. The lethal dose (LD 50) for both venoms was determined following intraperitoneal (ip) administration to mice. High-performance liquid chromatography on reversed phase (HPLC-RP) was used also to measure the 60Co irradiation effects on Apis venom. At the end of the study, sheep were killed in a slaughterhouse. Kidneys were histologically analyzed. LD 50 was 5.97 mg/kg Apis and 0.07 mg/kg C.d.t. for native compared to 13.44 mg/kg Apis and 0.35 mg/kg C.d.t. for irradiated venoms. HPLC revealed significant differences in chromatographic profiles between native and irradiated Apis venoms. Native venom plus IFA compared with SBA-15 showed significantly higher antibody titers for both venoms. Apisirradiated venom plus IFA or SBA-15 displayed similar antibody titers but were significantly lower when compared with native venom plus IFA. Weight gain did not differ significantly among all groups. 60Co irradiation decreased toxicity and maintained venom immunogenic capacity, while IFA produced higher antibody titers. SBA-15 was able to act as an adjuvant without producing adverse effects. Hyperimmunization did not affect sheep weight gain, which would considerably reduce the cost of antiserum production, as these sheep were still approved for human consumption even after being subjected to hyperimmunization. © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955294327

The honeybee, Apis mellifera ligustica, is widely recognized as a beneficial insect of agronomic, ecological, and scientific importance. It is important to understand what effects these chemicals have on bees. Effects of two pesticides at sublethal concentrations on fecundity, growth, and development of honeybees were examined with the feeding method for a three-year period (2006-2008). It was shown that both bifenthrin and deltamethrin significantly reduced bee fecundity, decreased the rate at which bees develop to adulthood, and increased their immature periods. The toxicity of bifenthrin and deltamethrin on workers of Apis mellifera ligustica was also assessed, and the results from the present study showed that the median lethal effects of bifenthrin and deltamethrin were 16.7 and 62.8 mg/L, respectively. © 2009 SETAC.","Apis mellifera ligustica; Bifenthrin; Deltamethrin; Sublethal concentration; Toxicity test",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951102187

The aim of this study was to reveal whether grooming behaviour is a useful criterion in breeding of Varroa-tolerant bees. To obtain a reliable evaluation the environmental influences were excluded. The degree of grooming potential was estimated by the percentage of damaged mites in the total number of fallen mites. The heritability of grooming behaviour throughout the three consecutive generations of queens was assessed by mother-daughter regression method. Among unselected queens, expressed grooming behaviour was recorded only in colonies with F1 queens (36.27%), but not in colonies with P queens and F2 queens (33.69%, 31.66%, respectively). Significant differences in grooming behaviour were found between colonies of P and F1 queens (p&lt;0.001), and between colonies of P and F2 queens (p&lt;0.05). However, all of the three generations of selected queens showed expressed grooming behaviour (37.99%, 39.42% and 38.58% in Ps, F1s and F2s, respectively) without significant (p&gt;0.05) difference among them. Nevertheless, the relatively low heritability of grooming behaviour in the three generations of queens examined (h 2yx=0.49±0.02; h2zx=0.18±0.01; h 2zy=0.16±0.01) indicate that breeding colonies for grooming behaviour only cannot be advised to beekeepers whose aim is to breed bees highly tolerant to Varroa mites.","Apis mellifera carnica; Grooming behaviour; Heritability; Varroa",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954472318

N. ceranae appears to be replacing Nosema apis, at least in some populations of European honey bees. This replacement is an enigma because the spores of the new parasite are less durable than those of N. apis. Virulence data at both the individual bee and at the colony level are conflicting possibly because the impact of this parasite differs in different environments. The recent advancements in N. ceranae genetics, with a draft assembly of the N. ceranae genome available, are discussed and the need for increased research on the impacts of this parasite on European honey bees is emphasized. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

When a colony has a queen (i. e., it is queenright) almost all worker-laid eggs are eaten, but when hopelessly queenless, the workers become more tolerant of worker-laid eggs and rear some of them to adult drones. This increased tolerance renders a queenless colony vulnerable to worker reproductive parasitism, wherein unrelated workers enter the colony and lay eggs. Here, we show that the proportion of unrelated (non-natal) workers significantly decreases after an Apis mellifera colony becomes queenless. The remaining non-natal workers are as likely to have activated ovaries as natal workers, yet they produce more eggs than natal workers, resulting in significantly higher reproductive success for non-natal workers. In a second experiment, we provided queenless and queenright workers with a choice to remain in their own colony or to join a queenless or queenright colony nearby. The experiment was set up such that worker movement was unlikely to be due to simple orientation errors. Very few workers joined another colony, and there was no preference for workers to drift into or out of queenless or queenright colonies, in accordance with the proportion of non-natal workers declining significantly after becoming queenless in the first experiment. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Apis mellifera; Conspecific parasitism; Egg dumping; Intraspecific parasitism; Worker drift; Worker laying; Worker reproductive parasitism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75549083995

A Pearson correlation test and a Tukey test were used to determine whether mite reproduction rate varied with brood cell width. Generalized additive model analysis showed that infestation rate increased positively and linearly with the width of worker and drone cells. The reproduction rate for viable mother mites was 0.96 viable female descendants per original invading female.

Box 577 18610-307, Botucatu, SP, Brazil","Apis mellifera, the European honey bee, is perhaps the most studied insect in the Apidae family. Its venom is comprised basically of melittin, phospholipase A2, histamine, hyaluronidase, cathecolamines and serotonin. Some of these components have been associated to allergic reactions, among several other symptoms. On the other hand, bee mass-stinging is increasingly becoming a serious public health issue; therefore, the development of efficient serum-therapies has become necessary, with a consequent better characterization of the venom. In this work, we report the isolation and biochemical characterization of melittin-S, an isoform of melittin comprising a Ser residue at the 10th position, from the venom of Africanized A. mellifera. This peptide demonstrated to be less hemolytic than melittin and to adopt a less organized secondary structure, as assessed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Melittin-S venom contents varied seasonally, and the maximum secretion occurred during the (southern) winter months. Data on the variation of the honey bee venom composition are necessary to guide future immunological studies, aiming for the development of an efficient anti-serum against Africanized A. mellifera venom and, consequently, an effective treatment for the victims of mass-stinging. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We found that worker-laid eggs were more sensitive to desiccation. Secondly, we measured the weight and quantities of vitellin, total protein, lipid, glycogen, and free carbohydrate in queen- and worker-laid eggs. Although worker-laid eggs were found to be heavier than queen-laid eggs in two of the four replicates, no systematic differences were found regarding nutrient content. Finally, we compared the duration of embryo development in the two egg types.

Wide application of fipronil also causes poisoning of some nontarget insects, such as honeybees. In the present study, toxicities of fipronil enantiomers and racemate to the honeybee Apis mellifera L. were determined to examine whether using formulations of single or enriched fipronil enantiomer is a possible option to reduce risks to bees. Contact toxicity tests yielded median lethal doses (LD50) of 3.45, 3.38, and 3.86 ng/bee for the R(-)-enantiomer, S(+)-enantiomer, and racemate, respectively. Analysis of variance indicates that the LD50 values are not statistically different (p = 0.41). Oral toxicities of the R-enantiomer, S-enantiomer, and racemate (nominal median lethal concentration = 0.037, 0.045, 0.053 μg/L, respectively) were also demonstrated to be not statistically different (p = 0.20). In addition, enantiomeric fractions of fipronil in the flowers of three honey plants (Brassica campestris, Cucumis sativus, and Chrysanthemum indicum L.) were examined after treatment with fipronil. It was found that degradation of fipronil in all three plants is not enantioselective. These results indicate that it is unlikely that use of formulations with single or enriched fipronil enantiomer would reduce the risk that fipronil poses to honeybees. Improved fipronil application practices (based on safest timing and bloom conditions) and reduction of overall fipronil usage seem to be more realistic options. © 2009 SETAC.","Enantiomeric fractions; Fipronil; Honey plant flowers; Honeybees; Toxicity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952251352

The most hygienic Russian colonies and the least hygienic Ontario colonies were selected to perform reciprocal crosses between the strains. Bees from the hybrid colonies as well as from the parental colonies were tagged and introduced into observation hives, where hygienic behavior was directly observed on a piece of frozen brood comb. Russian and hybrid bees of Russian mother had the highest percentages of workers uncapping cells and removing brood. Conversely, Ontario and hybrid bees of Ontario mother had the lowest percentages of individuals for these variables. Differences were also observed among the 4 genotypes for their degree of specialization on hygienic tasks.

The upper limit is the maximum pest density that one can expect to reduce to a level below the lower limit given the temperatures expected during the treatment period.

Usually hive tasks require little or no flying, whereas foraging involves flying for several hours a day and carrying heavy loads of nectar and pollen. Flight muscles are particularly plastic organs that can respond to use and disuse, and accordingly it would be expected that adjustments in flight muscle metabolism occur throughout a bee's life. We thus investigated changes in lifetime flight metabolic rate and flight muscle biochemistry of differently aged hive bees and of foragers with varying foraging experience. Rapid increases in flight metabolic rates early in life coincided with a switch in troponin T isoforms and increases in flight muscle maximal activities (Vmax) of the enzymes citrate synthase, cytochrome c oxidase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase. However, further increases in flight metabolic rate in experienced foragers occurred without additional changes in the in vitro Vmax of these flight muscle metabolic enzymes. Estimates of in vivo flux (v) compared to maximum flux of each enzyme in vitro (fractional velocity, v/Vmax) suggest that most enzymes operate at a higher fraction of Vmax in mature foragers compared to young hive bees. Our results indicate that honeybees develop most of their flight muscle metabolic machinery early in life. Any further increases in flight metabolism with age or foraging experience are most likely achieved by operating metabolic enzymes closer to their maximal flux capacity. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Bee; Flight; Insect; Metabolic enzyme; Metabolic rate; Ontogeny; Troponin T",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73949104190

The general characteristics observed in the honeybee brain, stained by metallic impregnation, revealed its anatomical and morphological constitution in agreement with studies of other insect brains using different techniques. Metallic impregnation evidenced the optic lobe neuropils, the ocelli fiber cells, the neuron extensions of the calyces, and the axon bundles that involve the antennal glomeruli, as well as the neuron extensions in the alpha lobe. We also observed that the antennal glomeruli were mainly formed by fibers. The optical lobes were impregnated distinctly in the monopolar neuron bodies and in the fibers. In the mushroom bodies, we observed the lip, collar and calyx basal areas. Based on our results, the metallic impregnation technique is effective to visualize neuronal bodies and neurofibrils; moreover, is simpler and faster than other techniques, offering new insights for the investigation of the invertebrate nervous system.","Invertebrate; Neurofibril; Neuron; Silver",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650355629

The proportion of bees that did not return was higher in the diseased bees compared to the healthy bees when released 30 m away from the colony. That diseased bees get lost from the colony was also supported by a considerably lower rate of infected bees among the returning foragers compared to departing foragers. In a hive entrance orientation test, diseased bees scored lower than healthy bees, indicating impaired orientation skills. These results are in line with previous results on foragers infested by the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. The similar influence of Nosema sp. and V. destructor on flight behavior, in that foragers might not return to the colony, can be interpreted as a general response of honey bees to diseases to decrease pathogen load within the colonies. © INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences, 2009.","Flight; Foragers; Honey bees; Nosema sp.; Pathogens",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73449093835

Hence, this species was selected for genome sequencing and annotation. An intensive interplay between bioinformatics and mass spectrometry (MS) resulted in the annotation of 36 neuropeptide genes (Hummon et al., 2006). Exactly 100 peptides were demonstrated by a variety of MS techniques. In this follow-up study we dissected and analysed separately all ganglia of the central nervous system (CNS) of adult worker bees in three repeats. The combined MALDI-TOF spectra enabled the accurate mapping of 67 peptides, encoded by 20 precursors. We also demonstrated the expression of an additional but already predicted peptide. In addition to putative bioactive peptides we also list and discuss spacer peptides, propeptides and truncated peptides. The majority of such peptides have a more restricted distribution pattern. Their presence provides some information on the precursor turnover and/or the location of neural cell bodies in which they are produced. Of a given precursor, the (neuro)-peptides with the widest distribution pattern are likely to be the best candidates to interact with receptors. The separate analysis of a neuroendocrine complex and the mushroom body yields suggestions as to which (neuro)-peptides might act as hormones and which neuropeptides might be involved in the complex spectrum of non-hormone driven honeybee behaviour, at these sites. Our data complement immunohistochemical studies of (neuro)-peptides in the honeybee, and form a reference for comparative studies in other insect or arthropod models, in particular in the light of recent or upcoming genome projects. Finally, they also form a firm basis for physiological, functional and/or differential peptidomics studies in the honeybee. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A real-time PCR assay was developed to facilitate detection and quantification of both Nosema apis and N. ceranae in both single bee and pooled samples. The assay is a multiplexed reaction in which both species are detected and quantified in a single reaction. The assay is highly sensitive and can detect single copies of the target sequence. Real-time PCR results were calibrated to spore counts generated by standard microscopy procedures. The assay was used to assess bees from commercial apiaries sampled in November 2008 and March 2009. Bees from each colony were pooled. A large amount of variation among colonies was evident, signifying the need to examine large numbers of colonies. Due to sampling constraints, a subset of colonies (from five apiaries) was sampled in both seasons. In November, N. apis levels were 1212 ± 148 spores/bee and N. ceranae levels were 51,073 ± 31,155 spores/bee. In March, no N. apis was detected, N. ceranae levels were 11,824 ± 6304 spores/bee. Changes in N. ceranae levels were evident among apiaries, some increasing and other decreasing. This demonstrates the need for thorough sampling of apiaries and the need for a rapid test for both detection and quantification of both Nosema spp. This assay provides the opportunity for detailed study of disease resistance, infection kinetics, and improvement of disease management practices for honey bees.","Genetic detection; Nosema apis; Nosema ceranae; Real-time PCR",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-72049130798

After a shift to the new host Apis mellifera during the first half of the last century, the parasite dispersed world wide and is currently considered the major threat for apiculture. The damage caused by Varroosis is thought to be a crucial driver for the periodical colony losses in Europe and the USA and regular Varroa treatments are essential in these countries. Therefore, Varroa research not only deals with a fascinating host-parasite relationship but also has a responsibility to find sustainable solutions for the beekeeping. This review provides a survey of the current knowledge in the main fields of Varroa research including the biology of the mite, damage to the host, host tolerance, tolerance breeding and Varroa treatment. We first present a general view on the functional morphology and on the biology of the Varroa mite with special emphasis on host-parasite interactions during reproduction of the female mite. The pathology section describes host damage at the individual and colony level including the problem of transmission of secondary infections by the mite. Knowledge of both the biology and the pathology of Varroa mites is essential for understanding possible tolerance mechanisms in the honey bee host. We comment on the few examples of natural tolerance in A. mellifera and evaluate recent approaches to the selection of Varroa tolerant honey bees. Finally, an extensive listing and critical evaluation of chemical and biological methods of Varroa treatments is given. This compilation of present-day knowledge on Varroa honey bee interactions emphasizes that we are still far from a solution for Varroa infestation and that, therefore, further research on mite biology, tolerance breeding, and Varroa treatment is urgently needed. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) was introduced primarily for honey production but has become the most important insect pollinator of seed, vegetable, fruit crops and pastures. The remaining species (Bombus terrestris (L.), B. hortorum (L.), B. ruderatus (F.), B. subterraneus (L.), Megachile rotundata (F.), Nomia melanderi (Cockerell), Osmia coerulescens (L.) were introduced to pollinate either red clover (Trifolium pratense) or lucerne (Medicago sativa). The honey bee has almost exclusively been relied upon for crop pollination although species of Bombus and M. rotundata are occasionally used commercially. The spread throughout New Zealand of the varroa mite (Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman), a parasite that exclusively kills honey bees, has increased the cost of managing honey bee hives. The use of alternative bee species for crop pollination may reduce the potential impact of factors infl uencing the availability and cost of honey bee pollination services. However, consideration must be given to the potential impact that expanding populations of introduced bees could have on native and exotic fl ora and fauna.

Nevertheless, the ratio selection calculated by this oil is expected to enable its application under field conditions with a good safety margin. This oil could also be used in combination with other oils in integrated pest management strategies in bee colonies. © 2010, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

In this review we consolidate both historic knowledge and recent scientific findings. We document the worldwide spread of the fungus, which is aided by increased global travel and the migratory nature of many beekeeping operations. We discuss the current taxonomic classification in light of the recent complete reworking of fungal systematics brought on by application of molecular methods. In addition, we discuss epidemiology and pathogenesis of the disease, as well as pathogen biology, morphology and reproduction. New attempts at disease control methods and management tactics are reviewed. We report on research tools developed for identification and monitoring, and also include recent findings on genomic and molecular studies not covered by previous reviews, including sequencing of the A. apis genome and identification of the mating type locus.","Ascosphaera apis; Chalkbrood disease; Honey bee",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73749088263

While workers are traditionally believed to behave altruistically, recent studies have revealed behaviors that are more selfish. One such example is intraspecific social parasitism, where workers invade conspecific colonies and produce male offspring that are reared by unrelated host workers. Such intraspecific parasitism has been reported in honeybees (Apis cerana, and A. florea) and ""semi-wild"" bumblebee colonies of Bombus terrestris. Here we report on intraspecific social parasitism by workers in ""wild"" colonies of the bumblebee B. deuteronymus. Three of the 11 B. deuteronymus colonies studied were invaded by non-natal workers, of which 75% became reproductive and produced 19% of the adult males. The invading non-natal workers produced significantly more males than resident natal workers and the non-natal brood was not discriminated against by the natal workers. © Japan Ethological Society and Springer 2009.","Bombus deuteronymus; Bumblebee; Social Hymenoptera; Social parasitism; Worker reproduction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-72449142262

Unlike Apini, with only 11 species in the single genus Apis, stingless bees are a large and diverse taxon comprising some 60 genera, many of which are poorly known. This is the first attempt to infer a phylogeny of the group that includes the world fauna and extensive molecular data. Understanding the evolutionary relationships of these bees would provide a basis for behavioural studies within an evolutionary framework, illuminating the origins of complex social behaviour, such as the employment of dance and sound to communicate the location of food or shelter. In addition to a global phylogeny, we also provide estimates of divergence times and ancestral biogeograhic distributions of the major groups. Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses strongly support a principal division of Meliponini into Old and New World groups, with the Afrotropical+Indo-Malay/Australian clades comprising the sister group to the large Neotropical clade. The meliponine crown clade is inferred to be of late Gondwanan origin (approximately 80 Mya), undergoing radiations in the Afrotropical and Indo-Malayan/ Australasian regions, approximately 50-60 Mya.

(Hymenoptera: Apidae), which supports resistance to Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman. VSH is the hygienic removal of mite-infested pupa. Bees selectively bred for VSH produce colonies in which the fertility of mites decreases over time. In addition, mite fertility decreases after infested brood is exposed to VSH bees for 1 wk. The purpose of this study was to decide whether the reduction in mite fertility is caused by selective removal of mites that produce offspring. Initially, we monitored changes in a small patch of capped brood during exposure to VSH bees at 2-h intervals through 60 h, which provided a reference for the subsequent experiment. The first test showed that VSH bees uncapped, recapped, and began to remove many pupae in ≈2 h. The approach in the second experiment was to compare the percentage of fertile mites from brood exposed to VSH bees for a 3-h period to the percentage of fertile mites in brood that was protected from hygiene by a screen. There were no significant differences in fertility between mites on pupae that were being removed by the bees and mites on protected pupae. These results suggest that neither egg-laying by foundress mites nor mite offspring are the stimuli that trigger hygienic removal of mite-infested pupae by VSH bees. It may be that hygienic activities such as the uncapping of brood cells inhibits or disrupts reproduction by varroa mites. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.","Honey bees; Hygiene; Varroa; Varroa sensitive hygiene",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77749298190

This framework is applied to the recently sequenced genome of the jewel wasp, Nasonia vitripennis, making use of the existing knowledge of motifs and gene annotations in another insect genome, that of the fruitfly. The framework uses cross-species comparison to improve the specificity of its predictions, and does so without relying upon non-coding sequence alignment. It is therefore well suited for comparative genomics across large evolutionary divergences, where existing alignment-based methods are not applicable.

To assess the effects of bee venom in chronic liver disease, we investigated the potential role of the bee venom in the ethanol-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. Bee venom treatment inhibited the apoptotic cell morphology and increased the cell viability in ethanol-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. With ethanol treatment, bee venom-treated hepatocytes increased activity of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, reduced activity of Bax, Caspase and PARP. In conclusion, bee venom treatment in ethanol-induced hepatocyte apoptosis occurred through the regulation of Bcl family with subsequent inactivation of the Caspase and PARP.

Sixty-five samples were studied, out of which 109 pollen types, belonging to 53 plant families, were identified. The families Asteraceae and Leguminosae provided the greatest diversity of pollen types. Multifloral honeys were predominant (> 70%). Monofloral honeys were from Type Polygonum hydropiperoides (7), Sagittaria montevidensis (5), Eupatorium spp. (3), Pontederiaceae (2) and Salix humboltiana (1). Regional honeys are mistakenly called «Catay honeys» (Polygonum spp.) due to the wide distribution of species of this genus and the intense activity of honey bees observed on them. However, in the samples studied, Type Polygonum hydropiperoides varied from < 1% to 81% showing similar sensorial characteristics, among which the absence of crystals stands out. Pollen spectra of the «Catay honeys» reflect the surrounding freshwater wetland vegetation; when they present a value of > 25% taxa that do not belong to this ecosystem, they differ in their sensorial characteristics, particularly the presence of crystals.

Because trehalose is the main haemolymph sugar in most insects, they might possess Tret1 orthologs involved in maintaining haemolymph trehalose levels. We cloned Tret1 orthologs from four species in three insect orders. The similarities of the amino acid sequence to TRET1 in P. vanderplanki were 58.5-80.4%. Phylogenetic analysis suggested the Tret1 sequences were conserved in insects. The Xenopus oocyte expression system showed apparent differences in the Km and Vmax values for trehalose transport activity among the six proteins encoded by the corresponding orthologs. The TRET1 orthologs of Anopheles gambiae (Km: 45.74 ± 3.58 mM) and Bombyx mori (71.58 ± 6.45 mM) showed low trehalose affinity, whereas those of Apis mellifera (9.42 ± 2.37 mM) and Drosophila melanogaster (10.94 ± 7.70 mM) showed high affinity. This difference in kinetics might be reflected in the haemolymph trehalose:glucose ratio of each species. Tret1 was expressed not only in the fat body but also in muscle and testis. These findings suggest that insect TRET1 is responsible for the release of trehalose from the fat body and the incorporation of trehalose into other tissues that require a carbon source, thereby regulating trehalose levels in the haemolymph. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AFB represents one of the main plagues that affect the colonies of honeybees Apis mellifera L. with high negative impact on beekeepers worldwide. Essential oils tested were niaouli (Melaleuca viridiflora) and tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) from Myrtaceae, and citronella grass (Cymbopogon nardus) and palmarosa (Cymbopogon martinii) from Gramineae. The components of the essential oils were identified by SPME-GC/MS analysis. The antimicrobial activity of the oils against P. larvae was determined by the broth microdilution method. In vitro assays of M. viridiflora and C. nardus oils showed the inhibition of the bacterial strains at the lowest concentrations tested, with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) mean value about 320 mg L-1 for both oils, respectively. This property could be attributed to the kind and percentage of the components of the oils.

The use of these essential oils contributes to the screening of alternative natural compounds to control AFB in the apiaries; toxicological risks and other undesirable effects would be avoided as resistance factors, developed by the indiscriminate use of antibiotics.","Antimicrobial activity; Chemical composition; Cymbopogon martini; Cymbopogon nardus; Honeybees' pathogen; Melaleuca alternifolia; Melaleuca viridiflora",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956571267

(Watermelon) is an important crop plant in Kenya. Being monoecious, watermelon is entirely dependent upon pollination services usually by insects for production. Although the centre of origin for this plant is thought to be tropical Africa, essentially not much has been studied of its pollination requirements in this region. The current study investigated the identity of the wild pollinators of watermelon, their behaviour and relative pollination efficiencies at Yatta, a farm near Thika (Eastern Province). The main pollinator for this crop was found to be the honey bee, Apis mellifera but three wild species of Lasioglossum were found as important pollinators. These wild bees have a significantly higher (P< 0.0001) pollen deposition on stigmas of watermelon than honeybees. One of the Lasioglossum (Ctenonomia) sp. 4 deposited on average three times as much pollen as the honeybee. At about the time of stigmatic receptivity, the number of visits by this species to female flowers increases until it equals visits to male flowers irrespective of number of flowers per plot. This behavioural pattern coupled with the high pollen deposition potential makes Lasioglossum (Ctenonomia) sp. 4 a superior candidate as an alternatively managed pollinator for watermelon. Knowing that visitation occurs mostly in the morning, and that flowers last only for one day, spraying can be done in the later hours of the day when the pollinators have virtually stopped foraging on the flowers. In view of the reported pollinator decline globally, the wild pollinator species reported in this study warrant further investigation on their nesting biology and potential for domestication.","Native pollinators; Pollen deposition; Visitation patterns; Watermelon",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149290279

Considering that insulators play important roles in organizing higher order chromatin structure and modulating gene expression, very little is known about their phylogenetic distribution. To date, six insulators and their associated proteins have been characterized, including Su(Hw), Zw5, CTCF, GAF, Mod(mdg4), and BEAF-32. However, all insulator proteins, with the exception of CTCF, which has also been identified in vertebrates and worms, have been exclusively described in Drosophila melanogaster. In this work, we have performed database searches utilizing each D. melanogaster insulator protein as a query to find orthologs in other organisms, revealing that except for CTCF all known insulator proteins are restricted to insects. In particular, the boundary element-associated factor of 32 kDa (BEAF-32), which binds to thousands of sites throughout the genome, was only found in the Drosophila lineage. Accordingly, we also found a significant bias of BEAF-32 binding sites in relation to transcription start sites (TSSs) in D. melanogaster but not in Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, or Tribolium castaneum. These data suggest that DNA binding proteins such as BEAF-32 may have a dramatic impact in the genome of single evolutionary lineages. A more thorough evaluation of the phylogenetic distribution of insulator proteins will allow for a better understanding of whether the mechanism by which these proteins exert their function is conserved across phyla and their impact in genome evolution. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","BEAF-32; Chromatin insulators; Drosophila; Insulator evolution",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76749120445

The microstructures and mechanical properties of these natural silks are measured by environment scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), scanning probe microscopy (SPM), tensile tests, and nanoindentation. It is found that the honeybee silk appears as a single fiber with a circular cross-section and has a much finer and smoother texture than the silkworm silk. The honeybee silk exhibits a distinct linear and brittle elastic feature with an elastic modulus of 6.5 GPa and a breaking strain of 3.8%, whereas the silkworm silk possesses a nonlinear and hierarchical failure character with an initial elastic modulus of 8.9 GPa and a breaking strain of 15.7%. Moreover, the nanoindentation measurements show that the honeybee silk exhibits much less anisotropy than the silkworm silk. The ratio of the longitudinal modulus to the transverse modulus of the honeybee silk is 2.0, whereas that of the silkworm silk is 18.9. The different structural and mechanical properties of the honeybee and silkworm silks are likely a result of their specific biological functions. © 2010 Acta Materialia Inc.

In the spring and summer, division of labor is used to maximize growth rate and resource accumulation, while during the winter, worker survivorship through the poor season is paramount, and bees become generalists. This work proposes new organismal and proximate level conceptual models for these phenomena. The first half of the paper presents a push-pull model for temporal polyethism. Members of the nursing caste are proposed to be pushed from their caste by the development of workers behind them in the temporal caste sequence, while middle-aged bees are pulled from their caste via interactions with the caste ahead of them. The model is, hence, an amalgamation of previous models, in particular, the social inhibition and foraging for work models. The second half of the paper presents a model for the proximate basis of temporal polyethism. Temporal castes exhibit specialized physiology and switch caste when it is adaptive at the colony level. The model proposes that caste-specific physiology is dependent on mutually reinforcing positive feedback mechanisms that lock a bee into a particular behavioral phase. Releasing mechanisms that relate colony level information are then hypothesized to disrupt particular components of the priming mechanisms to trigger endocrinological cascades that lead to the next temporal caste. Priming and releasing mechanisms for the nursing caste are mapped out that are consistent with current experimental results. Less information-rich, but plausible, mechanisms for the middle-aged and foraging castes are also presented. © The Author(s) 2009.","Apis mellifera; Division of labor; Honeybees; Social insects; Temporal polyethism",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75549083273

However, feral bees and managed honeybees are threatened globally by several anthropogenic factors such as changes in agricultural practices, loss of unimproved grasslands, urbanization, and spread of pathogens. These factors have led to the extinction of many native bees, to a reduction in the number of managed honeybee colonies, and put the nutritional bases for bees at risk. Chronic exposure to insec ticides, even when they are appropriately used, may affect the foraging behavior of honeybees, which in turn weakens a colony and makes it more susceptible for diseases. Honeybees suffer from parasites like the Varroa mite, and from several viral and bacterial pathogens, which need to be controlled with great efforts. Climate changes represent future threats that will probably impact native bee populations as well as apicultural practices. Coordinated actions are needed to prevent the global loss of large pollinator populations. Especially the maintenance of plant and bee diversity is very important - as well as basic research on the causes for honeybee colony losses. Together, policy, science, and economy should have a crucial interest in conserving the global pollination service of bees.","Agriculture; Apiculture; Apis mellifera; Biodiversity; Climate change; Conservation; Ecology; Insecticides",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952962799

About 30-50% of patients with insect venom allergy have IgE antibodies that react with both honeybee and yellow jacket venom. Apart from true double sensitisation, IgE against cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCD) are the most frequent cause of multiple reactivities severely hampering the diagnosis and design of therapeutic strategies by clinically irrelevant test results. In this study we addressed allergenic cross-reactivity using a recombinant approach by employing cell lines with variant capacities of α-1,3-core fucosylation. The venom hyaluronidases, supposed major allergens implicated in cross-reactivity phenomena, from honeybee (Api m 2) and yellow jacket (Ves v 2a and its putative isoform Ves v 2b) as well as the human α-2HS-glycoprotein as control, were produced in different insect cell lines. In stark contrast to production in Trichoplusia ni (HighFive) cells, α-1,3-core fucosylation was absent or immunologically negligible after production in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. Consistently, co-expression of honeybee α-1,3-fucosyltransferase in Sf9 cells resulted in the reconstitution of CCD reactivity. Re-evaluation of differentially fucosylated hyaluronidases by screening of individual venom-sensitised sera emphasised the allergenic relevance of Api m 2 beyond its carbohydrate epitopes. In contrast, the vespid hyaluronidases, for which a predominance of Ves v 2b could be shown, exhibited pronounced and primary carbohydrate reactivity rendering their relevance in the context of allergy questionable. These findings show that the use of recombinant molecules devoid of CCDs represents a novel strategy with major implications for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about how signaling may change during the time a signaler is inside the nest and what triggers signal production. All previous feeder studies have used crowded feeders to stimulate stop-signal production. We focused on individual foragers and found that bees returning from uncrowded feeders also produced stop-signals. The number of signals produced by these foragers was roughly proportional to the duration of their stay in the nest. Foragers significantly decreased the rate of signal production throughout their nest stay, potentially reflecting a decrease in signaling motivation with increased time inside the nest. There is a slight trend for signal pulse duration to increase and fundamental frequency to decrease throughout a signaler's nest stay. We examined the effect of crowded feeder conditions by training 20 foragers to a feeder and following focal forager behavior before and after reducing the number of feeding spots. This manipulation increased feeding wait time from 0 s to 409.4±264.3 s without significantly increasing colony nectar intake. Our treatment did not change signal production by focal foragers but significantly doubled the number of stop-signals that focal foragers received inside the nest. At least 38% of these received signals came from foragers visiting the same feeder. Thus, the colony produces stop-signals at a baseline level that can be elevated in response to crowded foraging conditions. © INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences, 2009.","Brief piping signal; Crowding; Foraging; Negative feedback; Stop-signal",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73449091507

We studied several aspects of its reproductive biology, including potential pollinators, floral biology, and diurnal and seasonal flowering phenology. Flower visitors were observed in G. tomentosum populations on O'ahu, Kaho'olawe, and Maui. Primary visitors were introduced species, honeybees and carpenter bees, both of which were pollinating the flowers. No native bee species were seen visiting flowers. In examining floral biology we found that in some cases 10% of flowers had styles that were as short as the anthers or were recurved toward the anthers. In the greenhouse, in the absence of pollinators, these flowers were the only ones that set fruit. Flowering of G. tomentosum commences in January and February, following the rainy season, peaks in May, and may continue into August and September. In one year, after higher than average precipitation during the rainy season, there was a greater abundance of flowering, and flowering persisted later into the year. Transgenic varieties of commercial cotton, G. hirsutum, are grown in Hawai'i and are interfertile with G. tomentosum. Honeybees and carpenter bees are also known pollinators of commercial cotton. Because these pollinators are long-distance foragers, we estimate that transgenic cotton fields would have to be greater than 10 km from a G. tomentosum population to prevent gene flow. © 2010 by University of Hawai'i Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952589047

In social insects, the proboscis extension response conditioning of honey bees has been widely used for several decades. However, a similar paradigm has not been developed for ants, which are advanced social insects showing different morphological castes and a plethora of life histories. Here we present a novel conditioning protocol using Camponotus aethiops. When the antennae of a harnessed ant are stimulated with sucrose solution, the ant extends its maxilla-labium to absorb the sucrose. We term this the ""maxilla-labium extension response"" (MaLER). MaLER could be conditioned by forward pairing an odour (conditioned stimulus) with sucrose (unconditioned stimulus) in the course of six conditioning trials (absolute conditioning). In non-rewarded tests following conditioning, ants gave significantly higher specific responses to the conditioned stimulus than to a novel odour. When trained for differential conditioning, ants discriminated between the odour forward-paired with sucrose and an odour forward-paired with quinine (a putative aversive stimulus). In both absolute and differential conditioning, memory lasted for at least 1 h. MaLER conditioning allows full control of the stimulation sequence, inter-stimulus and inter-trial intervals and satiety, which is crucial for any further study on associative learning in ants. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It shows 50% homology with the hyaluronidase from honeybee venom, Api m 2. Recently, IgE binding to YJ-HYA and cross-reactivity with Api m 2 has been shown to be due to cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCDs). Objective: We sought to quantify the importance of YJ-HYA in yellow jacket allergy and the cross-reactivity with Api m 2 by discriminating between carbohydrate and peptide epitopes. Methods: IgE binding to Vespula species venom was studied by means of Western blotting in 136 patients with yellow jacket allergy (31 in vitro single positive to yellow jacket venom and 105 in vitro double-positive to yellow jacket-honeybee). Inhibition studies were carried out with MUXF-BSA (isolated bromelain glycopeptides linked to bovine serum albumin) and purified Api m 2. Results: Among yellow jacket single-positive sera, only 1 of 31 bound with YJ-HYA, whereas this was the case in 87% of 105 double-positive sera. Of 83 patients in whom inhibitions were performed, 65% reacted with hyaluronidase through CCDs alone, 27% reacted with both CCDs and peptide epitopes, and 8% reacted only with the hyaluronidase peptide. The protein-specific reactivity with YJ-HYA was cross-inhibited by Api m 2 in 48% (14/29). Antigen 5 and phospholipase A1 were each recognized by around 90% of sera from both groups, together identifying 97% of patients. Conclusion: Hyaluronidase is a minor yellow jacket venom allergen, and only 10% to 15% of patients with yellow jacket allergy are estimated to have IgE against the hyaluronidase protein. Peptide-specific cross-reactivity with Api m 2 occurs in half of these sera. Component-resolved diagnosis with antigen 5 and phospholipase would detect virtually all patients with yellow jacket venom allergy. © 2010 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology.","α1,3-Fucose; cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants; honeybee; hyaluronidase; Hymenoptera; N-linked glycans; venom allergy; Vespula species; yellow jacket",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73149092748

We have identified a highly conserved Arg in the P loop of the channel near the selectivity filter that controls Rb/K selectivity. Mutation of this Arg to a Tyr (R128Y-Kir1.1b, R147Y-Kir1.1a) increased the macroscopic conductance ratio, GRb/GK by 17 ± 3 fold and altered the selectivity sequence from Nh4 &gt; K &gt; Tl &gt; Rb ≫ Cs in wt-Kir1.1 to: Rb &gt; Cs &gt; Tl &gt; Nh4 ≫ K in R128Y, without significant change in the high K/Na permeability ratio of Kir1.1. R128M produced similar, but smaller, increases in Rb, Tl, NH4 and Cs conductance relative to K. R128Y remained susceptible to block by both external Ba and the honeybee toxin, TPNQ, although R128Y had a reduced affinity for TPNQ, relative to wild-type. The effect of R128Y-Kir1.1b on the GRb/GK ratio can be partly explained by a larger single-channel Rb conductance (12.4 ± 0.5 pS) than K conductance (&lt;1.5 pS) in this mutant. The kinetics of R128Y gating at -120 mV with Rb as the permeant ion were similar to those of wt-Kir1.1 conducting Rb, but with a longer open time (129 ms vs. 6 ms for wt) and two closed states (13 ms, 905 ms), resulting in an open probability (Po) of 0.5, compared to a Po of 0.9 for wt-Kir1.1, which had a single closed state of 1 ms at -120 mV. Single-channel R128Y rectification was eliminated in excised, inside-out patches with symmetrical Rb solutions. The large increase in the Rb/K conductance ratio, with no change in K/Na permeability or rectification, is consistent with R128Y-Kir1.1b causing a subtle change in the selectivity filter, perhaps by disruption of an intra-subunit salt bridge (R128-E118) near the filter. © 2010 Landes Bioscience.","C-type; Channel; Inactivation; K; ROMK; Rubidium",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953909171

In holometabolous insects, maternal coordinate genes are fast-evolving, the domains that gap genes specify often differ from their orthologues in Drosophila while the expression of pair-rule genes is more conserved. This implies that gap genes may buffer the fast-evolving maternal coordinate genes to give a more conserved pair-rule output. To test this idea, we have examined the function and expression of three honeybee orthologues of gap genes, Krüppel, caudal, and giant. In honeybees, where many Drosophila maternal coordinate genes are missing, these three gap genes have more extensive domains of expression and activity than in other insects. Unusually, honeybee caudal mRNA is initially localized to the anterior of the oocyte and embryo, yet it has no discernible function in that domain. We have also examined the influence of these three genes on the expression of honeybee even-skipped and a honeybee orthologue of engrailed and show that the way that these genes influence segmental patterning differs from Drosophila. We conclude that while the fundamental function of these gap genes is conserved in the honeybee, shifts in their expression and function have occurred, perhaps due to the apparently different maternal patterning systems in this insect. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.","Axis formation; Evolution; Gap genes; Honeybee; Insect; Segmentation",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77649188398

In this paper, this nature inspired algorithm is used in a hybrid scheme with other metaheuristic algorithms for successfully solving the Vehicle Routing Problem. More precisely, the proposed algorithm for the solution of the Vehicle Routing Problem, the Honey Bees Mating Optimization (HBMOVRP), combines a Honey Bees Mating Optimization (HBMO) algorithm with the Multiple Phase Neighborhood Search-Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (MPNS-GRASP) and the Expanding Neighborhood Search (ENS) algorithm. Besides these two procedures, the proposed algorithm has, also, two additional main innovative features compared to other Honey Bees Mating Optimization algorithms concerning the crossover operator and the workers. Two sets of benchmark instances are used in order to test the proposed algorithm. The results obtained for both sets are very satisfactory. More specifically, in the fourteen classic instances proposed by Christofides, the average quality is 0.029% and in the second set with the twenty large scale vehicle routing problems the average quality is 0.40%. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Honey Bees Mating Optimization; Multiple Phase Neighborhood Search-GRASP; Vehicle Routing Problem",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949917583

In this review, we explore current knowledge of the disease and its etiological agent. Paralysis is the only common viral disease of adult bees whose symptoms include both behavioural and physiological modifications: trembling and hair loss. The disease often affects the strong colonies of an apiary and thousands of dead individuals are then observed in front of the hives. Two sets of symptoms have traditionally been described in the existing literature, but nowadays we can define a general syndrome. The morphology of the Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) particles and the multipartite organisation of the RNA genome are exceptional, as most honey bee viruses are picorna-like viruses belonging to the Iflavirus and Cripavirus genera with symmetric particles and monopartite positive, single-strand RNA genomes. CBPV is currently classified as an RNA virus but is not included in any family or genus. Although it shares several characteristics with viruses in the Nodaviridae and Tombusviridae families, it differs from previously known viruses according to the various demarcation criteria defined by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). Thus, it should be considered as the type species of a new group of positive-strand RNA viruses. The recent sequencing of the complete CBPV genome has opened the way for phylogenetic studies and development of new molecular tools able to detect variable isolates and to quantify genomic loads. This article considers the results of such recent detection tests but also previous studies including: (i) the distribution of CBPV infection within the bees and the hive, (ii) the way the virus spreads and its persistence in the colony environment, and (iii) geographical and seasonal distribution and impact of CBPV infections. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Effectively, this approach will make possible to determine the optimal location, biomass supply area and power plant size that offer the best profitability for investor. Moreover, it prevents the accurate method (not feasible from computational viewpoint). In this work, Profitability Index (PI) is set as the fitness function for the BHBF approach. Results are compared with other evolutionary optimization algorithms such as Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO), and Genetic Algorithms (GA).

Its pollen is covered with sticky pollenkitt and not readily released from the anthers. We investigated the role of foraging honeybees in making this pollen airborne. To assess this, six cages were laid over male-fertile (MF) and male-sterile (MS) plants; at flowering, three cages received a honeybee colony while the others served as controls. On average, approximately 25% more pollen grains were deposited on sticky slides (covered with gauze) in cages with honeybees, compared to control cages. The fruit and seed set per not-empty pod of 5 MS plants bagged under gauze to avoid bee visits were 7 times and 3.4 times higher, respectively, in the cages with honeybees than in control cages without honeybees.

In the absence of V. destructor DWV infection does not result in visible symptoms or any apparent negative impact on host fitness. However, for reasons that are still not fully understood, the transmission of DWV by V. destructor to the developing pupae causes clinical symptoms, including pupal death and adult bees emerging with deformed wings, a bloated, shortened abdomen and discolouration. These bees are not viable and die soon after emergence. In this review we will summarize the historical and recent data on DWV and its relatives, covering the genetics, pathobiology, and transmission of this important viral honeybee pathogen, and discuss these within the wider theoretical concepts relating to the genetic variability and population structure of RNA viruses, the evolution of virulence and the development of disease symptoms. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Here we show that larval and adult SHB become contaminated with Paenibacillus larvae spores when exposed to honeybee brood combs with clinical American foulbrood (= AFB) symptoms in the laboratory. This contamination persists in pupae and newly emerged adults. After exposure to contaminated adult SHB, honeybee field colonies showed higher numbers of P. larvae spores in worker and honey samples after five weeks. Despite these results, the rather low number of P. larvae spores on adult SHB suggests that clinical AFB outbreaks are not likely. However, even small spore numbers can be sufficient to spread P. larvae. Therefore, our data clearly show that SHB are vectors of P. larvae. We suggest considering the role of SHB in AFB control in areas where both pests are established. © INRA/DIB-AGIB/ EDP Sciences, 2009.","Aethina tumida; AFB; American foulbrood; Paenibacillus larvae; Small hive beetle; Vector",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73449089777

Local variation in pollination can cause variation in mating patterns, reproductive output, genetic diversity, and selection, which can influence invasion dynamics. We quantified pollinator visitation, pollen deposition, and pollen limitation of reproduction in the invasive shrub Lonicera maackii in adjacent forest edge and forest interior habitats. Flowers in edge habitats received as many or more pollinator visits than those in interior habitats, resulting in twofold greater pollen deposition and nearly twice as many seeds produced per flower. Supplemental pollination increased seed production over open pollination by 37%-145% in both edge and interior habitats. Edge flowers produced more seed than interior flowers. Despite greater pollen deposition in edge habitats, the magnitude of pollen limitation was similar to interior plants. Thus, different mechanisms of pollen limitation characterize these habitats. Pollen receipt and other resources limited reproduction of interior plants, which were located in a shady environment. Pollen quality likely limited reproduction of edge plants, because pollinators visited more flowers per plant and likely delivered more geitonogamous pollen in this habitat than in the interior. Therefore, local variation in abiotic conditions influenced reproduction in this invasive plant, both directly and indirectly via pollinators. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Apis mellifera; Local environmental variation; Nonnative plant; Pollen deposition; Pollinator visitation; Resource limitation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-74949099492

The present paper presents a new method for analyzing controversies on causality in a context of social debate and the results of its empirical testing. The case study used is the controversy as regards the role played by the insecticide Gaucho, compared with other supposed causal factors, in the substantial honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) losses reported to have occurred in France between 1994 and 2004. The method makes use of expert elicitation of the perceived strength of evidence regarding each of Bradford Hill's causality criteria, as regards the link between each of eight possible causal factors identified in attempts to explain each of five signs observed in honeybee colonies. These judgments are elicited from stakeholders and experts involved in the debate, i.e., representatives of Bayer Cropscience, of the Ministry of Agriculture, of the French Food Safety Authority, of beekeepers and of public scientists. We show that the intense controversy observed in confused and passionate public discourses is much less salient when the various arguments are structured using causation criteria. The contradictions between the different expert views have a triple origin: (1)the lack of shared definition and quantification of the signs observed in colonies; (2)the lack of specialist knowledge on honeybees; and (3)the strategic discursive practices associated with the lack of trust between experts representing stakeholders having diverging stakes in the case. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Causality; Honeybee; Imidacloprid; Risk; Uncertainty",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950646686

The recently discovered functional methylation system in the honeybee Apis mellifera presents an attractive invertebrate model system to study evolution and function of DNA methylation. In the honeybee, DNA methylation is mostly targeted toward transcription units (gene bodies) of a subset of genes. Here, we report an intriguing covariation of length and epigenetic status of honeybee genes. Hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes in honeybee are dramatically different in their lengths for both exons and introns. By analyzing orthologs in Drosophila melanogaster, Acyrthosiphon pisum, and Ciona intestinalis, we show genes that were short and long in the past are now preferentially situated in hyper- and hypomethylated classes respectively, in the honeybee. Moreover, we demonstrate that a subset of high-CpG genes are conspicuously longer than expected under the evolutionary relationship alone and that they are enriched in specific functional categories. We suggest that gene length evolution in the honeybee is partially driven by evolutionary forces related to regulation of gene expression, which in turn is associated with DNA methylation. However, lineage-specific patterns of gene length evolution suggest that there may exist additional forces underlying the observed interaction between DNA methylation and gene lengths in the honeybee.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952200574

In an effort to understand the nature and properties of the ionotropic receptors involved in these processes in the honeybee Apis mellifera, we performed a pharmacological and molecular characterization of GABA-gated channels in the primary olfactory neuropile of the honeybee brain - the antennal lobe (AL) - using whole cell patch-clamp recordings coupled with single-cell RT-PCR. Application of GABA onto AL cells at -110 mV elicited fast inward currents, demonstrating the existence of ionotropic GABA-gated chloride channels. Molecular analysis of the GABA-responding cells revealed that both subunits RDL and LCCH3 were expressed out of the three orthologs of Drosophila melanogaster GABA-receptor subunits encoded within the honeybee genome (RDL, resistant to dieldrin; GRD, GABA/glycine-like receptor of Drosophila; LCCH3, ligand-gated chloride channel homologue 3), opening the door to possible homo- and/or heteromeric associations. The resulting receptors were activated by insect GABA-receptor agonists muscimol and CACA and blocked by antagonists fipronil, dieldrin, and picrotoxin, but not bicuculline, displaying a typical RDL-like pharmacology. Interestingly, increasing the intracellular calcium concentration potentiated GABA-elicited currents, suggesting a modulating effect of calcium on GABA receptors possibly through phosphorylation processes that remain to be determined. These results indicate that adult honeybee AL cells express typical RDL-like GABA receptors whose properties support a major role in synaptic inhibitory transmission during olfactory information processing.

Today, many researchers have turned to simple organic systems, not to compare them to other species, but rather to take advantage of the relative lack of complexity of their cellular and molecular architecture for the purpose of modeling basic processes that are assumed to be operative in more intricate organisms. This approach has been used with a number of invertebrates, including the fruit fly Drosophila, the sea slug Aplysyia, and the honey bee Apis mellifera (for reviews, see, e.g., Davis, 2005; Kandel, 2001; Menzel &Muller, 1996, respectively). Many of these studies have examined the neural pathways involved in classical conditioning. More recently, however, attention also has been directed to an even simpler behavioral phenomenon, at least operationally, namely latent inhibition (LI). In the classical conditioning paradigm, the subject encounters paired presentations of the CS and US and the experimenter records changes in responsivity to the CS (i.e., CRs). In LI, the subject is first presented with a series of to-be-CSs, each of which is not followed by an event of consequence (CS−0). Typically, responses to the to-be-CS are not documented. The stimulus preexposure stage is followed by one or more CS−US pairings, during which time CRs are recorded (two-stage procedure). Alternatively, the second stage may be followed by an additional stage in which the CSs again are presented without the US, and the CRs are monitored (three-stage procedure). © Cambridge University Press 2010.",,Book Chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920721661
