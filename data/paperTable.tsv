Why do Varroa mites prefer nurse bees?	The Varroa mite, Varroa destructor, is an acarine ecto-parasite on Apis mellifera. It is the worst pest of Apis mellifera, yet its reproductive biology on the host is not well understood. In particular, the significance of the phoretic stage, when mites feed on adult bees for a few days, is not clear. In addition, it is not clear whether the preference of mites for nurses observed in the laboratory also happens inside real colonies. We show that Varroa mites prefer nurses over both newly emerged bees and forgers in a colony setting. We then determined the mechanism behind this preference. We show that this preference maximizes Varroa fitness, although due to the fact that each mite must find a second host (a pupa) to reproduce, the fitness benefit to the mites is not immediate but delayed. Our results suggest that the Varroa mite is a highly adapted parasite for honey bees.		human, human experiment, nurse, parasite, Varroa	2016-06-15
B+WSN: Smart beehive with preliminary decision tree analysis for agriculture and honey bee health monitoring	United Nations reports throughout recent years have stressed the growing constraint of food supply for Earth's growing human population. Honey bees are a vital part of the food chain as the most important pollinator for a wide range of crops. It is clear that protecting the population of honey bees worldwide, as well as enabling them to maximise their productivity, is an important concern. In this paper heterogeneous wireless sensor networks are utilised to collect data on a range of parameters from a beehive with the aim of accurately describing the internal conditions and colony activity. The parameters measured were: CO2, O2, pollutant gases, temperature, relative humidity, and acceleration. Weather data (sunshine, rain, and temperature) were also collected to provide an additional analysis dimension. Using a data set from a deployment at a field-deployed beehive, a biological analysis was undertaken to classify ten important hive states. This classification led to the development of a decision tree based classification algorithm which could describe the beehive using sensor network data with 95.38% accuracy. Finally, a correlation between meteorological conditions and beehive data was observed. This led to the development of an algorithm for predicting short term rain based on the parameters within the hive. Envisioned applications of this algorithm include agricultural and environmental monitoring for short term local forecasts (95.4% accuracy). Experimental results shows the low computational and energy overhead (5.35% increase in energy consumption) of the classification algorithm when deployed on one network node, which allows the node to be a self-sustainable intelligent device for smart bee hives. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..

Sucrose sensitivity of honey bees is differently affected by dietary protein and a neonicotinoid pesticide	Over a decade, declines in honey bee colonies have raised worldwide concerns. Several potentially contributing factors have been investigated, e.g. parasites, diseases, and pesticides. Neonicotinoid pesticides have received much attention due to their intensive use in crop protection, and their adverse effects on many levels of honey bee physiology led the European Union to ban these compounds. Due to their neuronal target, a receptor expressed throughout the insect nervous system, studies have focused mainly on neuroscience and behaviour. Through the Geometric Framework of nutrition, we investigated effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on survival, food consumption and sucrose sensitivity of honey bees (Apis mellifera). Thiamethoxam did not affect protein and carbohydrate intake, but decreased responses to high concentrations of sucrose. Interestingly, when bees ate fixed unbalanced diets, dietary protein facilitated better sucrose detection. Both thiamethoxam and dietary protein influenced survival. These findings suggest that, in the presence of a pesticide and unbalanced food, honey bee health may be severely challenged. Consequences for foraging efficiency and colony activity, cornerstones of honey bee health, are also discussed. ï¿½ 2016 Dï¿½mares et al.

Specific immune stimulation by endogenous bacteria in honey bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae)	Honey bees are highly important pollinators in agroecosystems, but they are currently under growing environmental pressures (e.g., from pesticides, poor nutrition, and parasites). Due to the multiplicity of environmental stress factors, their protection requires diverse and integrative approaches. Among those is the development of immunomodulatory tools, as immunosuppression is often observed in stressed bees. Toward this goal, the use of exogenous bacteria with immunomodulatory potential has recently been investigated, but knowledge about the potential of honey bee endogenous bacteria is limited. We therefore tested the influence of single strains of five species of endogenous lactic acid bacteria strains on the bee immune system during the larval stage. We measured the expression level of seven immune-related genes and the gene encoding the storage protein Hexamerin 70b. Two of the strains induced an immune stimulation, but this was limited to the antimicrobial peptide Apidaecin1. Upregulation of Apidaecin1 was associated to the downregulation of Hexamerin 70b. Those results suggest that the bee response to endogenous bacteria is specific both at the species and immune levels. As immune responses are costly, this specificity may be adaptive for saving energy and avoiding any negative side effects on the host development or survival. Further screening of bacteria immunomodulatory potential is needed, but associated immune cost needs to be taken into account for improving honey bee resilience to environmental stress. © The Authors 2016.

Sperm viability and gene expression in honey bee queens (Apis mellifera) following exposure to the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid and the organophosphate acaricide coumaphos	Honey bee population declines are of global concern. Numerous factors appear to cause these declines including parasites, pathogens, malnutrition and pesticides. Residues of the organophosphate acaricide coumaphos and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, widely used to combat Varroa mites and for crop protection in agriculture, respectively, have been detected in wax, pollen and comb samples. Here, we assess the effects of these compounds at different doses on the viability of sperm stored in the honey bee queens' spermatheca. Our results demonstrate that sub-lethal doses of imidacloprid (0.02 ppm) decreased sperm viability by 50%, 7 days after treatment. Sperm viability was a downward trend (about 33%) in queens treated with high doses of coumaphos (100 ppm), but there was not significant difference. The expression of genes that are involved in development, immune responses and detoxification in honey bee queens and workers exposed to chemicals was measured by qPCR analysis. The data showed that expression levels of specific genes were triggered 1 day after treatment. The expression levels of P450 subfamily genes, CYP306A1, CYP4G11 and CYP6AS14 were decreased in honey bee queens treated with low doses of coumaphos (5 ppm) and imidacloprid (0.02 ppm). Moreover, these two compounds suppressed the expression of genes related to antioxidation, immunity and development in queens at day 1. Up-regulation of antioxidants by these compounds in worker bees was observed at day 1. Coumaphos also caused a repression of CYP306A1 and CYP4G11 in workers. Antioxidants appear to prevent chemical damage to honey bees. We also found that DWV replication increased in workers treated with imidacloprid. This research clearly demonstrates that chemical exposure can affect sperm viability in queen honey bees. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.		acaricide, antioxidant, chemical compound, detoxification, dose-response relationship, gene expression, honeybee, imidacloprid, immune response, malnutrition, pollen, population decline, sperm, sublethal effect, viability, wax, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Deformed wing virus, Varroa, acaricide, coumafos, imidacloprid, imidazole derivative, insecticide, nitro derivative, animal, bee, cell survival, down regulation, female, gene expression regulation, genetics, male, physiology, randomization, spermatozoon, upregulation, Acaricides, Animals, Bees, Cell Survival, Coumaphos, Down-Regulation, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Imidazoles, Insecticides, Male, Nitro Compounds, Random Allocation, Spermatozoa, Up-Regulation	2016-06-01
Selective Behaviour of Honeybees in Acquiring European Propolis Plant Precursors	Honey bees harvest resins from various plant species and use them in the hive as propolis. While there have been a number of studies concerning the chemical composition of this antimicrobial product, little is known about selective behavior and bee preference when different potential plant sources of resin are available. The main objective of this paper was to investigate some aspects of behavioral patterns of honeybees in the context of resin acquisition. Samples of propolis originating from temperate zones of Europe and the supposed botanical precursors of the product were analyzed. Taxonomical markers of bud resins of two white birch species, aspen, black poplar, horse-chestnut, black alder, and Scots pine were determined through GC-MS analysis. All these trees have been reported as sources of propolis, but comparisons of the chemical composition of their bud resins with the compositions of propolis samples from seven European countries have demonstrated the presence of taxonomical markers only from black poplar, aspen, and one species of birch. This suggests selective behavior during the collection of bud resins by honeybees. To examine the causes of such selectivity, the antimicrobial properties of bud resins were determined. Horse-chestnut resins had lower antimicrobial activity than the other resins which did not differ significantly. © 2016, The Author(s).		antimicrobial activity, biochemical composition, bud, coniferous tree, deciduous tree, gas chromatography, genetic marker, honeybee, mass spectrometry, resin, Europe, Aesculus, Aesculus hippocastanum, Alnus glutinosa, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Betula pendula, Betula pubescens, Pinus sylvestris, Populus nigra, Populus tremula, antiinfective agent, propolis, animal, animal behavior, bee, biosynthesis, chemistry, drug effects, metabolism, plant, Animals, Anti-Infective Agents, Bees, Behavior, Animal, Plants, Propolis	2016-06-01
Honeybees produce millimolar concentrations of non-neuronal acetylcholine for breeding: Possible adverse effects of neonicotinoids	The worldwide use of neonicotinoid pesticides has caused concern on account of their involvement in the decline of bee populations, which are key pollinators in most ecosystems. Here we describe a role of non-neuronal acetylcholine (ACh) for breeding of Apis mellifera carnica and a so far unknown effect of neonicotinoids on non-target insects. Royal jelly or larval food are produced by the hypopharyngeal gland of nursing bees and contain unusually high ACh concentrations (4-8 mM). ACh is extremely well conserved in royal jelly or brood food because of the acidic pH of 4.0. This condition protects ACh from degradation thus ensuring delivery of intact ACh to larvae. Raising the pH to 5.5 and applying cholinesterase reduced the content of ACh substantially (by 75-90%) in larval food. When this manipulated brood was tested in artificial larval breeding experiments, the survival rate was higher with food supplemented by 100% with ACh (6 mM) than with food not supplemented with ACh. ACh release from the hypopharyngeal gland and its content in brood food declined by 80%, when honeybee colonies were exposed for 4 weeks to high concentrations of the neonicotinoids clothianidin (100 parts per billion [ppb]) or thiacloprid (8,800 ppb). Under these conditions the secretory cells of the gland were markedly damaged and brood development was severely compromised. Even field-relevant low concentrations of thiacloprid (200 ppb) or clothianidin (1 and 10 ppb) reduced ACh level in the brood food and showed initial adverse effects on brood development. Our findings indicate a hitherto unknown target of neonicotinoids to induce adverse effects on non-neuronal ACh which should be considered when re-assessing the environmental risks of these compounds. To our knowledge this is a new biological mechanism, and we suggest that, in addition to their well documented neurotoxic effects, neonicotinoids may contribute to honeybee colony losses consecutive to a reduction of the ACh content in the brood food. © 2016 Wessler et al.		acetylcholine, neonicotinoid, acetylcholine, anabasine, choline acetyltransferase, insecticide, nitro derivative, acidity, animal experiment, animal tissue, Apis mellifera, Article, breeding, concentration (parameters), controlled study, degradation kinetics, hypopharynx, larval stage, nonhuman, pH measurement, secretory cell, smooth muscle contraction, survival rate, analogs and derivatives, animal, bee, biosynthesis, drug effects, female, guinea pig, larva, male, metabolism, muscle contraction, nerve cell, physiology, pollination, reproduction, smooth muscle, Acetylcholine, Anabasine, Animals, Bees, Choline O-Acetyltransferase, Female, Guinea Pigs, Hypopharynx, Insecticides, Larva, Male, Muscle Contraction, Muscle, Smooth, Neurons, Nitro Compounds, Pollination, Reproduction	2016-06-01
Varroa destructor and viruses association in honey bee colonies under different climatic conditions	Honey bee colonies are threatened by multiple factors including complex interactions between environmental and diseases such as parasitic mites and viruses. We compared the presence of honeybee-pathogenic viruses and Varroa infestation rate in four apiaries: commercial colonies that received treatment against Varroa and non-treated colonies that did not received any treatment for the last 4 years located in temperate and subtropical climate. In addition, we evaluated the effect of climate and Varroa treatment on deformed wing virus (DWV) amounts. In both climates, DWV was the most prevalent virus, being the only present virus in subtropical colonies. Moreover, colonies from subtropical climate also showed reduced DWV amounts and lower Varroa infestation rates than colonies from temperate climate. Nevertheless, non-treated colonies in both climate conditions are able to survive several years. Environment appears as a key factor interacting with local bee populations and influencing colony survival beyond Varroa and virus presence. ï¿½ 2016 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.		animal, bee, classification, climate, growth, development and aging, isolation and purification, parasitology, Varroidae, virology, virus, Animals, Bees, Climate, Varroidae, Viruses	2016-06-01
Isoform-specific modulation of the chemical sensitivity of conserved TRPA1 channel in the major honeybee ectoparasitic mite, Tropilaelaps mercedesae	We identified and characterized the TRPA1 channel of Tropilaelaps mercedesae (TmTRPA1), one of two major species of honeybee ectoparasitic mite. Three TmTRPA1 isoforms with unique N-terminal sequences were activated by heat, and the isoform highly expressed in the mite's front legs, TmTRPA1b, was also activated by 27 plant-derived compounds including electrophiles. This suggests that the heat- and electrophile-dependent gating mechanisms as nocisensitive TRPA1 channel are well conserved between arthropod species. Intriguingly, one TmTRPA1 isoform, TmTRPA1a, was activated by only six compounds compared with two other isoforms, demonstrating that the N-terminal sequences are critical determinants for the chemical sensitivity. This is the first example of isoform-specific modulation of chemical sensitivity of TRPA1 channel in one species. α-terpineol showed repellent activity towards T. mercedesae in a laboratory assay and repressed T. mercedesae entry for reproduction into the brood cells with fifth instar larvae in hives. Thus, α-terpineol could be used as the potential compound to control two major honeybee ectoparasitic mites, T. mercedesae and Varroa destructor, in the apiculture industry. ©2016 The Authors.		alpha-terpineol, arthropod protein, cyclohexene derivative, isoprotein, terpene, transient receptor potential channel A1, alternative RNA splicing, animal, chemistry, drug effects, gene expression regulation, genetics, metabolism, mite, tissue distribution, Alternative Splicing, Animals, Arthropod Proteins, Cyclohexenes, Gene Expression Regulation, Mites, Monoterpenes, Protein Isoforms, Tissue Distribution, TRPA1 Cation Channel	2016-06-01
Rapid and Reliable Method for Analyzing Acaricides in Honey-Based Products	The acaricide use (Amitraz, Bromopropylate, Coumaphos, Tau-fluvalinate, and Fipronil) is a common worldwide practice in honey cultivation for protect the production. Nevertheless, their presence decreases honey safety and quality and affects the human health. Therefore, it is important to set up an easy, reliable, and rapid analytical method for determining such compounds in bee’s products (honey, molasses, and royal jelly). The method, based on solid-phase extraction using Carbograph 1 as sorbent and analysis by gas chromatography coupled with ion trap mass spectrometer detector (GC/IT-MS), allows very efficient recoveries ranging between 99 and 106 % with relative standard deviation (RSD) ≤5 % for the standard solution and between 98 and 102 % with RSD ≤9 % for samples spiked with 40 ng g−1 of each acaricide. The adsorption isotherms and breakthrough curves for Carbograph 1 sugary solution are reported. The instrumental analytical protocol has been found to yield a linear calibration in the range 10–300 ng g−1 with r2 ≥ 0.991. The limits of detection vary between 1.4 and 5.3 ng g−1 (RSD ≤4 %), whereas the limits of quantification range between 4.6 and 9.4 ng g−1 (RSD ≤6 %); the intra-day and inter-day repeatabilities as RSD were below 9 and 15 %, respectively. The analytical method developed has been applied to several commercial and home-made bee products. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Food for pollinators: Quantifying the nectar and pollen resources of urban flower meadows	Planted meadows are increasingly used to improve the biodiversity and aesthetic amenity value of urban areas. Although many 'pollinator-friendly' seed mixes are available, the floral resources these provide to flower-visiting insects, and how these change through time, are largely unknown. Such data are necessary to compare the resources provided by alternative meadow seed mixes to each other and to other flowering habitats. We used quantitative surveys of over 2 million flowers to estimate the nectar and pollen resources offered by two exemplar commercial seed mixes (one annual, one perennial) and associated weeds grown as 300m2 meadows across four UK cities, sampled at six time points between May and September 2013. Nectar sugar and pollen rewards per flower varied widely across 65 species surveyed, with native British weed species (including dandelion, Taraxacum agg.) contributing the top five nectar producers and two of the top ten pollen producers. Seed mix species yielding the highest rewards per flower included Leontodon hispidus, Centaurea cyanus and C. nigra for nectar, and Papaver rhoeas, Eschscholzia californica and Malva moschata for pollen. Perennial meadows produced up to 20x more nectar and up to 6x more pollen than annual meadows, which in turn produced far more than amenity grassland controls. Perennial meadows produced resources earlier in the year than annual meadows, but both seed mixes delivered very low resource levels early in the year and these were provided almost entirely by native weeds. Pollen volume per flower is well predicted statistically by floral morphology, and nectar sugar mass and pollen volume per unit area are correlated with flower counts, raising the possibility that resource levels can be estimated for species or habitats where they cannot be measured directly. Our approach does not incorporate resource quality information (for example, pollen protein or essential amino acid content), but can easily do so when suitable data exist. Our approach should inform the design of new seed mixes to ensure continuity in floral resource availability throughout the year, and to identify suitable species to fill resource gaps in established mixes. © 2016 Hicks et al.

Non-cultivated plants present a season-long route of pesticide exposure for honey bees	Recent efforts to evaluate the contribution of neonicotinoid insecticides to worldwide pollinator declines have focused on honey bees and the chronic levels of exposure experienced when foraging on crops grown from neonicotinoid-treated seeds. However, few studies address non-crop plants as a potential route of pollinator exposure to neonicotinoid and other insecticides. Here we show that pollen collected by honey bee foragers in maize- and soybean-dominated landscapes is contaminated throughout the growing season with multiple agricultural pesticides, including the neonicotinoids used as seed treatments. Notably, however, the highest levels of contamination in pollen are pyrethroid insecticides targeting mosquitoes and other nuisance pests. Furthermore, pollen from crop plants represents only a tiny fraction of the total diversity of pollen resources used by honey bees in these landscapes, with the principle sources of pollen originating from non-cultivated plants. These findings provide fundamental information about the foraging habits of honey bees in these landscapes.		2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, acetamiprid, acetochlor, atrazine, carbamic acid, carbaril, chlorimuron ethyl, clothianidin, coumafos, cyhalothrin, diethyltoluamide, difenoconazole, dimethoate, dimpylate, dinotefuran, fluvalinate, imidacloprid, metalaxyl, methomyl, metolachlor, neonicotinoid, phenothrin, prallethrin, propiconazole, pyrethroid, spinosad, tetramethrin, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, trifloxystrobin, unclassified drug, foraging behavior, honeybee, insecticide, maize, mosquito, neonicotinoid pesticide, pest species, pollen, pollinator, pollution effect, pollution exposure, population decline, pyrethroid pesticide, soybean, alfalfa, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Article, clover, environmental exposure, forager, foraging, growing season, honeybee, landscape, maize, nonhuman, pollinator, soybean, species diversity, summer, Apis mellifera, Glycine max, Zea mays	2016-05-31

The status of honey bee health in Italy: Results from the nationwide bee monitoring network	In Italy a nation-wide monitoring network was established in 2009 in response to significant honey bee colony mortality reported during 2008. The network comprised of approximately100 apiaries located across Italy. Colonies were sampled four times per year, in order to assess the health status and to collect samples for pathogen, chemical and pollen analyses. The prevalence of Nosema ceranae ranged, on average, from 47-69% in 2009 and from 30-60% in 2010, with strong seasonal variation. Virus prevalence was higher in 2010 than in 2009. The most widespread viruses were BQCV, DWV and SBV. The most frequent pesticides in all hive contents were organophosphates and pyrethroids such as coumaphos and tau-fluvalinate. Beeswax was the most frequently contaminated hive product, with 40% of samples positive and 13% having multiple residues, while 27% of bee-bread and 12% of honey bee samples were contaminated. Colony losses in 2009/10 were on average 19%, with no major differences between regions of Italy. In 2009, the presence of DWV in autumn was positively correlated with colony losses. Similarly, hive mortality was higher in BQCV infected colonies in the first and second visits of the year. In 2010, colony losses were significantly related to the presence of pesticides in honey bees during the second sampling period. Honey bee exposure to poisons in spring could have a negative impact at the colony level, contributing to increase colony mortality during the beekeeping season. In both 2009and 2010, colony mortality rates were positively related to the percentage of agricultural land surrounding apiaries, supporting the importance of land use for honey bee health. © 2016 Porrini et al.

Weakness and collapse of bee colonies in Brazil: Are there cases of CCD?	In the last decades, the decline of wild bee populations and the collapse of Apis mellifera colonies have concerned researchers and beekeepers. The objective of this review was to compile some of the most relevant studies related to the possible causes of these problems - such as nutrition, management, pathogens, parasites, and the effects of pesticides -, besides presenting a brief history of the colony collapse disorder syndrome (CCD) in the United States and Europe. The studies developed in Brazil were presented in more detail, mainly those on pesticides used in agriculture and on pathogens and parasites that attack the colonies of Africanized A. mellifera. Cases of weakening, decline, and collapse have been recorded in Brazil, mainly in the states of Sï¿½o Paulo and Santa Catarina, which add up to great losses. Results of the analyzed occurrences indicated that the recorded mass mortalities were not associated with pathogens or parasites. Only two cases with characteristics similar to those described for CCD were recorded, but without defined causes. In order to know the causes of the weakening and collapses of colonies, the implementation of official programs is urgent for the systematic survey of bee health, associated with research focusing on assessments of possible impacts of habitat fragmentation and agricultural practices on bee communities.			2016-05-01
Chronic toxicity and physiological changes induced in the honey bee by the exposure to fipronil and Bacillus thuringiensis spores alone or combined	In the agricultural environment, honey bees may be exposed to combinations of pesticides. Until now, the effects of these combinations on honey bee health have been poorly investigated. In this study, we assessed the impacts of biological and chemical insecticides, combining low dietary concentrations of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) spores (100 and 1000 μg/L) with the chemical insecticide fipronil (1 μg/L). In order to assess the possible effects of Cry toxins, the Bt kurstaki strain (Btk) was compared with a Bt strain devoid of toxin-encoding plasmids (Bt Cry-). The oral exposure to fipronil and Bt spores from both strains for 10 days did not elicit significant effects on the feeding behavior and survival after 25 days. Local and systemic physiological effects were investigated by measuring the activities of enzymes involved in the intermediary and detoxication metabolisms at two sampling dates (day 10 and day 20). Attention was focused on head and midgut glutathione-S-transferase (GST), midgut alkaline phosphatase (ALP), abdomen glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). We found that Bt Cry- and Btk spores induced physiological modifications by differentially modulating enzyme activities. Fipronil influenced the enzyme activities differently at days 10 and 20 and, when combined with Bt spores, elicited modulations of some spore-induced physiological responses. These results show that an apparent absence of toxicity may hide physiological disruptions that could be potentially damaging for the bees, especially in the case of combined exposures to other environmental stressors. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.		alkaline phosphatase, fipronil, glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione transferase, glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase, antiparasitic agent, bacterial toxin, fipronil, glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase, insecticide, pesticide, pyrazole derivative, bacterium, biopesticide, enzyme activity, fipronil, honeybee, physiological response, spore, toxicity, Article, Bacillus thuringiensis, bacterial spore, chronic toxicity, controlled study, enzyme activity, enzyme regulation, feeding behavior, honeybee, nonhuman, physiological process, survival, toxicity testing, adverse effects, agriculture, animal, Bacillus thuringiensis, bacterial spore, bee, biological pest control, environmental exposure, metabolism, microbiology, physiology, procedures, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Bacillus thuringiensis, Agriculture, Animals, Antiparasitic Agents, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacterial Toxins, Bees, Environmental Exposure, Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase, Insecticides, Pest Control, Biological, Pesticides, Pyrazoles, Spores, Bacterial	2016-05-01
Acute exposure to selenium disrupts associative conditioning and long-term memory recall in honey bees (Apis mellifera)	A plethora of toxic compounds - including pesticides, heavy metals, and metalloids - have been detected in honey bees (Apis mellifera) and their colonies. One such compound is selenium, which bees are exposed to by consuming nectar and pollen from flowers grown in contaminated areas. Though selenium is lethal at high concentrations, sublethal exposure may also impair honey bees' ability to function normally. Examining the effect of selenium exposure on learning and memory provides a sensitive assay with which to identify sublethal effects on honey bee health and behavior. To determine whether sublethal selenium exposure causes learning and memory deficits, we used proboscis extension reflex conditioning coupled with recall tests 30 min and 24 h post-conditioning. We exposed forager honey bees to a single sublethal dose of selenium, and 3 h later we used an olfactory conditioning assay to train the bees to discriminate between one odor associated with sucrose-reinforcement and a second unreinforced odor. Following conditioning we tested short- and long-term recall of the task. Acute exposure to as little as 1.8 ng of an inorganic form of selenium (sodium selenate) before conditioning caused a reduction in behavioral performance during conditioning. And, exposure to 18 ng of either an inorganic form (sodium selenate) or an organic form (methylseleno- l-cysteine) of selenium caused a reduction in the bees' performance during the long-term recall test. These concentrations of selenium are lower than those found in the nectar of plants grown in selenium-contaminated soil, indicating that even low-grade selenium toxicity produces significant learning and memory impairments. This may reduce foragers' ability to effectively gather resources for the colony or nurse bees' ability to care for and maintain a healthy colony. © 2016.		cysteine derivative, methylseleno cysteine, selenate, unclassified drug, pollutant, selenium, heavy metal, honeybee, learning, memory, pesticide, selenium, sublethal effect, toxicity, animal behavior, Apis mellifera, Article, associative conditioning, bioassay, concentration (parameters), conditioning, controlled study, forager, learning disorder, lethal dose, long term memory, memory consolidation, memory disorder, nonhuman, olfactory discrimination, toxicity testing, animal, bee, drug effects, learning, pollutant, smelling, statistical model, toxicity, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Animals, Association Learning, Bees, Environmental Pollutants, Logistic Models, Memory, Long-Term, Olfactory Perception, Selenium	2016-05-01
A toolbox for quantitative gene expression in varroa destructor: RNA degradation in field samples and systematic analysis of reference gene stability	Varroa destructor is the major pest of Apis mellifera and contributes to the global honey bee health crisis threatening food security. Developing new control strategies to combat Varroa will require the application of molecular biology, including gene expression studies by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Both high quality RNA samples and suitable stable internal reference genes are required for accurate gene expression studies. In this study, ten candidate genes (succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA), NADH dehydrogenase (NADH), large ribsosmal subunit, TATA-binding protein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 18S rRNA (18S), heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90), cyclophilin, α-tubulin, actin), were evaluated for their suitability as normalization genes using the geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, and comparative ÄCq algorithims. Our study proposes the use of no more than two of the four most stable reference genes (NADH, 18S, SDHA and HSP90) in Varroa gene expression studies. These four genes remain stable in phoretic and reproductive stage Varroa and are unaffected by Deformed wing virus load. When used for determining changes in vitellogenin gene expression, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the relatively unstable genes actin and α-tubulin was much lower than for the stable gene combinations (NADH + HSP90 +18S; NADH + HSP90; or NADH). Using both electropherograms and RT-qPCR for short and long amplicons as quality controls, we demonstrate that high quality RNA can be recovered from Varroa up to 10 days later stored at ambient temperature if collected into RNAlater and provided the body is pierced. This protocol allows the exchange of Varroa samples between international collaborators and field sample collectors without requiring frozen collection or shipping. Our results make important contributions to gene expression studies in Varroa by proposing a validated sampling protocol to obtain high quality Varroa RNA and the validation of suitable reference genes for expression studies in this globally important pest. © 2016 Campbell et al.

Natural Varroa mite-surviving Apis mellifera honeybee populations	The Varroa destructor mite is the largest threat to apiculture worldwide and has been responsible for devastating losses of wild honeybee populations in Europe and North America. However, Varroa mite-resistant populations of A. mellifera honeybees have been reported and documented around the world with a variety of explanations for their long-term survival with uncontrolled mite infestation. This review synthesizes the work on naturally occurring survival to Varroa mites and discusses what these honeybee populations can signify for apiculture. © 2015, The Author(s).		apiculture, honeybee, host-parasite interaction, mite, natural selection, pest resistance, survival, wild population, Europe, North America, Acari, Apis mellifera, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2016-05-01
Disease dynamics of honeybees with Varroa destructor as parasite and virus vector	The worldwide decline in honeybee colonies during the past 50 years has often been linked to the spread of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and its interaction with certain honeybee viruses carried by Varroa mites. In this paper, we propose a honeybee-mite-virus model that incorporates (1) parasitic interactions between honeybees and the Varroa mites; (2) five virus transmission terms between honeybees and mites at different stages of Varroa mites: from honeybees to honeybees, from adult honeybees to the phoretic mites, from brood to the reproductive mites, from the reproductive mites to brood, and from adult honeybees to the phoretic mites; and (3) Allee effects in the honeybee population generated by its internal organization such as division of labor. We provide completed local and global analysis for the full system and its subsystems. Our analytical and numerical results allow us have a better understanding of the synergistic effects of parasitism and virus infections on honeybee population dynamics and its persistence. Interesting findings from our work include: (a) due to Allee effects experienced by the honeybee population, initial conditions are essential for the survival of the colony. (b) Low adult honeybees to brood ratios have destabilizing effects on the system which generate fluctuating dynamics that lead to a catastrophic event where both honeybees and mites suddenly become extinct. This catastrophic event could be potentially linked to Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) of honeybee colonies. (c) Virus infections may have stabilizing effects on the system, and parasitic mites could make disease more persistent. Our model illustrates how the synergy between the parasitic mites and virus infections consequently generates rich dynamics including multiple attractors where all species can coexist or go extinct depending on initial conditions. Our findings may provide important insights on honeybee viruses and parasites and how to best control them. © 2016 Elsevier Inc..

Multiyear survey targeting disease incidence in US honey bees	The US National Honey Bee Disease Survey sampled colony pests and diseases from 2009 to 2014. We verified the absence of Tropilaelaps spp., the Asian honey bee (Apis cerana), and slow bee paralysis virus. Endemic health threats were quantified, including Varroa destructor, Nosema spp., and eight honey bee viruses. Varroa loads varied across years, with annual fall peaks; Nosema peaked January to April. Migratory beekeepers had significantly lower Varroa prevalence (84.9 vs. 97.0 %) and loads (3.65 ± 0.28 vs. 5.99 ± 0.22) than stationary operations, while Nosema was more prevalent (59.9 vs. 46.7 %) in migratory colonies. Since 2010, chronic bee paralysis virus prevalence doubled annually. We detected strong positive relationships between V. destructor and Varroa-transmitted viruses, between Nosema and Lake Sinai virus 2, and a positive relationship across several viral pathogens of bees. The results provide a disease baseline to help identify drivers of poor bee health. © 2016, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		annual review, apiculture, colony, disease incidence, disease prevalence, honeybee, mite, parasite, pest species, spatiotemporal analysis, virus, United States, Apis cerana, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Chronic bee paralysis virus, Nosema, Tropilaelaps, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2016-05-01
Modulation of pesticide response in honeybees	Honeybee exposure to pesticides is widely accepted, but the role they play in impacting bee health remains controversial. The development of risk assessment procedures is notably a difficult task due to the variability of responses observed for a single pesticide at a specific dose. Indeed, honeybees, during most of their lifetime, are exposed to fluctuating environmental conditions (e.g., pathogen pressure, resource availability, climatic conditions) and can go through important physiological changes within a few days (e.g., behavioral maturation) or even a day (e.g., circadian clock), which are all factors that can affect the bee response to pesticides. Integrating the range of variability in conditions experienced by bees is relevant to honeybee toxicology and will contribute to a better assessment of their susceptibility to pesticides. The aim of this review is therefore to provide empirical evidence of how co-exposure to stressors, and environmental and endogenous factors modulate the honeybee response to pesticide. © 2016, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		dose-response relationship, ecotoxicology, environmental factor, health risk, honeybee, pesticide resistance, physiological response, pollution exposure, risk assessment, toxicity test, Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2016-05-01
A 3-year survey of Italian honey bee-collected pollen reveals widespread contamination by agricultural pesticides	Honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) health is compromised by complex interactions between multiple stressors, among which pesticides play a major role. To better understand the extent of honey bee colonies' exposure to pesticides in time and space, we conducted a survey by collecting corbicular pollen from returning honey bee foragers in 53 Italian apiaries during the active beekeeping season of 3 subsequent years (2012–2014). Of 554 pollen samples analysed for pesticide residues, 62% contained at least one pesticide. The overall rate of multiresidual samples (38%) was higher than the rate of single pesticide samples (24%), reaching a maximum of 7 pesticides per sample (1%). Over 3 years, 18 different pesticides were detected (10 fungicides and 8 insecticides) out of 66 analysed. Pesticide concentrations reached the level of concern for bee health (Hazard Quotient (HQ) higher than 1000) at least once in 13% of the apiaries and exceeded the thresholds of safety for human dietary intake (Acute Reference Dose (ARfD), the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), and the Maximum Residue Limit (MRL)) in 39% of the analysis. The pesticide which was most frequently detected was the insecticide chlorpyrifos (30% of the samples overall, exceeding ARfD, ADI, or MRL in 99% of the positive ones), followed by the fungicides mandipropamid (19%), metalaxyl (16%), spiroxamine (15%), and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid (12%). Imidacloprid had also the highest HQ level (5054, with 12% of its positive samples with HQ higher than 1000). This 3 year survey provides further insights on the contamination caused by agricultural pesticide use on honey bee colonies. Bee-collected pollen is shown to be a valuable tool for environmental monitoring, and for the detection of illegal uses of pesticides. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Study of the metatranscriptome of eight social and solitary wild bee species reveals novel viruses and bee parasites	Bees are associated with a remarkable diversity of microorganisms, including unicellular parasites, bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The application of next-generation sequencing approaches enables the identification of this rich species composition as well as the discovery of previously unknown associations. Using high-throughput polyadenylated ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing, we investigated the metatranscriptome of eight wild bee species (Andrena cineraria, Andrena fulva, Andrena haemorrhoa, Bombus terrestris, Bombus cryptarum, Bombus pascuorum, Osmia bicornis, and Osmia cornuta) sampled from four different localities in Belgium. Across the RNA sequencing libraries, 88-99% of the taxonomically informative reads were of the host transcriptome. Four viruses with homology to insect pathogens were found including two RNA viruses (belonging to the families Iflaviridae and Tymoviridae that harbor already viruses of honey bees), a double stranded DNA virus (family Nudiviridae) and a single stranded DNA virus (family Parvoviridae). In addition, we found genomic sequences of 11 unclassified arthropod viruses (related to negeviruses, sobemoviruses, totiviruses, rhabdoviruses, and mononegaviruses), seven plant pathogenic viruses, and one fungal virus. Interestingly, nege-like viruses appear to be widespread, host-specific, and capable of attaining high copy numbers inside bees. Next to viruses, three novel parasite associations were discovered in wild bees, including Crithidia pragensis and a tubulinosematid and a neogregarine parasite. Yeasts of the genus Metschnikowia were identified in solitary bees. This study gives a glimpse of the microorganisms and viruses associated with social and solitary wild bees and demonstrates that their diversity exceeds by far the subset of species first discovered in honey bees. © 2018 Schoonvaere, Smagghe, Francis and de Graaf.		transcriptome, algorithm, Article, Basidiomycetes, bee, bumblebee, DNA library, DNA virus, high throughput sequencing, Metschnikowia, Microsporidia, mycovirus, next generation sequencing, nonhuman, open reading frame, phylogeny, Picornavirales, plant virus, protein expression, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RNA extraction, RNA sequence, RNA virus, Sanger sequencing, sequence alignment, Trypanosoma, virus genome	2018-02-14
Short-Term Exposure to Lambda-Cyhalothrin Negatively Affects the Survival and Memory-Related Characteristics of Worker Bees Apis mellifera	(  Article in press  )			2018-02-08
Effects of neonicotinoid imidacloprid exposure on bumble bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) queen survival and nest initiation	Neonicotinoids are highly toxic to insects and may systemically translocate to nectar and pollen of plants where foraging bees may become exposed. Exposure to neonicotinoids can induce detrimental sublethal effects on individual and colonies of bees and may have long-term impacts, such as impaired foraging, reduced longevity, and reduced brood care or production. Less well-studied are the potential effects on queen bumble bees that may become exposed while foraging in the spring during colony initiation. This study assessed queen survival and nest founding in caged bumble bees [Bombus impatiens (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Apidae)] after chronic (18-d) dietary exposure of imidacloprid in syrup (1, 5, 10, and 25 ppb) and pollen (0.3, 1.7, 3.3, and 8.3 ppb), paired respectively. Here we show some mortality in queens exposed at all doses even as low as 1 ppb, and, compared with untreated queens, significantly reduced survival of treated queens at the two highest doses. Queens that survived initial imidacloprid exposure commenced nest initiation; however, they exhibited dose-dependent delay in egg-laying and emergence of worker brood. Furthermore, imidacloprid treatment affected other parameters such as nest and queen weight. This study is the first to show direct impacts of imidacloprid at field-relevant levels on individual B. impatiens queen survival and nest founding, indicating that bumble bee queens are particularly sensitive to neonicotinoids when directly exposed. This study also helps focus pesticide risk mitigation efforts and highlights the importance of reducing exposure rates in the early spring when bumble bee queens, and other wild bees are foraging and initiating nests. © The Author(s) 2017.

The immunological dependence of plant-feeding animals on their host’s medical properties may explain part of honey bee colony losses	The honey bee (Apis mellifera) is an important pollinator of agricultural and horticultural crops, but also of wild flowers. The species has been facing declines in many areas of the world, the causes being identified as multifactorial. Recently, it has been theorised that some plant-dwelling animals may develop a dependence on the medicinal properties of their hots plant’s secondary metabolites. Here, the question of honey bee self-medication using organic materials, namely propolis, nectar, honey, honeydew, pollen, wood, and algae for self-medication is addressed. Self-medication in honey bees is a largely unexplored area and thus a comprehensive overview of the field is provided. Prior studies suggest that recent honey bee colony declines are driven by decreased forage plant availability. The problem is expanded and it is suggested, that if honey bees developed a dependence on medical properties of some disappearing plants or materials, this could explain a part of the colony losses observed around the world. To date, convincing evidence points towards self-medication with honey and propolis. Bees also contact plant secondary metabolites, fatty acids, essential oils, and microorganisms that are active against the causative agents of American foulbrood, European foulbrood, nosemosis, chalkbrood, stonebrood, and varroasis. In the future, selected taxa of plants with medicinal properties may be planted to boost honey bee health without chemotherapy. Future directions of research are discussed. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.		colony, honeybee, immune response, metabolite, plant-insect interaction, pollinator, population decline, algae, Animalia, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Cucumis melo var. inodorus, Invertebrata	2018-02-01
Nosema ceranae disease of the honey bee (Apis mellifera)	The presence of honey bees in our landscapes has long invoked images of vitality, diligence, and cooperation. Unfortunately, the current state of bee health paints a rather different picture. The survival of honey bees, as well as the livelihoods of those who benefit from their labor, is under threat from several detractors to bee health. Exposure to pesticides, poor forage, mite parasites, and pathogens has resulted in high annual death of colonies in the USA, Europe, and other parts of the world. Among the suspects thought to contribute to bee decline, the fungal pathogen, Nosema ceranae, is found at high prevalence in both healthy and declining colonies. Since N. ceranae is thought to be a recent parasite of Apis mellifera, much remains unknown about its pathology at the individual and colony levels, as well as how infection may interact and synergize with other stressors. A review of research conducted on N. ceranae infection is provided. Attention is given to observations on detection of infection, cytopathology, viability and infectivity of spores, and caste-specific effects to survival, development, physiology, and behavior. Research findings showing effects from interactions with pesticides and viruses are also provided. Comparisons are drawn between N. ceranae and what is known about a similar, long-recognized pathogen of A. mellifera, Nosema apis. When possible, suggestions for future research that could broaden understanding of N. ceranae and ultimately improve honey bee health are offered to link observations on individual bee pathology with pathology observed at the colony level. © 2017, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS.		fungal disease, fungus, honeybee, host-parasite interaction, parasite, pathogen, pesticide, population decline, social behavior, survival, virus, Europe, United States, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Microsporidia, Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae	2018-02-01
Specialty oilseed crops provide an abundant source of pollen for pollinators and beneficial insects	The continuing pollinator crisis is due, in part, to the lack of year-round floral resources. In intensive farming regions, such as the Upper Midwest (UMW) of the USA, natural and pastoral vegetation largely has been replaced by annual crops such as maize (Zea mays L.), soyabean (Glycine max L.) and wheat (Triticum spp.). Neither the energy (nectar) nor protein (pollen) needs of pollinating and other beneficial insects are being met sufficiently by the new, high-intensity, agricultural landscape. Several potentially useful oilseed crops can be grown in the UMW, and many of these oilseeds are highly attractive to beneficial insects. Prior research showed that some of these oilseeds produced abundant nectar, but their corresponding values for pollen production are unknown. Accordingly, the aim of our research was to document pollen (and protein) production per unit area of twelve oilseed crops grown in Minnesota and associate these values with levels of beneficial insect visitation during anthesis. Our results show that oilseed crops such as camelina (Camelina sativa L.), flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) and pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) produce relatively little pollen (≤40 kg/ha); borage (Borago officinalis L.), calendula (Calendula officinalis L.), canola (Brassica napus L.), crambe (Crambe abyssianica Hochst) and cuphea (Cuphea viscosissima Jacq. × Cuphea lanceolata W. T. Aiton) produce bountiful pollen resources (50–150 kg/ha); and oilseed echium (Echium plantagineum L.) generates massive amounts of pollen (>400 kg/ha), about 50% of which is protein. Our study is unique in presenting a season-long perspective of pollen production in alternative oilseed crops, a resource valuable to pollen-feeding insects such as managed and wild bees. Diversification of UMW landscapes that includes alternative oilseed crops such as oilseed echium and cuphea can potentially provide a ready source of pollen and protein to help combat pollinator decline.

Reproduction of parasitic mites Varroa destructor in original and new honeybee hosts	The ectoparasitic mite, Varroa destructor, shifted host from the eastern honeybee, Apis cerana, to the western honeybee, Apis mellifera. Whereas the original host survives infestations by this parasite, they are lethal to colonies of its new host. Here, we investigated a population of A. cerana naturally infested by the V. destructor Korea haplotype that gave rise to the globally invasive mite lineage. Our aim was to better characterize traits that allow for the survival of the original host to infestations by this particular mite haplotype. A known major trait of resistance is the lack of mite reproduction on worker brood in A. cerana. We show that this trait is neither due to a lack of host attractiveness nor of reproduction initiation by the parasite. However, successful mite reproduction was prevented by abnormal host development. Adult A. cerana workers recognized this state and removed hosts and parasites, which greatly affected the fitness of the parasite. These results confirm and complete previous observations of brood susceptibility to infestation in other honeybee host populations, provide new insights into the coevolution between hosts and parasites in this system, and may contribute to mitigating the large-scale colony losses of A. mellifera due to V. destructor. © 2018 The Authors.

Characterization of gut bacterial flora of Apis mellifera from north-west Pakistan	Gut microbiota has been recognized to play a beneficial role in honey bees (Apis mellifera). Present study was designed to characterize the gut bacterial flora of honey bees in north-west Pakistan. Total 150 aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria from guts of 45 worker bees were characterized using biochemical assays and 16S rDNA sequencing followed by bioinformatics analysis. The gut isolates were classified into three bacterial phyla of Firmicutes (60%), Proteobacteria (26%) and Actinobacteria (14%). Most of the isolates belonged to genera and families of Staphylococcus, Bacillus, Enterococcus, Ochrobactrum, Sphingomonas, Ralstonia, Enterobacteriaceae, Corynebacterium and Micrococcineae. Many of these bacteria were tolerant to acidic environments and fermented sugars, hence considered beneficial gut inhabitants and involved the maintenance of a healthy microbiota. However, several opportunistic commensals that proliferate in the hive environment including members Staphylococcus haemolyticus group and Sphingomonas paucimobilis were also identified. This is the first report on bee gut microbiota from north-west Pakistan geographically situated at the crossroads of Indian subcontinent and central Asia. © 2017 The Authors			2018-02-01
Stress decreases pollen foraging performance in honeybees	Foraging in honeybees is energetically demanding. Here, we examined whether stressors, which generally increase metabolic demands, can impair foraging performance. A controlled non-pathogenic stressor (immune challenge) resulted in a change in the foraging preferences of bees. It reduced pollen foraging and increased the duration of trips in pollen foragers. Stress also reduced the amount of octopamine in the brain of pollen foragers (a biogenic amine involved in the regulation of foraging and flight behaviour in insects). According to the literature, flight metabolic rate is higher during pollen foraging than during nectar foraging, and nectar gives a higher energetic return relative to the foraging effort when compared with pollen. We thus propose that stress might be particularly detrimental to the performance of pollen foragers, and stressed bees prefer the energy-rich resource of nectar. In conclusion, stress, even at low levels, could have consequences for bee foraging behaviour and thereby the nutritional balance of the colony. © 2018.

From field to food—will pesticide-contaminated pollen diet lead to a contamination of royal jelly?	The contamination of bee products, e.g., bee bread, by pesticides is an increasing problem of beekeeping in rural areas. Bee bread is used by nurse bees to produce larval food. However, the fate of pesticides originating from the pollen during this process is unknown. Over the entire period of queen rearing, adult honeybees in queenless mini-hives were fed with a pollen-honey diet containing a cocktail of 13 commonly used pesticides in high concentrations (34–920 μg/kg). Royal jelly (RJ) harvested from queen cells was subjected to a multi-residue analysis. Seven substances were rediscovered in traces (76.5% of all detections are below 1 μg/kg) with at most 0.016% of the original pesticide concentrations of the fed diet. Considering this extraordinary low contamination of RJ, it seems unlikely that pesticides, if used according to the approved application instructions, would impair the development and health of honeybee queens. Possible reasons for the low residue levels in RJ are discussed. © 2017, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS.		bee, concentration (composition), diet, food, pesticide, queen, rearing, Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2018-02-01
Genomes of the Hymenoptera	Hymenoptera is the second-most sequenced arthropod order, with 52 publically archived genomes (71 with ants, reviewed elsewhere), however these genomes do not capture the breadth of this very diverse order (Figure 1, Table 1). These sequenced genomes represent only 15 of the 97 extant families. Although at least 55 other genomes are in progress in an additional 11 families (see Table 2), stinging wasps represent 35 (67%) of the available and 42 (76%) of the in progress genomes. A more comprehensive catalog of hymenopteran genomes is needed for research into the evolutionary processes underlying the expansive diversity in terms of ecology, behavior, and physiological traits within this group. Additional sequencing is needed to generate an assembly for even 0.05% of the estimated 1 million hymenopteran species, and we recommend premier level assemblies for at least 0.1% of the >150,000 named species dispersed across the order. Given the haplodiploid sex determination in Hymenoptera, haploid male sequencing will help minimize genome assembly issues to enable higher quality genome assemblies. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.			2018-02-01
Classical and geometric morphometric methods reveal differences between specimens of Varroa destructor (Mesostigmata: Varroidae) from seven provinces of Iran	Varroa destructor Anderson & Truman is the most serious pest of honey bee colonies all over the world. Its specimens were assessed by morphometric and geometric morphometric methods using six morphometric traits including body length and width, length and width of the right metapodal shield, length of epigynal and the anal shield for classical morphometrics and six landmarks in ventral surface of mite's body, in seven provinces including Ardabil, Markazi, Qom, Qazvin, Alborz, North Khorasan, and Semnan. Twenty and ten individuals were used for morphometric and geometric morphometric studies, respectively. The ventral surface of each mite slide was prepared and used Digimizer and Tps package software for morphometric and geometric morphometric measurements, respectively. Data were analyzed with Past software. Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA) was used for both two methods. In addition, Cluster analysis was used to categorize specimens of provinces. The results demonstrated significantly morphometric and geometric morphometric (or shape and size) differences among the specimens of provinces. Qazvin and Ardabil were located in one group with the PCA and Cluster analysis in the classical morphometric method and Alborz mite's dimensions showed a significant difference in morphometric measurements with other provinces. However, in the geometric morphometric method, Ardabil, Markazi, North Khorasan, and Semnan specimens were located in another group. The difference in distribution can be related to geographical factors and methods of measurement.			2018-01-15
Nutritional Physiology and Ecology of Honey Bees	Honey bees feed on floral nectar and pollen that they store in their colonies as honey and bee bread. Social division of labor enables the collection of stores of food that are consumed by within-hive bees that convert stored pollen and honey into royal jelly. Royal jelly and other glandular secretions are the primary food of growing larvae and of the queen but are also fed to other colony members. Research clearly shows that bees regulate their intake, like other animals, around specific proportions of macronutrients. This form of regulation is done as individuals and at the colony level by foragers. © 2018 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.			2018-01-07
Determining the minimum number of pollen grains needed for accurate honey bee (Apis mellifera) colony pollen pellet analysis	Honey bee (Apis mellifera) colony maintenance depends on foraging workers to obtain food resources from flowering plants year round. Because diverse floral diets have a positive impact on honey bee health, identifying the plants preferred by foragers provides valuable information to manage bee-friendly habitats. Recent studies have utilized palynology to better understand honey bee nectar foraging preferences. Futhermore, the International Honey Commission has established standards for analyzing honey samples. However, standards for studying the plant taxonomic composition of honey bee pollen pellets have not been established. The goal of this project was to determine the minimum number of pollen grains that need to be counted to obtain an accurate floral taxonomic representation in a pollen pellet sample. To do this, pollen samples were collected from pollen traps placed outside honey bee hives, and a pollen subsample foraged by each colony was acetolyzed and identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Cohorts of 100 pollen grains obtained from homogenized pollen samples from three different colonies were counted successively 5 times for a total count of 500 pollen grains per colony. This was repeated for each of the replicates from the three separate colonies. We found no statistically significant differences in the number or proportion of floral taxa found between the 200 and 500 pollen grain counts in two out of the three colonies sampled. Species diversity index analysis suggested that the higher number of floral taxa found in some 500-grain counts were attributed to a relatively low presence of minor pollen types. Thus, a 200 pollen grain count seems sufficient to assess the predominant, secondary and important minor plant taxa present in a pollen sample, while a 500-grain count may be needed to elucidate a more specific taxonomic assessment of additional minor taxa floral types to determine a sample's geographic origin. © 2017 AASP–The Palynological Society.		diversity index, floral trait, homogeneity, honey, honeybee, identification method, nectar, palynology, pollination, preference behavior, taxonomy, trap (equipment), worker caste, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Magnoliophyta	2018-01-02
Using colony monitoring devices to evaluate the impacts of land use and nutritional value of forage on honey bee health	Colony monitoring devices used to track and assess the health status of honey bees are becoming more widely available and used by both beekeepers and researchers. These devices monitor parameters relevant to colony health at frequent intervals, often approximating real time. The fine-scale record of hive condition can be further related to static or dynamic features of the landscape, such as weather, climate, colony density, land use, pesticide use, vegetation class, and forage quality. In this study, we fit commercial honey bee colonies in two apiaries with pollen traps and digital scales to monitor floral resource use, pollen quality, and honey production. One apiary was situated in low-intensity agriculture; the other in high-intensity agriculture. Pollen traps were open for 72 h every two weeks while scales recorded weight every 15 min throughout the growing season. From collected pollen, we determined forage quantity per day, species identity using DNA sequencing, pesticide residues, amino acid content, and total protein content. From scales, we determined the accumulated hive weight change over the growing season, relating to honey production and final colony weight going into winter. Hive scales may also be used to identify the occurrence of environmental pollen and nectar dearth, and track phenological changes in plant communities. We provide comparisons of device-derived data between two apiaries over the growing season and discuss the potential for employing apiary monitoring devices to infer colony health in the context of divergent agricultural land use conditions. © 2017 by the authors.

Lactobacillus kunkeei strains decreased the infection by honey bee pathogens Paenibacillus larvae and Nosema ceranae	Due to their social behaviour, honey bees can be infected by a wide range of pathogens including the microsporidia Nosema ceranae and the bacteria Paenibacillus larvae. The use of probiotics as food additives for the control or prevention of infectious diseases is a widely used approach to improve human and animal health. In this work, we generated a mixture of four Lactobacillus kunkeei strains isolated from the gut microbial community of bees, and evaluated its potential beneficial effect on larvae and adult bees. Its administration in controlled laboratory models was safe for larvae and bees; it did not affect the expression of immune-related genes and it was able to decrease the mortality associated to P. larvae infection in larvae and the counts of N. ceranae spores from adult honey bees. These promising results suggest that this beneficial microorganism's mixture may be an attractive strategy to improve bee health. Field studies are being carried out to evaluate its effect in naturally infected colonies. © 2017 Wageningen Academic Publishers.			2018-01-01
Lethal effects of Cr(III) alone and in combination with propiconazole and clothianidin in honey bees	Several anthropogenic contaminants, including pesticides and heavy metals, can affect honey bee health. The effects of mixtures of heavy metals and pesticides are rarely studied in bees, even though bees are likely to be exposed to these contaminants in both agricultural and urban environments. In this study, the lethal toxicity of Cr alone and in combination with the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin and the ergosterol-biosynthesis-inhibiting fungicide propiconazole was assessed in Apis mellifera adults. The LD50 and lowest benchmark dose of Cr as Cr(NO3)3, revealed a low acute oral toxicity on honey bee foragers (2049 and 379 mg L−1, respectively) and the Cr retention (i.e. bee ability to retain the heavy metal in the body) was generally low compared to other metals. A modified method based on the binomial proportion test was developed to analyse synergistic and antagonistic interactions between the three tested contaminants. The combination of an ecologically-relevant field concentration of chromium with clothianidin and propiconazole did not increase bee mortality. On the contrary, the presence of Cr in mixture with propiconazole elicited a slight antagonistic effect. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd		Biochemistry, Chromium compounds, Food products, Heavy metals, Mixtures, Pesticide effects, Pesticides, Pollution, Toxicity, Antagonistic effects, Antagonistic interactions, Anthropogenic contaminants, Apis mellifera, Eco-toxicology, Field concentrations, Neonicotinoid insecticides, Synergism/antagonism, Chromium, agricultural chemical, chromium, clothianidin, propiconazole, chromium, clothianidin, guanidine derivative, insecticide, neonicotinoid, pesticide, propiconazole, thiazole derivative, triazole derivative, antagonism, anthropogenic effect, bee, chemical pollutant, chromium, ecotoxicology, fungicide, heavy metal, mortality, neonicotinoid pesticide, pollution effect, toxicity, urban area, adult, animal experiment, Apis mellifera, Apis mellifera ligustica, Article, bioaccumulation, controlled study, ingestion, LD50, mortality, nonhuman, animal, bee, chemistry, drug interaction, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Animals, Bees, Chromium, Drug Interactions, Guanidines, Insecticides, Neonicotinoids, Pesticides, Thiazoles, Triazoles	2018-01-01
Epormenis cestri secretions in Sebastiania schottiana trees cause mass death of honey bee Apis mellifera larvae in Uruguay	For more than 60 years, sporadic cases of massive summer honey bee larvae mortality in colonies located near freshwater systems with abundant riparian vegetation have been reported in Uruguay. This odd phenomenon, known as “River disease” by beekeepers, can lead to colony death by depopulation. The aim of this study was to detect the causes of larvae death. Different experiments and analyses were performed using affected apiaries located between two important water courses. 1 day old larvae were the most susceptible and substances that killed the larvae were present in the nectar but not in the pollen. A palynological analysis of nectar samples showed that bees collect this resource from commonly pollinated floral species in the country. However, abundant fungi spores and conidia were found, which indicates that the bees also collected honeydews. In the riparian vegetation, bees were observed collecting the secretions of the planthopper Epormenis cestri on Sebastiania schottiana trees. It was found that the mortality period of larvae overlaps with the presence of E. cestri. Larvae maintained in the laboratory were fed (i) nectar from healthy colonies, (ii) nectar from affected colonies, and (iii) secretions of E. cestri. The mortality of the larvae that received nectar from colonies affected with River disease and secretions of E. cestri was higher than the mortality of those receiving nectar from healthy colonies. This represents the first report of planthopper honeydew causing mass larval mortality in honey bees. © 2018 Invernizzi et al.

The impact of selected pesticides on honey bees	The presence of honey bee in the environment has a significant impact on global agricultural production. While searching for pollen and nectar, the bee is often exposed to several contaminants such as plant protection products. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of selected pesticides from various groups (fungicides, herbicides, insecticides) on the way the bees harvested food as well as on their behavior, survival rate and the concentration of certain elements in the organisms of bee. The concentration possibly similar to this applied in agriculture and recommended by the manufacturers, were used. The research material was analyzed in terms of the presence of trace elements (manganese, copper, iron, nickel, zinc, lead, cadmium) of different toxicity. The study clearly indicates that selected pesticides used for the purpose of plant protection and plant cultivation may adversely on bees’ behavior and accumulation of trace elements in their body. Among the tested pesticides particular attention should be paid to fungicides that are not commonly tested for their effects on the honey organ. In own studies showed, their effect significantly changed the content of copper and negatively affected the survival of the bees. © 2018, HARD Publishing Company. All rights reserved.			2018-01-01
Primary data in pollination services mapping: potential service provision by honey bees (Apis mellifera) in Cumberland and Colchester, Nova Scotia	This study utilized the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) pollination model to investigate the impacts of using field data on ecosystem services mapping studies by using potential pollination services in Cumberland and Colchester counties in Nova Scotia, Canada, as a case study. The model was run using two different sources of data to inform the floral resource component of the model. First, the model was run driven by proxies and approximate values gathered from the literature. The second iteration of the model utilized field-based data to generate floral resource abundance and distribution values. Both models utilized honey bee-specific species preference data drawn from field observations and expert opinion in the literature. Results indicated an 8.1% increase in the amount of land designated as high quality when the model was informed by field-based data. Such discrepancies are important when considering the potential implications of ecosystem services mapping studies on policy. As a tool, ecosystem services mapping provides the opportunity to spatially evaluate the impact that different land-use planning regimes could have on the supply and provision of various ecosystem services. However, as its popularity rises, it is important to keep in mind the accuracy and resolution of the data used to inform the modelling process. © 2018 The Author(s).

Honey yield of different commercial apiaries treated with Lactobacillus salivarius A3iob, a new bee-probiotic strain	The main objective of this study was to determine the impact of Lactobacillus salivarius A3iob, a honey bee gutassociated strain (GenBank code access KX198010), on honey yield. Independent assays were conducted from May to September 2014 and 2015, in three commercial apiaries: Tilquiza, El Carmen and Yala, all located in north-western Argentina. Local Apis mellifera L. bees were kept in standard Langstroth hives; treated hives were fed once a month with 1×105 cfu/ml viable Lactobacillus cells, administered to the bees through a Doolittle-type feeder in 125 g/l sucrose syrup. Control hives were only given the syrup mixed with MRS sterile broth. The main honey harvest was done in December in all groups and we found that there was an overall increase in honey yield from the treated hives. In 2014, all treated hives produced between 2.3 to 6.5 times more honey than the controls. However, in 2015, higher honey average yields in the treated hives at El Carmen and Yala were obtained, yet not at Tilquiza, because of a slight mishap. They experienced the swarming of several bee colonies due to a higher number of bees without appropriate management, which caused the control group to yield more honey compared to the hives fed with Lactobacillus. Interestingly, at El Carmen, two honey harvests were recorded: one in winter and another in summer (July and December 2015, respectively). This unexpected result arose from the particular flora of the region, mainly Tithonia tubaeformis, which blooms in winter. L. salivarius A3iob cells prove to be a natural alternative that will positively impact the beekeepers' economy by providing a higher honey yield. © 2017 Wageningen Academic Publishers.			2018-01-01
Honey bee (Apis mellifera) nurses do not consume pollens based on their nutritional quality	Honey bee workers (Apis mellifera) consume a variety of pollens to meet the majority of their requirements for protein and lipids. Recent work indicates that honey bees prefer diets that reflect the proper ratio of nutrients necessary for optimal survival and homeostasis. This idea relies on the precept that honey bees evaluate the nutritional composition of the foods provided to them. While this has been shown in bumble bees, the data for honey bees are mixed. Further, there is controversy as to whether foragers can evaluate the nutritional value of pollens, especially if they do not consume it. Here, we focused on nurse workers, who eat most of the pollen coming into the hive. We tested the hypothesis that nurses prefer diets with higher nutritional value. We first determined the nutritional profile, number of plant taxa (richness), and degree of hypopharyngeal gland (HG) growth conferred by three honey bee collected pollens. We then presented nurses with these same three pollens in paired choice assays and measured consumption. To further test whether nutrition influenced preference, we also presented bees with natural pollens supplemented with protein or lipids and liquid diets with protein and lipid ratios equal to the natural pollens. Different pollens conferred different degrees of HG growth, but despite these differences, nurse bees did not always prefer the most nutritious pollens. Adding protein and/or lipids to less desirable pollens minimally increased pollen attractiveness, and nurses did not exhibit a strong preference for any of the three liquid diets. We conclude that different pollens provide different nutritional benefits, but that nurses either cannot or do not assess pollen nutritional value. This implies that the nurses may not be able to communicate information about pollen quality to the foragers, who regulate the pollens coming into the hive.

Mitigating effects of pollen during paraquat exposure on gene expression and pathogen prevalence in Apis mellifera L	Honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) populations have been experiencing notable mortality in Europe and North America. No single cause has been identified for these dramatic losses, but rather multiple interacting factors are likely responsible (such as pesticides, malnutrition, habitat loss, and pathogens). Paraquat is one of the most widely used non-selective herbicides, especially in developing countries. This herbicide is considered slightly toxic to honey bees, despite being reported as a highly effective inducer of oxidative stress in a wide range of living systems. Here, we test the effects of paraquat on the expression of detoxification and antioxidant-related genes, as well as on the dynamics of pathogen titers. Moreover, we tested the effects of pollen as mitigating factor to paraquat exposure. Our results show significant changes in the expression of several antioxidant-related and detoxification-related genes in the presence of paraquat, as well as an increase of pathogens titers. Finally, we demonstrate a mitigating effect of pollen through the up-regulation of specific genes and improvement of survival of bees exposed to paraquat. The presence of pollen in the diet was also correlated with a reduced prevalence of Nosema and viral pathogens. We discuss the importance of honey bees’ nutrition, especially the availability of pollen, on colony losses chronically reported in the USA and Europe. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.		complementary DNA, paraquat, antioxidant, herbicide, paraquat, antioxidant, bee, detoxification, disease prevalence, gene expression, oxidative stress, paraquat, pathogen, pollen, pollution exposure, viral disease, Apis mellifera, Article, concentration (parameters), controlled study, detoxification, diet, down regulation, exposure, gene expression, genetic screening, mortality, nonhuman, Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae, oxidative stress, pathogen load, pollen, priority journal, RNA isolation, survival rate, upregulation, animal, bee, gene expression, metabolism, microbiology, Nosema, physiology, pollen, virology, Europe, United States, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Nosema, Animals, Antioxidants, Bees, Gene Expression, Herbicides, Nosema, Paraquat, Pollen	2018-01-01
Effect of pollen extract supplementation on the varroatosis tolerance of honey bee (Apis mellifera) larvae reared in vitro	As the main source of lipids and proteins in honey bees, pollen is a major nutrient provider involved in development and health and has been studied for tolerance stimulation against pathogens and parasites. In the case of Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman (Acari, Mesostigmata: Varroidae) parasitization, the lack of a complete laboratory system to rear both the bee larva and the acarian parasite limited the studies concerning larval nutrition effects on the bee tolerance and resistance against varroatosis. Due to the development of this complete rearing protocol, we managed to feed young honey bee larvae with pollen supplemented solutions and to study the effect on their later development under parasitism conditions. In our experimental conditions, pollen influences neither the deformity rate, nor the survival of bees both parasitized and unparasitized. However, pollen extract supplementation seems to significantly impact the weight of the spinning bee larvae without having an effect on the physiological weight loss during pupation, so the differences found at the larval stage remain the same as at emergence. Varroa has a deleterious effect on bee pupae and led to a steady increase of the physiological weight loss experienced during metamorphosis. Interestingly, this ponderal loss associated with Varroa parasitization seems to be reduced in the polyfloral pollen supplementation condition. Altogether, this work is to our knowledge the first to study in laboratory conditions the impact of larval nutrition on the tolerance to parasitism. A diverse pollen diet may be beneficial to the bees’ tolerance against V. destructor parasitism. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.			2018-01-01
The first report of the prevalence of Nosema ceranae in Bulgaria	Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae are the two main microsporidian parasites causing nosematosis in the honey bee Apis mellifera. The aim of the present study is to investigate the presence of Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae in the area of Bulgaria. The 16S (SSU) rDNA gene region was chosen for analysis. A duplex PCR assay was performed on 108 honey bee samples from three different parts of the country (South, North and West Bulgaria). The results showed that the samples from the northern part of the country were with the highest prevalence (77.2%) for Nosema ceranae while those from the mountainous parts (the Rodopa Mountains, South Bulgaria) were with the lowest rate (13.9%). Infection with Nosema apis alone and co-infection N. apis/N. ceranae were not detected in any samples. These findings suggest that Nosema ceranae is the dominant species in the Bulgarian honey bee. It is not known when the introduction of Nosema ceranae in Bulgaria has occurred, but as in the rest of the world, this species has become the dominant one in Bulgarian Apis mellifera. In conclusion, this is the first report for molecular detection of Nosema infection of honey bee in Bulgaria. The results showed that N. ceranae is the main Nosema species in Bulgaria. © 2018 Shumkova et al.

Decline of bumble bees in northeastern North America, with special focus on Bombus terricola	Concerns about the rapid and severe declines of many bumble bee (Bombus spp.) species in Europe, and more recently North America, have spurred research into the extent and possible causes for these losses. Drawing conclusions has been difficult due to a lack of long-term data, especially for specific regions that may have different factors at play than the global trend. In this study, 150 years of Bombus records in the state of New Hampshire from the University of New Hampshire Insect Collection were examined. This allowed for changes in abundance and distribution to be tracked over time, with focus on species designated of greatest conservation need by NH Fish & Game Department. Floral records also provided insight into the diet breadth of these species, which may affect their vulnerability. Evidence of drastic decline was found in Bombus affinis, Bombus fervidus, and Bombus terricola, as well as significant decline in Bombus vagans with data suggesting it has been ecologically replaced by Bombus impatiens over time. We suggest Bombus vagans receive future conservation consideration. Our analyses found a severe constriction of the geographic range of Bombus terricola to high elevation regions in the latter half of the 20th century, and its role as pollinator of several alpine plants necessitates immediate conservation action. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd		abundance, bee, conservation management, conservation status, home range, museum, pollinator, population decline, population distribution, species conservation, vulnerability, Europe, New Hampshire, North America, United States, Apoidea, Bombus (genus), Bombus fervidus, Bombus impatiens, Bombus terricola, Bombus vagans, Hexapoda	2018-01-01
Comparative chronic toxicity of three neonicotinoids on New Zealand packaged honey bees	Background Thiamethoxam, clothianidin, and imidacloprid are the most commonly used neonicotinoid insecticides on the Canadian prairies. There is widespread contamination of nectar and pollen with neonicotinoids, at concentrations which are sublethal for honey bees (Apis mellifera Linnaeus). Objective We compared the effects of chronic, sublethal exposure to the three most commonly used neonicotinoids on honey bee colonies established from New Zealand packaged bees using colony weight gain, brood area, and population size as measures of colony performance. Methods From May 7 to July 29, 2016 (12 weeks), sixty-eight colonies received weekly feedings of sugar syrup and pollen patties containing 0 nM, 20 nM (median environmental dose), or 80 nM (high environmental dose) of one of three neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam, clothianidin, and imidacloprid). Colonies were weighed at three-week intervals. Brood area and population size were determined from digital images of colonies at week 12. Statistical analyses were performed by ANOVA and mixed models. Results There was a significant negative effect (-30%, p<0.01) on colony weight gain (honey production) after 9 and 12 weeks of exposure to 80 nM of thiamethoxam, clothianidin, or imidacloprid and on bee cluster size (-21%, p<0.05) after 12 weeks. Analysis of brood area and number of adult bees lacked adequate (>80%) statistical power to detect an effect. Conclusions Chronic exposure of honey bees to high environmental doses of neonicotinoids has negative effects on honey production. Brood area appears to be less sensitive to detect sublethal effects of neonicotinoids. © 2018 Wood et al.

Impact of beneficial bacteria supplementation on the gut microbiota, colony development and productivity of Apis mellifera L.	Honey bees are important pollinators of several crops and ecosystems, having a great ecological and economic value. In Europe, the restricted use of chemicals and therapeutic agents in the beekeeping sector has stimulated the search for natural alternatives with a special focus on gut symbionts. The modulation of the gut microbiota has been recognised as a practical and successful approach in the entomological field for the management of insectrelated problems. To date, only a few studies have investigated the effect of bacterial supplementation on the health status of colonies, colony productivity and gut symbionts. To this purpose, a preparation of sugar syrup containing bifidobacteria and lactobacilli isolated from bee gut was sprayed on the frames of an apiary located in open field once a week for four weeks. Treated and control hives were monitored for two months for brood extension, honey and pollen harvest. The presence of beneficial gut microorganisms within bee gut was investigated with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and next generation sequencing. The administered bacteria led to a significant increase of brood population (46.2%), pollen (53.4%) and harvestable honey in honey supers (59.21%). Analysis of the gut microbiota on the new generation of bees in treated hives showed an increase in relative abundance of Acetobacteraceae and Bifidobacterium spp., which are known to be involved in bee nutrition and protection. © 2017 Wageningen Academic Publishers.			2018-01-01
COREMIC: A web-tool to search for a niche associated CORE MICrobiome	Microbial diversity on earth is extraordinary, and soils alone harbor thousands of species per gram of soil. Understanding how this diversity is sorted and selected into habitat niches is a major focus of ecology and biotechnology, but remains only vaguely understood. A systems-biology approach was used to mine information from databases to show how it can be used to answer questions related to the core microbiome of habitat-microbe relationships. By making use of the burgeoning growth of information from databases, our tool "COREMIC" meets a great need in the search for understanding niche partitioning and habitat-function relationships. The work is unique, furthermore, because it provides a user-friendly statistically robust web-tool (http://coremic2.appspot.com or http://core-mic.com), developed using Google App Engine, to help in the process of database mining to identify the "core microbiome" associated with a given habitat. A case study is presented using data from 31 switchgrass rhizosphere community habitats across a diverse set of soil and sampling environments. The methodology utilizes an outgroup of 28 non-switchgrass (other grasses and forbs) to identify a core switchgrass microbiome. Even across a diverse set of soils (five environments), and conservative statistical criteria (presence in more than 90% samples and FDR q-val < 0.05% for Fisher's exact test) a core set of bacteria associated with switchgrass was observed. These included, among others, closely related taxa from Lysobacter spp., Mesorhizobium spp, and Chitinophagaceae. These bacteria have been shown to have functions related to the production of bacterial and fungal antibiotics and plant growth promotion. COREMIC can be used as a hypothesis generating or confirmatory tool that shows great potential for identifying taxa that may be important to the functioning of a habitat (e.g. host plant). The case study, in conclusion, shows that COREMIC can identify key habitat-specific microbes across diverse samples, using currently available databases and a unique freely available software. © 2018 Rodrigues et al.			2018-01-01
The impact of restrictions on neonicotinoid and fipronil insecticides on pest management in maize, oilseed rape and sunflower in eight European Union regions	BACKGROUND: In 2013, the European Commission restricted the use of three neonicotinoids (clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) and the pyrazole fipronil, which are widely used to control early-season pests. Here, we used original farm survey data to examine the impact of the restrictions on pest management practices in eight regional case studies including maize, oilseed rape and sunflower in seven European Union (EU) countries. RESULTS: In four case studies, farmers switched to using untreated seeds as no alternative seed treatments were available. In three case studies, farmers switched to using unrestricted neonicotinoid- or pyrethroid-treated seeds. In five case studies, farmers increased the use of soil or foliar treatments, with pyrethroids as the principal insecticide class. Other changes in pest management practices ranged from increased sowing density to more frequent scouting for pests. Many farmers perceived that the time, cost and amount of insecticides required to protect crops increased, along with pest pressure. Alternative seed treatments were mostly perceived as being less effective than the restricted seed treatments. CONCLUSION: Farmers generally relied on alternative seed treatments or more soil/foliar treatments in the first growing season after the restrictions took effect. Further study is required to assess the effectiveness and sustainability of these alternatives compared with the restricted insecticides. © 2017 The Authors.

Metabolisation of thiamethoxam (a neonicotinoid pesticide) and interaction with the Chronic bee paralysis virus in honeybees	Pathogens and pesticides are likely to co-occur in honeybee hives, but much remains to be investigated regarding their potential interactions. Here, we first investigated the metabolisation kinetics of thiamethoxam in chronically fed honeybees. We show that thiamethoxam, at a dose of 0.25 ng/bee/day, is quickly and effectively metabolised into clothianidin, throughout a 20 day exposure period. Using a similar chronic exposure to pesticide, we then studied, in a separate experiment, the impact of thiamethoxam and Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) co-exposure in honeybees. The honeybees were exposed to the virus by contact, mimicking the natural transmission route in the hive. We demonstrate that a high dose of thiamethoxam (5.0 ng/bee/day) can cause a synergistic increase in mortality in co-exposed honeybees after 8 to 10 days of exposure, with no increase in viral loads. At a lower dose (2.5 ng/bee/day), there was no synergistic increase of mortality, but viral loads were significantly higher in naturally dead honeybees, compared with sacrificed honeybees exposed to the same conditions. These results show that the interactions between pathogens and pesticides in honeybees can be complex: increasing pesticide doses may not necessarily be linked to a rise in viral loads, suggesting that honeybee tolerance to the viral infection might change with pesticide exposure. © 2017 The Authors			2018-01-01
Bacterial communities associated with the ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor and Tropilaelaps mercedesae of the honey bee (Apis mellifera)	Varroa and Tropilaelaps mites have been reported as serious ectoparasites of the honey bee (Apis mellifera). In this study, bacterial communities associated with Varroa destructor and Tropilaelaps mercedesae from northern Thailand were determined, using both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. Adult female mites were collected from apiaries in Chiang Mai and Lampang provinces. Culturable bacteria were isolated from individual mites. On average, we observed approximately 1340 and 1140 CFU/mite in Varroa and Tropilaelaps, respectively. All isolates were assigned to the genus Enterococcus. Six samples of genomic DNA from 30-50 mites were extracted and subjected to pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons. The resulting 81 717 sequences obtained from Varroa were grouped into 429 operational taxonomic units. The most abundant bacteria in Varroa mites belonged to the family Enterobacteriaceae, especially the genera Arsenophonus, Enterobacter and Proteus. For Tropilaelaps mites, 84 075 sequences were obtained and clustered into 166 operational taxonomic units, within which the family Enterococcaceae (particularly the genus Enterococcus) was predominant. Localization of bacteria in the mites using fluorescence in situ hybridization with two universal bacterial probes revealed that these bacteria were in the cecum of the mites. Taxon-specific Enterobacteriaceae and Arsenophonus probes also confirmed their localization in the cecum of Varroa. © FEMS 2017.		abundance, bacterium, bioassay, digestive system, DNA, ectoparasite, genetic analysis, honeybee, microbial community, mite, Chiang Mai [Northern Region], Lampang, Northern Region [Thailand], Thailand, Acari, Apis mellifera, Arsenophonus, Bacteria (microorganisms), Enterobacter, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae, Enterococcus, Proteus (enterobacteria), Tropilaelaps, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2018-01-01
Increased survival of honeybees in the laboratory after simultaneous exposure to low doses of pesticides and bacteria	Recent studies of honeybees and bumblebees have examined combinatory effects of different stressors, as insect pollinators are naturally exposed to multiple stressors. At the same time the potential influences of simultaneously occurring agricultural agents on insect pollinator health remain largely unknown. Due to different farming methods, and the drift of applied agents and manure, pollinators are most probably exposed to insecticides but also bacteria from organic fertilizers at the same time. We orally exposed honeybee workers to sub-lethal doses of the insecticide thiacloprid and two strains of the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis, which can occur in manure from farming animals. Our results show that under laboratory conditions the bees simultaneously exposed to the a bacterium and the pesticide thiacloprid thiacloprid had significant higher survival rates 11 days post exposure than the controls, which surprisingly showed the lowest survival. Bees that were exposed to diet containing thiacloprid showed decreased food intake. General antibacterial activity is increased by the insecticide and the bacteria, resulting in a higher immune response observed in treated individuals compared to control individuals. We thus propose that caloric restriction through behavioural and physiological adaptations may have mediated an improved survival and stress resistance in our tests. However, the decreased food consumption could in long-term also result in possible negative effects at colony level. Our study does not show an additive negative impact of sub-lethal insecticide and bacteria doses, when tested under laboratory conditions. In contrast, we report seemingly beneficial effects of simultaneous exposure of bees to agricultural agents, which might demonstrate a surprising biological capacity for coping with stressors, possibly through hormetic regulation. © 2018 Dickel et al.

Neonicotinoid pesticides and nutritional stress synergistically reduce survival in honey bees	The honey bee is a major pollinator whose health is of global concern. Declines in bee health are related to multiple factors, including resource quality and pesticide contamination. Intensive agricultural areas with crop monocultures potentially reduce the quality and quantity of available nutrients and expose bee foragers to pesticides. However, there is, to date, no evidence for synergistic effects between pesticides and nutritional stress in animals. The neonicotinoids clothianidin (CLO) and thiamethoxam (TMX) are common systemic pesticides that are used worldwide and found in nectar and pollen. We therefore tested if nutritional stress (limited access to nectar and access to nectar with low-sugar concentrations) and sublethal, field-realistic acute exposures to two neonicotinoids (CLO and TMX at 1/5 and 1/25 of LD50) could alter bee survival, food consumption and haemolymph sugar levels. Bee survival was synergistically reduced by the combination of poor nutrition and pesticide exposure (-50%). Nutritional and pesticide stressors reduced also food consumption (-48%) and haemolymph levels of glucose (-60%) and trehalose (-27%). Our results provide the first demonstration that field-realistic nutritional stress and pesticide exposure can synergistically interact and cause significant harm to animal survival. These findings have implications for current pesticide risk assessment and pollinator protection. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Occurrence of pesticide residues in Spanish beeswax	Beeswax from Spain was collected during 2016 to determine pesticide residues incidence. The 35 samples were divided in foundation, old combs, cappings or virgin beeswax to compare pesticide content between groups. Wax was screened for 58 pesticides or their degradation products by QuEChERS extraction and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Beeswax was uniformly contaminated with acaricides and, to a much lesser extent, with insecticide and fungicide residues. Virgin followed by cappings were less contaminated than foundation and old combs beeswax. The miticides applied in-hive had a contribution to average pesticide load higher than 95%. Compounds widely used as acaricides, as coumaphos (100%), fluvalinate (86%) and amitraz (83%), were the pesticides most frequently detected with maximum concentrations of 26,858, 3593 and 6884 ng·g− 1, respectively. Chlorfenvinphos, acrinathrin and flumethrin, also acaricides, were detected in 77, 71 and 54%, respectively. Frequencies of pesticides used in crops were 40% for chlorpyrifos, 29% for dichlofenthion, 9% for malathion, 6% for fenthion-sulfoxide and 3% for azinphos-methyl, carbendazim, ethion, hexythiazox, imazalil and pyriproxyfen. Pesticide assessment in beeswax could be an excellent monitoring tool to establish veterinary treatments applied by beekeepers and environmental contaminants exposure of honey bees. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Presence of Apis rhabdovirus-1 in populations of pollinators and their parasites from two continents	The viral ecology of bee communities is complex, where viruses are readily shared among co-foraging bee species. Additionally, in honey bees (Apis mellifera), many viruses are transmitted - and their impacts exacerbated - by the parasitic Varroa destructor mite. Thus far, the viruses found to be shared across bee species and transmitted by V. destructor mites are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Recently, a negative-sense RNA enveloped virus, Apis rhabdovirus-1 (ARV-1), was found in A. mellifera honey bees in Africa, Europe, and islands in the Pacific. Here, we describe the identification - using a metagenomics approach - of ARV-1 in two bee species (A. mellifera and Bombus impatiens) and in V. destructor mites from populations collected in the United States and Israel. We confirmed the presence of ARV-1 in pools of A. mellifera, B. impatiens, and V. destructor from Israeli and U.S. populations by RT-PCR and found that it can reach high titers in individual honey bees and mites (107-108 viral genomic copies per individual). To estimate the prevalence of ARV-1 in honey bee populations, we screened 104 honey bee colonies across Israel, with 21 testing ARV-1-positive. Tagged-primer-mediated RT-PCR analysis detected the presence of the positive-sense ARV-1 RNA in A. mellifera and V. destructor, indicating that ARV-1 replicates in both hosts. This is the first report of the presence of ARV-1 in B. impatiens and of the replication of a rhabdovirus in A. mellifera and V. destructor. Our data suggest that Varroa mites could act as an ARV-1 vector; however, the presence of ARV-1 in B. impatiens (which are not parasitized by Varroa) suggests that it may not require the mite for transmission and ARV-1 may be shared among co-foraging bee species. Given that ARV-1 is found in non-Apis bee species, and because "ARV" is used for the Adelaide River virus, we propose that this virus should be called bee rhabdovirus 1 and abbreviated BRV-1. These results greatly expand our understanding of the diversity of viruses that can infect bee communities, though further analysis is required to determine how infection with this virus impacts these different hosts. © 2017 Levin, Galbraith, Sela, Erez, Grozinger and Chejanovsky.		transcriptome, Apis mellifera, Article, Bombus impatiens, DNA sequence, nonhuman, parasite, population, prevalence, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Rhabdoviridae, rhabdovirus 1, RNA extraction, RNA virus, virus purification, virus replication, virus transmission	2017-12-12
Comparative flight activities and pathogen load of two stocks of honey bees reared in gamma-irradiated combs	Gamma irradiation is known to inactivate various pathogens that negatively affect honey bee health. Bee pathogens, such as Deformed wing virus (DWV) and Nosema spp., have a deleterious impact on foraging activities and bee survival, and have been detected in combs. In this study, we assessed the effects of gamma irradiation on the flight activities, pathogen load, and survival of two honey bee stocks that were reared in irradiated and non-irradiated combs. Overall, bee genotype influenced the average number of daily flights, the total number of foraging flights, and total flight duration, in which the Russian honey bees outperformed the Italian honey bees. Exposing combs to gamma irradiation only affected the age at first flight, with worker bees that were reared in non-irradiated combs foraging prematurely compared to those reared in irradiated combs. Precocious foraging may be associated with the higher levels of DWV in bees reared in non-irradiated combs and also with the lower amount of pollen stores in colonies that used non-irradiated combs. These data suggest that gamma irradiation of combs can help minimize the negative impact of DWV in honey bees. Since colonies with irradiated combs stored more pollen than those with non-irradiated combs, crop pollination efficiency may be further improved when mite-resistant stocks are used, since they performed more flights and had longer flight durations. © 2017 by the authors.

Behavioral responses of honey bees (Apis mellifera) to natural and synthetic xenobiotics in food	While the natural foods of the western honey bee (Apis mellifera) contain diverse phytochemicals, in contemporary agroecosystems honey bees also encounter pesticides as floral tissue contaminants. Whereas some ubiquitous phytochemicals in bee foods up-regulate detoxification and immunity genes, thereby benefiting nestmates, many agrochemical pesticides adversely affect bee health even at sublethal levels. How honey bees assess xenobiotic risk to nestmates as they forage is poorly understood. Accordingly, we tested nine phytochemicals ubiquitous in nectar, pollen, or propolis, as well as five synthetic xenobiotics that frequently contaminate hives-two herbicides (atrazine and glyphosate) and three fungicides (boscalid, chlorothalonil, and prochloraz). In semi-field free-flight experiments, bees were offered a choice between paired sugar water feeders amended with either a xenobiotic or solvent only (control). Among the phytochemicals, foragers consistently preferred quercetin at all five concentrations tested, as evidenced by both visitation frequency and consumption rates. This preference may reflect the long evolutionary association between honey bees and floral tissues. Of pesticides eliciting a response, bees displayed a preference at specific concentrations for glyphosate and chlorothalonil. This paradoxical preference may account for the frequency with which these pesticides occur as hive contaminants and suggests that they present a greater risk factor for honey bee health than previously suspected. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-12-01
Elucidating the mechanisms underlying the beneficial health effects of dietary pollen on honey bees (Apis mellifera) infested by Varroa mite ectoparasites	Parasites and pathogens of the honey bee (Apis mellifera) are key factors underlying colony losses, which are threatening the beekeeping industry and agriculture as a whole. To control the spread and development of pathogen infections within the colony, honey bees use plant resins with antibiotic activity, but little is known about the properties of other substances, that are mainly used as a foodstuff, for controlling possible diseases both at the individual and colony level. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that pollen is beneficial for honey bees challenged with the parasitic mite Varroa destructor associated to the Deformed Wing Virus. First, we studied the effects of pollen on the survival of infested bees, under laboratory and field conditions, and observed that a pollen rich diet can compensate the deleterious effects of mite parasitization. Subsequently, we characterized the pollen compounds responsible for the observed positive effects. Finally, based on the results of a transcriptomic analysis of parasitized bees fed with pollen or not, we developed a comprehensive framework for interpreting the observed effects of pollen on honey bee health, which incorporates the possible effects on cuticle integrity, energetic metabolism and immune response. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-12-01
Recent spread of Varroa destructor virus-1, a honey bee pathogen, in the United States	RNA viruses impact honey bee health and contribute to elevated colony loss rates worldwide. Deformed wing virus (DWV) and the closely related Varroa destructor virus-1 (VDV1), are the most widespread honey bee viruses. VDV1 is known to cause high rates of overwintering colony losses in Europe, however it was unknown in the United States (US). Using next generation sequencing, we identified VDV1 in honey bee pupae in the US. We tested 603 apiaries the US in 2016 and found that VDV1 was present in 66.0% of them, making it the second most prevalent virus after DWV, which was present in 89.4% of the colonies. VDV1 had the highest load in infected bees (7.45∗1012 ± 1.62∗ 1012 average copy number ± standard error) compared to other tested viruses, with DWV second (1.04∗ 1012 ± 0.53∗ 1012). Analysis of 75 colonies sourced in 2010 revealed that VDV1 was present in only 2 colonies (2.7%), suggesting its recent spread. We also detected newly emerged recombinants between the US strains of VDV1 and DWV. The presence of these recombinants poses additional risk, because similar VDV1-DWV recombinants constitute the most virulent honeybee viruses in the UK. © 2017 The Author(s).		honeybee, infectious agent, next generation sequencing, nonhuman, pupa, United States, Varroa destructor, virus recombinant, wing	2017-12-01
A Varroa destructor protein atlas reveals molecular underpinnings of developmental transitions and sexual differentiation	Varroa destructor is the most economically damaging honey bee pest, weakening colonies by simultaneously parasitizing bees and transmitting harmful viruses. Despite these impacts on honey bee health, surprisingly little is known about its fundamental molecular biology. Here, we present a Varroa protein atlas crossing all major developmental stages (egg, protonymph, deutonymph, and adult) for both male and female mites as a web-based interactive tool (http://foster.nce.ubc.ca/varroa/index.html). We used intensity-based label-free quantitation to find 1,433 differentially expressed proteins across developmental stages. Enzymes for processing carbohydrates and amino acids were among many of these differences as well as proteins involved in cuticle formation. Lipid transport involving vitellogenin was the most significantly enriched biological process in the foundress (reproductive female) and young mites. In addition, we found that 101 proteins were sexually regulated and functional enrichment analysis suggests that chromatin remodeling may be a key feature of sex determination. In a proteogenomic effort, we identified 519 protein-coding regions, 301 of which were supported by two or more peptides and 169 of which were differentially expressed. Overall, this work provides a first-of-its-kind interrogation of the patterns of protein expression that govern the Varroa life cycle and the tools we have developed will support further research on this threatening honey bee pest. © 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.		amino acid, carbohydrate, vitellogenin, Article, biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism, developmental stage, enzyme activity, female, honeybee, limit of quantitation, lipid transport, male, nonhuman, priority journal, protein analysis, protein expression, protein function, proteogenomics, sex differentiation, Varroa destructor	2017-12-01
Peptide biomarkers used for the selective breeding of a complex polygenic trait in honey bees	We present a novel way to select for highly polygenic traits. For millennia, humans have used observable phenotypes to selectively breed stronger or more productive livestock and crops. Selection on genotype, using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genome profiling, is also now applied broadly in livestock breeding programs; however, selection on protein/peptide or mRNA expression markers has not yet been proven useful. Here we demonstrate the utility of protein markers to select for disease-resistant hygienic behavior in the European honey bee (Apis mellifera L.). Robust, mechanistically-linked protein expression markers, by integrating cis- A nd trans- effects from many genomic loci, may overcome limitations of genomic markers to allow for selection. After three generations of selection, the resulting marker-selected stock outperformed an unselected benchmark stock in terms of hygienic behavior, and had improved survival when challenged with a bacterial disease or a parasitic mite, similar to bees selected using a phenotype-based assessment for this trait. This is the first demonstration of the efficacy of protein markers for industrial selective breeding in any agricultural species, plant or animal. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-12-01
An abbreviated SNP panel for ancestry assignment of honeybees (Apis mellifera)	We examine whether a panel of 37 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has the same power as a more expensive panel of 95 SNPs to assign ancestry of honeybees (Apis mellifera) to three ancestral lineages. We selected SNPs using allele frequencies, such that poorly performing SNPs were excluded. We find that ancestry assignment is comparable between the two panels. Importation of bee semen from countries where Africanized bees are present into countries where Africanized bees are absent would be facilitated if small proportions of semen derived from Africanized drones can be reliably detected. We used the abbreviated panel to determine if semen from a single Africanized drone could be detected when mixed with the semen of 10, 20 or 40 non-Africanized drones. We found that the use of the 37 SNP test on a mixed sample would fail to detect the contribution of a single Africanized male. It is therefore important that the cadavers of the males contributing semen are individually tested. © 2017, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		allele, ancestry, facilitation, genetic analysis, genetic marker, honeybee, population genetics, Apis mellifera, Apis mellifera scutellata, Apoidea	2017-12-01
Apitoxin harvest impairs hypopharyngeal gland structure in Apis mellifera honey bees	Apitoxin harvesting is a stressful practice for honey bees Apis mellifera L. due to the release of alarm pheromones that alter communication and behaviour and may also affect their physiology. Thus, the goal of this research was to verify the effects of apitoxin harvesting on the development of the hypopharyngeal glands (HGs), evaluating the number and area of acini. For this, ten beehives were subjected to one of two treatments: T1, without apitoxin harvest and T2, with apitoxin harvested by an electric collector. We collected ten 6-day-old honey bees in each treatment once every month (October through December). The HGs were removed and were processed for morphological-stereological analysis. The worker bees from hives subjected to treatment T2 showed a smaller acinar area and lower number of acini than those from hives subjected to treatment T1. Thus, apitoxin harvest negatively affects the structure of the hypopharyngeal glands, consequently affecting the production of royal jelly. © 2017, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		anatomy, apiculture, equipment, experimental study, honeybee, morphology, nutrition, pheromone, Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2017-12-01
Temporal dynamics of whole body residues of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid in live or dead honeybees	In cases of acute intoxication, honeybees often lay in front of their hives for several days, exposed to sunlight and weather, before a beekeeper can take a sample. Beekeepers send samples to analytical laboratories, but sometimes no residues can be detected. Temperature and sun light could influence the decrease of pesticides in bee samples and thereby residues left for analysis. Moreover, samples are usually sent via normal postal services without cooling. We investigated the temporal dynamics of whole-body residues of imidacloprid in live or dead honeybees following a single-meal dietary exposure of 41 ng/bee under various environmental conditions, such as freezing, exposure to UV light or transfer of individuals through the mail system. Immobile, "dead" looking honeybees recovered from paralysis after 48 hours. The decrease of residues in living but paralysed bees was stopped by freezing (= killing). UV light significantly reduced residues, but the mode of transport did not affect residue levels. Group feeding increased the variance of residues, which is relevant for acute oral toxicity tests. In conclusion, elapsed time after poisoning is key for detection of neonicotinoids. Freezing before mailing significantly reduced the decrease of imidacloprid residues and may increase the accuracy of laboratory analysis for pesticides. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-12-01
Chemical characterization and acaricidal activity of Thymus satureioides C. &amp; B. and Origanum elongatum E. &amp; M. (Lamiaceae) essential oils against Varroa destructor Anderson &amp; Trueman (Acari: Varroidae)	Thymus satureioides and Origanum elongatum, endemic, aromatic and sources of honey in Morocco, are rich in essential oils (EOs). In Southwest, Varroa destructor affects less bee colonies foraging in thyme (Thymus satureioides) formations. The aim of this study was (i) to determine the composition of T. satureioides and O. elongatum EOs in relation to origins and phenological stages and (ii) to investigate the acaricidal activity against Varroa destructor. Essential oils obtained showed differences in the chemical composition according to plant species but did not vary drastically with the vegetative stage of growth and origins. The main constituents found in T. satureioides EOs were borneol (20.07%–48.23%) and α-terpineol (5.12%–18.16%), smaller amounts of camphen (5.10%–14.44%) and α-pinene (2.43%–7.63%), whereas thymol (0.14%–8.64%) or carvacrol (0.88%–15.23%). O. elongatum EOs contained carvacrol (67.34%–81.72%), γ-terpinene (3.29%–10.75%), para-cymene (3.62%–7.81%) and thymol (1.79%–9.17%). The apiary tests revealed a variable efficacy from 50 to 94% depending on the composition of essential oils. EOs with carvacrol as major compound produced a better effect than other EOs with dominant borneol. However, the blend containing high levels of carvacrol (55.35%) and borneol (20.60%) exhibited much higher activity than all treatments. A synergistic effect between the compounds of T. satureioides and O. elongatum EOs was highlighted. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Efficacy of extracts from eight economically important forestry species against grapevine downy mildew (Plasmopara viticola) and identification of active constituents	Downy mildew caused by the oomycete Plasmopara viticola is the most devastating pathogen of grapevine. In this study, extracts of the bark of eight important northern forestry species were screened to find extracts showing activity against this pathogen and to identify the active compounds. Extracts from all eight species showed activity against P. viticola, the most promising, dichloromethane extracts of three Larix species, almost completely protecting grapevine from downy mildew under semi-controlled conditions. Five promising lead compounds were isolated: larixol, larixyl acetate, lariciresinol and lariciresinol acetate from Larix species and 7α,15-dihydroxydehydroabietic acid from Pinus sylvestris. These compounds showed 90%–100% efficacy. Larixol and larixyl acetate or 7α,15-dihydroxydehydroabietic acid are present in significant amounts in Larix or P. sylvestris bark extracts, respectively. The identified active compounds are gained from a renewable resource potentially available in large quantities at relatively low prices, making them interesting candidates for the development of a plant-derived fungicide active against a key pathogen in agriculture, providing an opportunity to the forest industry to transform low value by-products into high value-added, bioactive extracts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd		Larix, Peronosporaceae, Pinus sylvestris, Plasmopara viticola, Vitis	2017-12-01
Immunosuppression in Honeybee Queens by the Neonicotinoids Thiacloprid and Clothianidin	Queen health is crucial to colony survival of honeybees, since reproduction and colony growth rely solely on the queen. Queen failure is considered a relevant cause of colony losses, yet few data exist concerning effects of environmental stressors on queens. Here we demonstrate for the first time that exposure to field-realistic concentrations of neonicotinoid pesticides can severely affect the immunocompetence of queens of western honeybees (Apis mellifera L.). In young queens exposed to thiacloprid (200 μg/l or 2000 μg/l) or clothianidin (10 μg/l or 50 μg/l), the total hemocyte number and the proportion of active, differentiated hemocytes was significantly reduced. Moreover, functional aspects of the immune defence namely the wound healing/melanisation response, as well as the antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph were impaired. Our results demonstrate that neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect the immunocompetence of queens, possibly leading to an impaired disease resistance capacity. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-12-01
Virus and dsRNA-triggered transcriptional responses reveal key components of honey bee antiviral defense	Recent high annual losses of honey bee colonies are associated with many factors, including RNA virus infections. Honey bee antiviral responses include RNA interference and immune pathway activation, but their relative roles in antiviral defense are not well understood. To better characterize the mechanism(s) of honey bee antiviral defense, bees were infected with a model virus in the presence or absence of dsRNA, a virus associated molecular pattern. Regardless of sequence specificity, dsRNA reduced virus abundance. We utilized next generation sequencing to examine transcriptional responses triggered by virus and dsRNA at three time-points post-infection. Hundreds of genes exhibited differential expression in response to co-treatment of dsRNA and virus. Virus-infected bees had greater expression of genes involved in RNAi, Toll, Imd, and JAK-STAT pathways, but the majority of differentially expressed genes are not well characterized. To confirm the virus limiting role of two genes, including the well-characterized gene, dicer, and a probable uncharacterized cyclin dependent kinase in honey bees, we utilized RNAi to reduce their expression in vivo and determined that virus abundance increased, supporting their involvement in antiviral defense. Together, these results further our understanding of honey bee antiviral defense, particularly the role of a non-sequence specific dsRNA-mediated antiviral pathway. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-12-01
Larval honey bees infected with Nosema ceranae have increased vitellogenin titers as young adults	Nosema ceranae is a pervasive and widespread honey bee pathogen that is associated with colony declines and has recently been shown to infect larval honey bees. In adult bees, Nosema infection is known to alter levels of a key protein, vitellogenin (Vg), which is necessary for egg-laying in queens, brood food production in workers, and proper immune function in all female bees. We therefore tested the effects of larval worker infection on hemolymph Vg titers. In 1-day old adult workers that were infected as larvae with 10,000 (10 K) or 40,000 (40 K) live N. ceranae spores/bee, Vg titers were significantly elevated by + 83% and + 73%, respectively, as compared to controls. At 7 days of adult age, Vg remained significantly elevated (+ 68%) in 10 K treated workers as compared to control workers. Nosema infection decreased total hemolymph protein titers in 1 and 7-day old adult bees (-50% in the 10 K and 40 K treated bees). Bees infected as larvae also had a more queen-like sting morphology. They developed slightly but significantly fewer barbs on their stings (-7% in the 40K-treated bees). Higher Vg levels are associated with younger bees. Thus, elevated Vg levels could delay normal age polyethism and disrupt colony balance. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-12-01
Single-stranded RNA viruses infecting the invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile	Social insects host a diversity of viruses. We examined New Zealand populations of the globally widely distributed invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) for RNA viruses. We used metatranscriptomic analysis, which identified six potential novel viruses in the Dicistroviridae family. Of these, three contigs were confirmed by Sanger sequencing as Linepithema humile virus-1 (LHUV-1), a novel strain of Kashmir bee virus (KBV) and Black queen cell virus (BQCV), while the others were chimeric or misassembled sequences. We extended the known sequence of LHUV-1 to confirm its placement in the Dicistroviridae and categorised its relationship to closest relatives, which were all viruses infecting Hymenoptera. We examined further for known viruses by mapping our metatranscriptomic sequences to all viral genomes, and confirmed KBV, BQCV, LHUV-1 and Deformed wing virus (DWV) presence using qRT-PCR. Viral replication was confirmed for DWV, KBV and LHUV-1. Viral titers in ants were higher in the presence of honey bee hives. Argentine ants appear to host a range of' honey bee' pathogens in addition to a virus currently described only from this invasive ant. The role of these viruses in the population dynamics of the ant remain to be determined, but offer potential targets for biocontrol approaches. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-12-01
Invasive plants as potential food resource for native pollinators: A case study with two invasive species and a generalist bumble bee	It is now well established that invasive plants may induce drifts in the quantity and/or quality of floral resources. They are then often pointed out as a potential driver of bee decline. However, their impact on bee population remains quite unclear and still controversial, as bee responses are highly variable among species. Here, we compared the amino acid composition of pollen from three native and two invasive plant species included in diets of common pollinators in NW Europe. Moreover, the nutritional intake (i.e., pollen and amino acid intakes) of Bombus terrestris colonies and the pollen foraging behaviour of workers (i.e., visiting rate, number of foraging trips, weight of pollen loads) were considered. We found significant differences in pollen nutrients among the studied species according to the plant invasive behaviour. We also found significant differences in pollen foraging behaviour according to the plant species, from few to several foraging trips carrying small or large pollen loads. Such behavioural differences directly impacted the pollen intake but depended more likely on plant morphology rather than on plant invasive behaviour. These results suggest that common generalist bumble bees might not always suffer from plant invasions, depending on their behavioural plasticity and nutritional requirements. © 2017 The Author(s).		amino acid composition, amino acid transport, Bombus terrestris, controlled study, diet, dietary intake, Europe, foraging behavior, human, invasive species, nonhuman, nutrient, nutritional requirement, plant structures, plasticity, pollinator, worker	2017-12-01
Colony adaptive response to simulated heat waves and consequences at the individual level in honeybees (Apis mellifera)	Since climate change is expected to bring more severe and frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves, assessing the physiological and behavioural sensitivity of organisms to temperature becomes a priority. We therefore investigated the responses of honeybees, an important insect pollinator, to simulated heat waves (SHW). Honeybees are known to maintain strict brood thermoregulation, but the consequences at the colony and individual levels remain poorly understood. For the first time, we quantified and modelled colony real-time activity and found a 70% increase in foraging activity with SHW, which was likely due to the recruitment of previously inactive bees. Pollen and nectar foraging was not impacted, but an increase in water foragers was observed at the expense of empty bees. Contrary to individual energetic resources, vitellogenin levels increased with SHW, probably to protect bees against oxidative stress. Finally, though immune functions were not altered, we observed a significant decrease in deformed wing virus loads with SHW. In conclusion, we demonstrated that honeybees could remarkably adapt to heat waves without a cost at the individual level and on resource flow. However, the recruitment of backup foraging forces might be costly by lowering the colony buffering capacity against additional environmental pressures. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-12-01
Neonicotinoid-induced pathogen susceptibility is mitigated by Lactobacillus plantarum immune stimulation in a Drosophila melanogaster model	Pesticides are used extensively in food production to maximize crop yields. However, neonicotinoid insecticides exert unintentional toxicity to honey bees (Apis mellifera) that may partially be associated with massive population declines referred to as colony collapse disorder. We hypothesized that imidacloprid (common neonicotinoid; IMI) exposure would make Drosophila melanogaster (an insect model for the honey bee) more susceptible to bacterial pathogens, heat stress, and intestinal dysbiosis. Our results suggested that the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway is necessary for D. melanogaster survival in response to IMI toxicity. IMI exposure induced alterations in the host-microbiota as noted by increased indigenous Acetobacter and Lactobacillus spp. Furthermore, sub-lethal exposure to IMI resulted in decreased D. melanogaster survival when simultaneously exposed to bacterial infection and heat stress (37 °C). This coincided with exacerbated increases in TotA and Dpt (IMD downstream pro-survival and antimicrobial genes, respectively) expression compared to controls. Supplementation of IMI-exposed D. melanogaster with Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 14917 mitigated survival deficits following Serratia marcescens (bacterial pathogen) septic infection. These findings support the insidious toxicity of neonicotinoid pesticides and potential for probiotic lactobacilli to reduce IMI-induced susceptibility to infection. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-12-01
Sublethal Effects of the Neonicotinoid Insecticide Thiamethoxam on the Transcriptome of the Honey Bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae)	Neonicotinoid insecticides are now the most widely used insecticides in the world. Previous studies have indicated that sublethal doses of neonicotinoids impair learning, memory capacity, foraging, and immunocompetence in honey bees (Apis mellifera, Linnaeus) (Hymenoptera: Apidae). Despite these, few studies have been carried out on the molecular effects of neonicotinoids. In this study, we focus on the second-generation neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, which is currently widely used in agriculture to protect crops. Using high-throughput RNA-Seq, we investigated the transcriptome profile of honey bees after subchronic exposure to 10 ppb thiamethoxam over 10 d. In total, 609 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, of which 225 were upregulated and 384 were downregulated. Several genes, including vitellogenin, CSP3, defensin-1, Mrjp1, and Cyp6as5 were selected and further validated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. The functions of some DEGs were identified, and Gene Ontology-enrichment analysis showed that the enriched DEGs were mainly linked to metabolism, biosynthesis, and translation.

Partitioning the roles of CYP6G1 and gut microbes in the metabolism of the insecticide imidacloprid in Drosophila melanogaster	Resistance to insecticides through enhanced metabolism is a worldwide problem. The Cyp6g1 gene of the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a paradigm for the study of metabolic resistance. Constitutive overexpression of this gene confers resistance to several classes of insecticides, including the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (IMI). The metabolism of IMI in this species has been previously shown to yield oxidative and nitro-reduced metabolites. While levels of the oxidative metabolites are correlated with CYP6G1 expression, nitro-reduced metabolites are not, raising the question of how these metabolites are produced. Some IMI metabolites are known to be toxic, making their fate within the insect a second question of interest. These questions have been addressed by coupling the genetic tools of gene overexpression and CRISPR gene knock-out with the mass spectrometric technique, the Twin-Ion Method (TIM). Analysing axenic larvae indicated that microbes living within D. melanogaster are largely responsible for the production of the nitro-reduced metabolites. Knock-out of Cyp6g1 revealed functional redundancy, with some metabolites produced by CYP6G1 still detected. IMI metabolism was shown to produce toxic products that are not further metabolized but readily excreted, even when produced in the Central Nervous System (CNS), highlighting the significance of transport and excretion in metabolic resistance. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-12-01
Honey bee pathogens in Ghana and the presence of contaminated beeswax	A nationwide survey was performed to study the distribution of parasites, pathogens and pesticides in managed honey bee populations in Ghana. When 45 colonies were sampled and inspected for signs of disease, Varroa destructor was the most prevalent parasite (89%; n = 40), all mites corresponding to the Korean haplotype of this pathogen. Aethina tumida (42%; n = 19) and Braula coeca (7%; n = 3) were also detected, as were Melissococcus plutonius and trypanosomatids (7%). By contrast, Nosema spp., Acarapis spp., Ascosphaera apis and Paenibacillus larvae were not detected by molecular screening. Amitraz was the most widely distributed pesticide (75%; n = 23) followed by coumaphos (47%; n = 15), chlorpyrifos (34%; n = 15) and fluvalinate (31%; n = 10). This survey lays the groundwork for further monitoring of honey bee populations in Ghana. © 2017, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		biomonitoring, chlorpyrifos, disease prevalence, epidemiology, honeybee, molecular analysis, pathogen, pesticide, wax, Ghana, Acari, Aethina tumida, Apis mellifera, Ascosphaera apis, Braula coeca, Melissococcus plutonius, Nosema, Paenibacillus larvae, Trypanosomatidae, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2017-12-01
The pesticide flupyradifurone impairs olfactory learning in Asian honey bees (Apis cerana) exposed as larvae or as adults	Relatively little attention has focused on how pesticides may affect Asian honey bees, which provide vital crop pollination services and are key native pollinators. We therefore studied the effects of a relatively new pesticide, flupyradifurone (FLU), which has been developed, in part, because it appears safer for honey bees than neonicotinoids. We tested the effects of FLU on Apis cerana olfactory learning in larvae (lower dose of 0.033 μg/larvae/day over 6 days) and, in a separate experiment, adults (lower dose of 0.066 μg/adult bee/day) at sublethal, field-realistic doses given over 3 days. A worst-case field-realistic dose is 0.44 μg/bee/day. Learning was tested in adult bees. The lower larval dose did not increase mortality, but the lower adult dose resulted in 20% mortality. The lower FLU doses decreased average olfactory learning by 74% (larval treatment) and 48% (adult treatment) and reduced average memory by 48% (larval treatment) and 22% (adult treatment) as compared to controls. FLU at higher doses resulted in similar learning impairments. The effects of FLU, a pesticide that is reported to be safer than neonicotinoids for honey bees, thus deserve greater attention. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-12-01
The challenges of predicting pesticide exposure of honey bees at landscape level	To evaluate the risks of pesticides for pollinators, we must not only evaluate their toxicity but also understand how pollinators are exposed to these xenobiotics in the field. We focused on this last point and modeled honey bee exposure to pesticides at the landscape level. Pollen pellet samples (n = 60) from 40 Belgian apiaries were collected from late July to October 2011 and underwent palynological and pesticide residue analyses. Areas of various crops around each apiary were measured at 4 spatial scales. The most frequently detected pesticides were the fungicides boscalid (n = 19, 31.7%) and pyrimethanil (n = 10, 16.7%) and the insecticide dimethoate (n = 10, 16.7%). We were able to predict exposure probability for boscalid and dimethoate by using broad indicators of cropping intensity, but it remained difficult to identify the precise source of contamination (e.g. specific crops in which the use of the pesticide is authorized). For pyrimethanil, we were not able to build any convincing landscape model that could explain the contamination. Our results, combined with the late sampling period, strongly suggest that pesticides applied to crops unattractive to pollinators, and therefore considered of no risk for them, may be sources of exposure through weeds, drift to neighboring plants, or succeeding crops. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-12-01
Honey bees dance faster for pollen that complements colony essential fatty acid deficiency	Abstract: Honey bee colonies require adequate pollen for maintenance and growth. Pollens vary in nutritional value, and a balanced diet is achieved by mixing pollens with complementary essential nutrients. We tested subjective evaluation of pollens by foragers in colonies deprived of one of two essential fatty acids (eFAs), alpha-linolenic acid (omega-3) or linoleic acid (omega-6). We used four pollens, two rich in omega-3 and two rich in omega-6. A colony in an observation hive was allowed to forage for 2–5 days on a single pollen source. The following day, we repeatedly presented one of three pollens: the same pollen that the bees had been collecting the previous days, a novel pollen that was similarly deficient in omega-3 or omega-6, and a novel pollen that complemented their eFA deficiency. We measured the rate of waggle dances, which reflects on the strength of recruitment effort, of foragers returning to the observation hive from each of the pollens. Dance rates did not differ between the four pollens, but they were the highest to the “complementary” pollen and the lowest to the “same” pollen. Furthermore, this effect was greater for pollen combinations with greater eFA disparity between the same and the complementary pollens. Our findings support the ability of bees to balance colony eFA intake. Conditioning of the proboscis extension response (PER) tests showed that pollen foragers discriminated well between the four pollen odors, but the mechanisms by which bees assess pollen eFA composition remain to be elucidated. Differential dancing would recruit foragers to pollens that balance colony nutritional needs. Significance statement: Honey bee foragers use dance communication to recruit nestmates to floral sources, with higher dance rates representing greater subjective evaluation of the floral source by the dancer. We fed colonies for a few days with a single pollen source, which was poor in one eFA (omega-3 or omega-6) and rich in the other. We then recorded the dances of foragers that collected each of the three pollens: the same pollen that the bees had been collecting the previous days, a novel pollen that was similarly deficient in omega-3 or omega-6, and a novel pollen that complemented their eFA deficiency. Dance rates were the highest to the “complementary” pollen and the lowest to the “same” pollen, showing that a colony could differentially recruit foragers to pollens that balance its nutritional needs. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.		biochemical composition, communication behavior, dietary intake, fatty acid, food selection, honeybee, nutritive value, pollen, social insect, vitamin deficiency, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hexapoda	2017-12-01
Vegetation Management and Host Density Influence Bee-Parasite Interactions in Urban Gardens	Apocephalus borealis phorid flies, a parasitoid of bumble bees and yellow jacket wasps in North America, was recently reported as a novel parasitoid of the honey bee Apis mellifera Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Apidae). Little is known about the ecology of this interaction, including phorid fecundity on bee hosts, whether phorid-bee parasitism is density dependent, and which local habitat and landscape features may correlate with changes in parasitism rates for either bumble or honey bees. We examined the impact of local and landscape drivers and host abundance on phorid parasitism of A. mellifera and the bumble bee Bombus vosnesenskii Radoszkowski (Hymenoptera: Apidae). We worked in 19 urban gardens along the North-Central Coast of California, where phorid parasitism of honey bees was first reported in 2012. We collected and incubated bees for phorid emergence, and surveyed local vegetation, ground cover, and floral characteristics as well as land cover types surrounding gardens. We found that phorid parasitism was higher on bumble bees than on honey bees, and phorids produced nearly twice as many pupae on individual bumble bee hosts than on honey bee hosts. Parasitism of both bumble and honey bees increased with abundance of honey bees in a site. Differences in landscape surroundings did not correlate with parasitism, but local factors related to bee resource provisioning (e.g., tree and shrub abundance) positively correlated with increased parasitism. This research thus helps to document and describe conditions that may have facilitated phorid fly host shift to honey bees and further elucidate how resource provisioning in urban gardens influences bee-parasite interactions. © 2017 The Authors.

ATP-sensitive inwardly rectifying potassium channel regulation of viral infections in honey bees	Honey bees are economically important pollinators of a wide variety of crops that have attracted the attention of both researchers and the public alike due to unusual declines in the numbers of managed colonies in some parts of the world. Viral infections are thought to be a significant factor contributing to these declines, but viruses have proven a challenging pathogen to study in a bee model and interactions between viruses and the bee antiviral immune response remain poorly understood. In the work described here, we have demonstrated the use of flock house virus (FHV) as a model system for virus infection in bees and revealed an important role for the regulation of the bee antiviral immune response by ATP-sensitive inwardly rectifying potassium (KATP) channels. We have shown that treatment with the KATP channel agonist pinacidil increases survival of bees while decreasing viral replication following infection with FHV, whereas treatment with the KATP channel antagonist tolbutamide decreases survival and increases viral replication. Our results suggest that KATP channels provide a significant link between cellular metabolism and the antiviral immune response in bees. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-12-01
Local ecological knowledge reveals effects of policy-driven land use and cover change on beekeepers in Costa Rica	Land use and cover (LUC) change is a major driver of ecosystem service loss worldwide. In response, policymakers have designed conservation strategies that incentivize the establishment and maintenance of LUC types associated with higher ecosystem service provision. Many of these policies also aim to promote social and economic goals such as reducing poverty. Attempts to measure the impact of policy-driven LUC change on stakeholders typically focus only on economic outcomes for landowning participants or aggregate the socio-economic outcomes of diverse groups. In this study, we applied local ecological knowledge (LEK) held by beekeepers in Costa Rica to understand the impact of policy-driven LUC change on this specific group of often non-landowning stakeholders. Beekeeping is a globally important rural livelihood and provides pollination services to crops and wild plants. We synthesized beekeeper LEK using a mixed-methods approach including apiary mapping exercises (n = 215 apiaries), questionnaires (n = 50 participants), and follow-up interviews (n = 21 participants). Our study revealed that some policy-driven LUC changes have limited beekeepers’ access to preferred land uses, such as secondary and mature forests with native trees. Participants reported concern for their livelihoods due to policy-driven spatial and temporal change of floral resources via the establishment of tree plantations, changes in pasture management, and laws that prohibit beekeeping in national parks and reserves. Our study provides evidence of unintended outcomes from land use policies, including Payment for Ecosystem Services, with disproportionate negative impacts on non-landowning residents who depend on natural resources in the landscape for their livelihoods. Our study illustrates potential inequality rising from current incentive mechanisms associated with Payments for Ecosystem Services and other conservation policies and calls for policymakers to consider LUC change impacts on non-landowning stakeholders. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd		apiculture, conservation management, ecosystem service, land cover, land use change, policy approach, stakeholder, traditional knowledge, Costa Rica, Tectona grandis	2017-12-01
A real-time PCR method for quantification of the total and major variant strains of the deformed wing virus	European honey bees (Apis mellifera) are critically important to global food production by virtue of their pollination services but are severely threatened by deformed wing virus (DWV) especially in the presence of the external parasite Varroa destructor. DWV exists as many viral strains with the two major variants (DWV-A and DWV-B) varying in virulence. A single plasmid standard was constructed containing three sections for the specific determination of DWV-A (VP2 capsid region), DWV-B (IRES) and a conserved region suitable for total DWV (helicase region). The assays were confirmed as specific and discriminatory with limits of detections of 25, 25 and 50 genome equivalents for DWV-A, DWV-B and total-DWV, respectively. The methods were successfully tested on Apis mellifera and V. destructor samples with varying DWV profiles. The new method determined a more accurate total DWV titre in samples with substantial DWV-B than the method currently described in the COLOSS Beebook. The proposed assays could be utilized for the screening of large quantities of bee material for both a total DWV load overview along with more detailed investigations into DWV-A and DWV-B profiles. © 2017 Bradford et al.

Field-relevant doses of the systemic insecticide fipronil and fungicide pyraclostrobin impair mandibular and hypopharyngeal glands in nurse honeybees (Apis mellifera)	Global decreases in bee populations emphasize the importance of assessing how environmental stressors affect colony maintenance, especially considering the extreme task specialization observed in honeybee societies. Royal jelly, a protein secretion essential to colony nutrition, is produced by nurse honeybees, and development of bee mandibular glands, which comprise a reservoir surrounded by secretory cells and hypopharyngeal glands that are shaped by acini, is directly associated with production of this secretion. Here, we examined individual and combined effects of the systemic fungicide pyraclostrobin and insecticide fipronil in field-relevant doses (850 and 2.5 ppb, respectively) on mandibular and hypopharyngeal glands in nurse honeybees. Six days of pesticide treatment decreased secretory cell height in mandibular glands. When pyraclostrobin and fipronil were combined, the reservoir volume in mandibular glands also decreased. The total number of acini in hypopharyngeal glands was not affected, but pesticide treatment reduced the number of larger acini while increasing smaller acini. These morphological impairments appeared to reduce royal jelly secretion by nurse honeybees and consequently hampered colony maintenance. Overall, pesticide exposure in doses close to those experienced by bees in the field impaired brood-food glands in nurse honeybees, a change that could negatively influence development, survival, and colony maintenance. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-12-01
Do managed bees have negative effects on wild bees?: A systematic review of the literature	Managed bees are critical for crop pollination worldwide. As the demand for pollinator-dependent crops increases, so does the use of managed bees. Concern has arisen that managed bees may have unintended negative impacts on native wild bees, which are important pollinators in both agricultural and natural ecosystems. The goal of this study was to synthesize the literature documenting the effects of managed honey bees and bumble bees on wild bees in three areas: (1) competition for floral and nesting resources, (2) indirect effects via changes in plant communities, including the spread of exotic plants and decline of native plants, and (3) transmission of pathogens. The majority of reviewed studies reported negative effects of managed bees, but trends differed across topical areas. Of studies examining competition, results were highly variable with 53% reporting negative effects on wild bees, while 28% reported no effects and 19% reported mixed effects (varying with the bee species or variables examined). Equal numbers of studies examining plant communities reported positive (36%) and negative (36%) effects, with the remainder reporting no or mixed effects. Finally, the majority of studies on pathogen transmission (70%) reported potential negative effects of managed bees on wild bees. However, most studies across all topical areas documented the potential for impact (e.g. reporting the occurrence of competition or pathogens), but did not measure direct effects on wild bee fitness, abundance, or diversity. Furthermore, we found that results varied depending on whether managed bees were in their native or non-native range; managed bees within their native range had lesser competitive effects, but potentially greater effects on wild bees via pathogen transmission. We conclude that while this field has expanded considerably in recent decades, additional research measuring direct, long-term, and population-level effects of managed bees is needed to understand their potential impact on wild bees. © 2017 Mallinger et al.

Nosema ceranae, Fipronil and their combination compromise honey bee reproduction via changes in male physiology	The honey bee is threatened by biological agents and pesticides that can act in combination to induce synergistic effects on its physiology and lifespan. The synergistic effects of a parasite/pesticide combination have been demonstrated on workers and queens, but no studies have been performed on drones despite their essential contribution to colony sustainability by providing semen diversity and quality. The effects of the Nosema ceranae/fipronil combination on the life traits and physiology of mature drones were examined following exposure under semi-field conditions. The results showed that the microsporidia alone induced moderate and localized effects in the midgut, whereas fipronil alone induced moderate and generalized effects. The parasite/insecticide combination drastically affected both physiology and survival, exhibiting an important and significant generalized action that could jeopardize mating success. In terms of fertility, semen was strongly impacted regardless of stressor, suggesting that drone reproductive functions are very sensitive to stress factors. These findings suggest that drone health and fertility impairment might contribute to poorly mated queens, leading to the storage of poor quality semen and poor spermathecae diversity. Thus, the queens failures observed in recent years might result from the continuous exposure of drones to multiple environmental stressors. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-12-01
The heat shock response and humoral immune response are mutually antagonistic in honey bees	The honey bee is of paramount importance to humans in both agricultural and ecological settings. Honey bee colonies have suffered from increased attrition in recent years, stemming from complex interacting stresses. Defining common cellular stress responses elicited by these stressors represents a key step in understanding potential synergies. The proteostasis network is a highly conserved network of cellular stress responses involved in maintaining the homeostasis of protein production and function. Here, we have characterized the Heat Shock Response (HSR), one branch of this network, and found that its core components are conserved. In addition, exposing bees to elevated temperatures normally encountered by honey bees during typical activities results in robust HSR induction with increased expression of specific heat shock proteins that was variable across tissues. Surprisingly, we found that heat shock represses multiple immune genes in the abdomen and additionally showed that wounding the cuticle of the abdomen results in decreased expression of multiple HSR genes in proximal and distal tissues. This mutually antagonistic relationship between the HSR and immune activation is unique among invertebrates studied to date and may promote understanding of potential synergistic effects of disparate stresses in this critical pollinator and social insects more broadly. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-12-01
Protein nutrition governs within-host race of honey bee pathogens	Multiple infections are common in honey bees, Apis mellifera, but the possible role of nutrition in this regard is poorly understood. Microsporidian infections, which are promoted by protein-fed, can negatively correlate with virus infections, but the role of protein nutrition for the microsporidian-virus interface is unknown. Here, we challenged naturally deformed wing virus - B (DWV-B) infected adult honey bee workers fed with or without pollen (= protein) in hoarding cages, with the microsporidian Nosema ceranae. Bee mortality was recorded for 14 days and N. ceranae spore loads and DWV-B titers were quantified. Amongst the groups inoculated with N. ceranae, more spores were counted in protein-fed bees. However, N. ceranae infected bees without protein-diet had reduced longevity compared to all other groups. N. ceranae infection had no effect on protein-fed bee's longevity, whereas bees supplied only with sugar-water showed reduced survival. Our data also support that protein-feeding can have a significant negative impact on virus infections in insects. The negative correlation between N. ceranae spore loads and DWV-B titers was stronger expressed in protein-fed hosts. Proteins not only enhance survival of infected hosts, but also significantly shape the microsporidian-virus interface, probably due to increased spore production and enhanced host immunity. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-12-01
Bees of Maine, with a State Species Checklist	We present a new county checklist developed from bee research in Maine since the 1800s. The list contains 278 bee species in 37 genera and 6 families, of which all but 8 are native, with ≥50 taxa each in Andrena and Lasioglossum. Data for 16 counties from publications, museum collections, and recent surveys varied in number of species from 8 (Androscoggin) to 197 (Hancock). Research since 1930 on Vaccinium angustifolium (Lowbush Blueberry) led to many records. Twenty-one species are considered unusual, including 3 first recorded in 2016: Epeoloides pilosulus, Melitta melittoides, and Holcopasites calliopsidis. Maine records provide evidence of declines in Bombus affinis, decline in B. terricola followed by partial recovery, and increase in B. impatiens. Crops that should be studied regarding associated bees are Malus pumila (Apple), Vaccinium corymbosum (Highbush Blueberry), Vaccinium macrocarpon (American Cranberry), and Curcurbitaceae (cucurbits). Montane, sandy, and island habitats were identified as priorities for future sampling. We discuss records of bee species from New England relevant to understanding the Maine fauna, bee diversity, changes in abundance, cleptoparasitism, pesticide impacts, habitat requirements, and climate change.			2017-12-01
Landscape predictors of pathogen prevalence and range contractions in US bumblebees	Several species of bumblebees have recently experienced range contractions and possible extinctions. While threats to bees are numerous, few analyses have attempted to understand the relative importance of multiple stressors. Such analyses are critical for prioritizing conservation strategies. Here, we describe a landscape analysis of factors predicted to cause bumblebee declines in the USA. We quantified 24 habitat, land-use and pesticide usage variables across 284 sampling locations, assessing which variables predicted pathogen prevalence and range contractions via machine learning model selection techniques. We found that greater usage of the fungicide chlorothalonil was the best predictor of pathogen (Nosema bombi) prevalence in four declining species of bumblebees. Nosema bombi has previously been found in greater prevalence in some declining US bumblebee species compared to stable species. Greater usage of total fungicides was the strongest predictor of range contractions in declining species, with bumblebees in the northern USA experiencing greater likelihood of loss from previously occupied areas. These results extend several recent laboratory and semifield studies that have found surprising links between fungicide exposure and bee health. Specifically, our data suggest landscape-scale connections between fungicide usage, pathogen prevalence and declines of threatened and endangered bumblebees. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Monitoring colony-level effects of sublethal pesticide exposure on honey bees	The effects of sublethal pesticide exposure to honey bee colonies may be significant but difficult to detect in the field using standard visual assessment methods. Here we describe methods to measure the quantities of adult bees, brood, and food resources by weighing hives and hive parts, by photographing frames, and by installing hives on scales and with internal sensors. Data from these periodic evaluations are then combined with running average and daily detrended data on hive weight and internal hive temperature. The resulting datasets have been used to detect colony-level effects of imidacloprid applied in a sugar syrup as low as 5 parts per billion. The methods are objective, require little training, and provide permanent records in the form of sensor output and photographs. © 2017, Journal of Visualized Experiments.

Diagnosis and distribution of the Apis mellifera filamentous virus (AmFV) in honey bees (Apis mellifera) in China	Pre-screening of samples detected the presence of Apis mellifera filamentous virus (AmFV), a DNA virus that was previously confirmed to be in Apis cerana cerana colonies in several provinces in China. To study whether it was presence and prevalence in A. mellifera colony in China, we collected samples from 170 colonies across 17 provinces and to assess the occurrence and geographical distribution of AmFV in different regions. The highest prevalence occurred in Beijing (80%) among all positive provinces, and the lowest infection prevalence occurred in Fujian and Qinghai with 10%. There was significantly geographical distribution of AmFV infection among investigated regions, and north of China was significantly higher than south of China (p < 0.05) and central of China (p < 0.05). The low infection rate for AmFV was in south of China, southwest and central of China, suggesting that geographical characterization that might favor the presence of AmFV. Although the significance of AmFV infection is not fully understood, its presence may be one of the critical factors affecting honey bee health in China. © 2017, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).		disease prevalence, geographical distribution, honeybee, infectious disease, virus, China, Apis cerana cerana, Apis mellifera, DNA viruses	2017-11-01
Dietary amino acid and vitamin complex protects honey bee from immunosuppression caused by Nosema ceranae	Microsporidium Nosema ceranae is well known for exerting a negative impact on honey bee health, including down-regulation of immunoregulatory genes. Protein nutrition has been proven to have beneficial effects on bee immunity and other aspects of bee health. Bearing this in mind, the aim of our study was to evaluate the potential of a dietary amino acid and vitamin complex “BEEWELL AminoPlus” to protect honey bees from immunosuppression induced by N. ceranae. In a laboratory experiment bees were infected with N. ceranae and treated with supplement on first, third, sixth and ninth day after emergence. The expression of genes for immune-related peptides (abaecin, apidaecin, hymenoptaecin, defensin and vitellogenin) was compared between groups. The results revealed significantly lower (p<0.01 or p<0.001) numbers of Nosema spores in supplemented groups than in the control especially on day 12 post infection. With the exception of abacein, the expression levels of immune-related peptides were significantly suppressed (p<0.01 or p<0.001) in control group on the 12th day post infection, compared to bees that received the supplement. It was supposed that N. ceranae had a negative impact on bee immunity and that the tested amino acid and vitamin complex modified the expression of immune-related genes in honey bees compromised by infection, suggesting immune-stimulation that reflects in the increase in resistance to diseases and reduced bee mortality. The supplement exerted best efficacy when applied simultaneously with Nosema infection, which can help us to assume the most suitable period for its application in the hive. © 2017 Glavinic et al.

Chemical and cultural control of Tropilaelaps mercedesae mites in honeybee (Apis mellifera) colonies in Northern Thailand	At least two parasitic mites have moved from Asian species of honeybees to infest Apis mellifera. Of these two, Varroa destructor is more widespread globally while Tropilaelaps mercedesae has remained largely in Asia. Tropilaelaps mites are most problematic when A. mellifera is managed outside its native range in contact with Asian species of Apis. In areas where this occurs, beekeepers of A. mellifera treat aggressively for Tropilaelaps and Varroa is either outcompeted or is controlled as a result of the aggressive treatment regime used against Tropilaelaps. Many mite control products used worldwide may in fact control both mites but environmental conditions differ globally and thus a control product that works well in one area may be less or ineffective in other areas. This is especially true of volatile compounds. In the current research we tested several commercial products known to control Varroa and powdered sulfur for efficacy against Tropilaelaps. Additionally, we tested the cultural control method of making a hive division to reduce Tropilaelaps growth in both the parent and offspring colony. Making a split or nucleus colony significantly reduced mite population in both the parent and nucleus colony when compared to un-manipulated control colonies. The formic acid product, Mite-Away Quick Strips®, was the only commercial product that significantly reduced mite population 8 weeks after initiation of treatment without side effects. Sulfur also reduced mite populations but both sulfur and Hopguard® significantly impacted colony growth by reducing adult bee populations. Apivar® (amitraz) strips had no effect on mite or adult bee populations under the conditions tested. © 2017, Public Library of Science. All rights reserved.

Toward functional pollinator abundance and diversity: Comparing policy response for neonicotinoid use to demonstrate a need for cautious and well-planned policy	Functional pollinator abundance and diversity reflects global ecosystem health. Declines imply consequences for ecosystems, food production and human health. While broader objectives away from monoculture conventional agriculture is not addressed smaller scale approaches for land management require analysis to improve pollinator conservation outcomes. Policy response to neonicotinoid use can provide valuable lessons for developing well-informed, cautious and planned policy that encourages pollinator abundance and diversity. Response is inconsistent around the world with harm considered scientifically inconclusive by companies, governments and policy makers, and varied responses reflecting this position. Bans demonstrate how strong precautionary policy can assist pollination conservation despite a multitude of contrasting stakeholder opinions. Approach to implementation of such bans influences longevity and influence on conservation. This article presents findings from analysis of policy response by country to neonicotinoid use and suggests that variation in response be attributed to three non-exclusive areas; translation of research findings – influencing how inconclusive research findings could increase motivation for strong precaution, vested interest and approach to implementation. Scholarly articles and research findings clarifying information available to inform policy decisions are summarised through literature review, organised by key theme of article and additionally-mentioned themes. Meta-analysis of the scholarly articles provides statistical representation of mention rates indicative of how pollinator research is considering multiple stressors, associated or concurrent as contributing to declines. The policy process for neonicotinoid use is suggested as a space for learning where other conservation approaches, including introducing new species becomes relevant for policy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd		abundance, conservation planning, decision analysis, ecosystem function, ecosystem health, environmental policy, neonicotinoid pesticide, pollinator, species diversity, stakeholder	2017-11-01
The discovery of halictivirus resolves the sinaivirus phylogeny	By providing pollination services, bees are among the most important insects, both in ecological and economical terms. Combined next-generation and classical sequencing approaches were applied to discover and study new insect viruses potentially harmful to bees. A bioinformatics virus discovery pipeline was used on individual Illumina transcriptomes of 13 wild bees from three species from the genus Halictus and 30 ants from six species of the genera Messor and Aphaenogaster. This allowed the discovery and description of three sequences of a new virus termed Halictus scabiosae Adlikon virus (HsAV). Phylogenetic analyses of ORF1, RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) and capsid genes showed that HsAV is closely related to (+)ssRNA viruses of the unassigned Sinaivirus genus but distant enough to belong to a different new genus we called Halictivirus. In addition, our study of ant transcriptomes revealed the first four sinaivirus sequences from ants (Messor barbarus, M. capitatus and M. concolor). Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses were performed on a 594 nt fragment of the ORF1/RdRp region from 84 sinaivirus sequences, including 31 new Lake Sinai viruses (LSVs) from honey bees collected in five countries across the globe and the four ant viral sequences. The phylogeny revealed four main clades potentially representing different viral species infecting honey bees. Moreover, the ant viruses belonged to the LSV4 clade, suggesting a possible cross-species transmission between bees and ants. Lastly, wide honey bee screening showed that all four LSV clades have worldwide distributions with no obvious geographical segregation. © 2017 The Authors.

Acute toxicity of five pesticides to Apis mellifera larvae reared in vitro	BACKGROUND: The reported high loss rates of managed honey bee colonies have been attributed to diverse stressors including pesticides. Honey bee larvae can be exposed to pesticides in contaminated nectar, pollen and wax. Due to the difficulties of rearing larvae in vitro, research focusing on adult bee exposure to pesticides is more common than that on larva exposure to pesticides. Herein, we aimed to assess the acute toxicity of five insecticides to honey bee larvae using an improved in vitro rearing method. RESULTS: LC50 and LD50 were calculated for larvae at 72 h following a single diet exposure administered when the larvae were 84 ± 12 h old. Solvent control larval mortalities were less than 15% at 72 h. The LC50 values (mg L−1) for each tested pesticide were as follows: amitraz, 494.27; chlorpyrifos, 15.39; coumaphos, 90.01; fluvalinate, 27.69; and imidacloprid, 138.84. The LD50 values in µg per larva were 14.83 (amitraz), 0.46 (chlorpyrifos), 2.70 (coumaphos), 0.83 (fluvalinate) and 4.17 (imidacloprid). CONCLUSION: The toxicity of the test pesticides to honey bee larvae from most to least toxic was chlorpyrifos > fluvalinate > coumaphos = imidacloprid > amitraz. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry		adult, bioassay, colony, diet, honeybee, larva, mortality, pesticide application, pollution exposure, rearing, toxicity, toxicity test, Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2017-11-01
ABC assay: Method development and application to quantify the role of three DWV master variants in overwinter colony losses of European honey bees	Deformed wing virus (DWV) is one of the most prevalent honey bee viral pathogens in the world. Typical of many RNA viruses, DWV is a quasi-species, which is comprised of a large number of different variants, currently consisting of three master variants: Type A, B, and C. Little is known about the impact of each variant or combinations of variants upon the biology of individual hosts. Therefore, we have developed a new set of master variant-specific DWV primers and a set of standards that allow for the quantification of each of the master variants. Competitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experimental design confirms that each new DWV primer set is specific to the retrospective master variant. The sensitivity of the ABC assay is dependent on whether DNA or RNA is used as the template and whether other master variants are present in the sample. Comparison of the overall proportions of each master variant within a sample of known diversity, as confirmed by next-generation sequence (NGS) data, validates the efficiency of the ABC assay. The ABC assay was used on archived material from a Devon overwintering colony loss (OCL) 2006–2007 study; further implicating DWV type A and, for the first time, possibly C in the untimely collapse of honey bee colonies. Moreover, in this study DWV type B was not associated with OCL. The use of the ABC assay will allow researchers to quickly and cost effectively pre-screen for the presence of DWV master variants in honey bees. © 2017 by the authors.

Hemolectin expression reveals functional heterogeneity in honey bee (Apis mellifera) hemocytes	The identification of molecular markers considerably facilitated the classification and functional analysis of blood cell types. Apis mellifera hemocytes have been classified by morphological criteria and lectin binding properties; however, the use of molecular markers has been minimal. Here we describe a monoclonal antibody to a non-phagocytic subpopulation of A. mellifera hemocytes and to a constituent of the hemolymph clot. We demonstrate that the antibody identifies the A. mellifera hemolectin, a protein carrying human von Willebrand factor homology domains, characteristic of proteins involved in blood coagulation and platelet aggregation in mammals. Hemolectin expressing A. mellifera hemocytes contain the protein as cytoplasmic granules and contribute to the formation of a protein matrix, building up around foreign particles. Consequently, hemolectin as a marker molecule reveals a clear functional heterogeneity of hemocytes, allowing for the analytical separation of hemocyte classes, and could promote the molecular identification of hemocyte lineages in A. mellifera. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd		hemolectin, monoclonal antibody, unclassified drug, von Willebrand factor, lectin, transcriptome, von Willebrand factor, animal cell, Article, blood cell, blood clotting, cell granule, cell lineage, cell separation, controlled study, hemolymph, honeybee, mammal, nonhuman, priority journal, protein analysis, protein domain, protein expression, protein function, protein synthesis, thrombocyte aggregation, animal, bee, biodiversity, blood cell, genetics, immunology, isolation and purification, metabolism, phagocytosis, physiology, sequence homology, thrombosis, Animals, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Bees, Biodiversity, Cell Separation, Hemocytes, Hemolymph, Lectins, Mammals, Phagocytosis, Platelet Aggregation, Sequence Homology, Amino Acid, Thrombosis, Transcriptome, von Willebrand Factor	2017-11-01
Review of IoT applications in agro-industrial and environmental fields	This paper reviews agro-industrial and environmental applications that are using Internet of Things (IoT). It is motivated by the need to identify application areas, trends, architectures and open challenges in these two fields. The underlying survey was developed following a systematic literature review using academic documents written in English and published in peer-reviewed venues from 2006 to 2016. Selected references were clustered into four application domains corresponding to: monitoring, control, logistics, and prediction. Implementation-specific details from each selected reference were compiled to create usage distributions of sensors, actuators, power sources, edge computing modules, communication technologies, storage solutions, and visualization strategies. Finally, the results from the review were compiled into an IoT architecture that represents a wide range of current solutions in agro-industrial and environmental fields. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Thiamethoxam and picoxystrobin reduce the survival and overload the hepato-nephrocitic system of the Africanized honeybee	Apis mellifera perform important pollination roles in agroecosystems. However, there is often intensive use of systemic pesticides in crops, which can be carried to the colony by forage bees through the collection of contaminated pollen and nectar. Inside the colony, pollen loads are stored by bees that add honey and several enzymes to this pollen. Nevertheless, intra-colonial chronic exposure could induce sublethal effects in young bees exposed to a wide range of pesticides present in these pollen loads. This study was aimed to both determine the survival rate and evaluate the sublethal effects on the hepato-nephrocitic system in response to continuous oral exposure to lower concentrations of neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (TXT) and picoxystrobin fungicide (PXT). Exposure to a single chemical and co-exposure to both pesticides were performed in newly emerged honeybee workers. A significant decrease in the bee survival rates was observed following exposure to TXT (0.001 ng a.i./μL) and PXT (0.018 ng a.i./μL), as well as following co-exposure to TXT+PXT/2. After five days of continuous exposure, TXT induced sub-lethal effects in the organs involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics, such as the fat body and pericardial cells, and it also induced a significant increase in the hemocyte number. Thus, the hepato-nephrocitic system (HNS) reached the greatest level of activity of pericardial cells as an attempt to eliminate this toxic compound from hemolymph. The HNS was activated at low levels by PXT without an increase in the hemocyte number; however, the mobilization of neutral glycoconjugates from the trophocytes of the fat body was prominent only in this group. TXT and PXT co-exposure induced intermediary morphological effects in trophocytes and pericardial cells, but oenocytes from the fat body presented with atypical cytoplasm granulation only in this group. These data showed that the realistic concentrations of these pesticides are harmful to newly emerged Africanized honeybees, indicating that intra-colonial chronic exposure drastically reduces the longevity of bees exposed to neonicotinoid insecticide (TXT) and the fungicide strobilurin (PXT) as in single and co-exposure. Additionally, the sublethal effects observed in the organs constituting the HNS suggest that the activation of this system, even during exposure to low concentrations of theses pesticides, is an attempt to maintain homeostasis of the bees. These data together are alarming because these pesticides can affect the performance of the entire colony. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd		neonicotinoid, nitro derivative, oxazine derivative, pesticide, picoxystrobin, strobilurin, thiamethoxam, thiazole derivative, animal, bee, body fat, chemistry, crop, cytology, digestive system, drug effects, hemolymph, longevity, pericardium, pollen, Animals, Bees, Crops, Agricultural, Digestive System, Fat Body, Hemolymph, Longevity, Neonicotinoids, Nitro Compounds, Oxazines, Pericardium, Pesticides, Pollen, Strobilurins, Thiazoles	2017-11-01
Varroa sensitive hygiene contributes to naturally selected varroa resistance in honey bees	The parasitic mite Varroa destructor is a serious threat for western honey bee colonies and beekeepers are compelled to control it to keep their colonies healthy. Yet, by controlling varroa no resistance to the parasite can evolve. As a trial, honey bee colonies have been left untreated in isolated locations to allow development of resistance or tolerance to the mite. These colonies developed an ability to live without control measures against varroa, although the traits responsible for this resistance or tolerance are still unclear. Two of these resistant populations have been studied to test the involvement of specific varroa mite targeted hygienic behaviour varroa sensitive hygiene (VSH) in the acquired resistance. Individual mites were manually introduced into just capped brood cells, after which the brood combs were placed in colonies of the two resistant populations and in control colonies in which varroa had always been controlled. We followed the development of the mites, including possible removals. We found that VSH had increased strongly in one of the selections, up to 40% of the infested cells with mites and pupae were removed, but it had decreased in the other selection, compared to the control colonies. Further we could not conclude from our data that VSH only or preferentially targets reproducing mites, leaving non-reproducing mites undisturbed. The different VSH responses between the two selected resistant honey bee populations lead to conclude that more than one mechanism of resistance may evolve in response to the selection pressure by varroa mites. © 2017 The Author(s).

Agricultural pesticide residues in honey and wax combs from Southeastern, Central and Northeastern Mexico	Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) play an important ecological and economical role. Recently, Europe and the US have reported an increase in honey bee colony losses owing to several factors. Several possible causes for colony losses have been proposed, including exposure to pesticides such as agrochemicals for crop protection and pesticides for veterinarian use inside the hive. Mexico lacks reports about pesticide residues in hive products (honey, beeswax, pollen, propolis and royal jelly). This study presents the analysis of 93 agricultural pesticide residues found in honey and beeswax samples from Yucatan, the main area of beekeeping in Mexico, and from hives in Northeastern and Central Mexico, as well as in commercial wax samples. The number and concentrations of pesticides found are dependent of region. Yucatan hive samples had the lowest levels of agrochemicals. In Yucatan, the main agrochemical found in honey was the fungicide phenylphenol, while in wax combs, the agrochemicals found in the highest concentrations were the phenylphenol and the organochlorine 2,4′-DDT. In Northeastern Mexico, the main pesticides detected in wax and/or honey were malathion, chlorpyrifos, phenylphenol and thiabendazole, whereas in Central Mexico, the most common residues were chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid. Commercial wax showed low levels of pesticides residues. Malathion concentration in one sample of honey taken from Northeastern Mexico exceeded the European Maximum Residue Levels (MRL = 0.05 mg/kg). © 2017 International Bee Research Association.			2017-10-20
The composition of bee pollen color fractions evaluated by solid-state<sup>1</sup>H and<sup>13</sup>C NMR: their macroelement content and antioxidant properties	Honey bee pollen is a good source of nourishing substances with a wide range of potential therapeutic properties. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the composition and antioxidant activities of bee pollens collected from commercial hives in Poland. Plant sources were buckwheat and rapeseed. The pollen loads differed in color, so samples were separated into color fractions. The highest content of minerals (K, Ca, P) was in samples from: buckwheat (S1) and rapeseed (S7). The rapeseed pollen had significantly higher amounts of polyphenols and flavonoids, and higher values of antioxidant capacities as measured by DPPH, FRAP and ORAC assays. 13C CPMAS NMR spectra revealed the presence of carbohydrates (including polymers), lipids, polyphenols and amino acids. Solid-state 1H MAS spectra showed the resonances of lipids, sugars and different amounts of water. Our results indicate that 1H and 13C MAS NMR spectroscopy can be very useful to characterize bee pollen types. © 2017 International Bee Research Association.			2017-10-20
Oral administration of essential oils and main components: Study on honey bee survival and Nosema ceranae development	Diverse parasites and pathogens affect productivity and survival of honey bees. Plant secondary metabolites are potential alternative treatments, however, their effect has been little studied on microsporidian diseases. Furthermore, there is poor information about the toxicity resulting from prolonged oral administration of these substances to bees. In this research, we evaluated in vivo effects of different essential oils and main components (MCs) on bee survival and Nosema ceranae development under an ad libitum non-choice regimen. Substances administered on sucrose syrup to newly emerged bees at different concentrations were avidly consumed and caused different survival performances. Nevertheless, sublethal doses of substances did not control the parasite. © 2017 International Bee Research Association.			2017-10-20
Empirical, metagenomic, and computational techniques illuminate the mechanisms by which fungicides compromise bee health	Growers often use fungicide sprays during bloom to protect crops against disease, which exposes bees to fungicide residues. Although considered “bee-safe,” there is mounting evidence that fungicide residues in pollen are associated with bee declines (for both honey and bumble bee species). While the mechanisms remain relatively unknown, researchers have speculated that bee-microbe symbioses are involved. Microbes play a pivotal role in the preservation and/or processing of pollen, which serves as nutrition for larval bees. By altering the microbial community, it is likely that fungicides disrupt these microbe-mediated services, and thereby compromise bee health. This manuscript describes the protocols used to investigate the indirect mechanism(s) by which fungicides may be causing colony decline. Cage experiments exposing bees to fungicide-treated flowers have already provided the first evidence that fungicides cause profound colony losses in a native bumble bee (Bombus impatiens). Using field-relevant doses of fungicides, a series of experiments have been developed to provide a finer description of microbial community dynamics of fungicide-exposed pollen. Shifts in the structural composition of fungal and bacterial assemblages within the pollen microbiome are investigated by next-generation sequencing and metagenomic analysis. Experiments developed herein have been designed to provide a mechanistic understanding of how fungicides affect the microbiome of pollen-provisions. Ultimately, these findings should shed light on the indirect pathway through which fungicides may be causing colony declines. © 2017 Journal of Visualized Experiments.		fungicide, animal, bee, metagenomics, microflora, physiology, pollen, procedures, yeast, Animals, Bees, Fungicides, Industrial, Metagenomics, Microbiota, Pollen, Yeasts	2017-10-09
Metabolism of N-Methyl-2-Pyrrolidone in Honey Bee Adults and Larvae: Exploring Age Related Differences in Toxic Effects	In chronic feeding assays, the common agrochemical inert formulant N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) is at least 20 times more toxic to honey bee larvae than to adults, but the underlying cause of this difference is unknown. In other taxa, NMP is primarily detoxified via a cytochrome P450 mediated pathway. Using a LC-MS method, putative cytochrome P450 metabolites of NMP were identified and quantified in adults and larvae following chronic exposure to NMP. Major differences in the identities and quantities of the generated metabolites were observed between adults and larvae. One major difference was the higher percentage of the administered NMP recovered as the parent compound in larvae compared to adults. To further explore the apparent difference in metabolic capacity, a spectrofluorometric method was used to compare general cytochrome P450 enzyme activity by monitoring the transformation of a 7-ethoxycoumarin substrate. Higher microsomal levels of 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase activity in adult fat bodies suggests that the higher percentage of unmetabolized NMP in larvae relative to adults may be due to lower cytochrome P450 enzyme activity in fat bodies. Taken together, these results suggest that larvae may be less able to detoxify xenobiotics encountered in diet than adults, and these findings will help inform future risk assessment. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

Quantitative weight of evidence assessment of higher-tier studies on the toxicity and risks of neonicotinoid insecticides in honeybees 1: Methods	A quantitative weight of evidence (QWoE) methodology was developed and used to assess many higher-tier studies on the effects of three neonicotinoid insecticides: clothianidin (CTD), imidacloprid (IMI), and thiamethoxam (TMX) on honeybees. A general problem formulation, a conceptual model for exposures of honeybees, and an analysis plan were developed. A QWoE methodology was used to characterize the quality of the available studies from the literature and unpublished reports of studies conducted by or for the registrants. These higher-tier studies focused on the exposures of honeybees to neonicotinoids via several matrices as measured in the field as well as the effects in experimentally controlled field studies. Reports provided by Bayer Crop Protection and Syngenta Crop Protection and papers from the open literature were assessed in detail, using predefined criteria for quality and relevance to develop scores (on a relative scale of 0–4) to separate the higher-quality from lower-quality studies and those relevant from less-relevant results. The scores from the QWoEs were summarized graphically to illustrate the overall quality of the studies and their relevance. Through mean and standard errors, this method provided graphical and numerical indications of the quality and relevance of the responses observed in the studies and the uncertainty associated with these two metrics. All analyses were conducted transparently and the derivations of the scores were fully documented. The results of these analyses are presented in three companion papers and the QWoE analyses for each insecticide are presented in detailed supplemental information (SI) in these papers. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.		clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, guanidine derivative, imidacloprid, insecticide, neonicotinoid, nitro derivative, oxazine derivative, thiamethoxam, thiazole derivative, adverse outcome, Article, controlled study, crop protection, dust, field study, food, guttation, honeybee, nonhuman, quantitative analysis, soil, animal, bee, drug effects, environmental monitoring, methodology, risk assessment, toxicity testing, Animals, Bees, Environmental Monitoring, Guanidines, Insecticides, Neonicotinoids, Nitro Compounds, Oxazines, Research Design, Risk Assessment, Thiazoles, Toxicity Tests	2017-10-03
Quantitative weight of evidence assessment of higher-tier studies on the toxicity and risks of neonicotinoids in honeybees. 2. Imidacloprid	A quantitative weight of evidence (QWoE) methodology was used to assess higher-tier studies on the effects of imidacloprid (IMI) on honeybees. Assessment endpoints were population size and viability of commercially managed bees and quantity of hive products. A colony-level no-observed-adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of 25 µg IMI/kg syrup, equivalent to an oral no-observed-adverse-effect-dose of 7.3 ng/bee/d for all responses, was measured. The overall weight of evidence indicates that there is minimal risk to honeybees from exposure to IMI from its use as a seed treatment. Exposures via dusts from currently used seed coatings present a de minimis risk to honeybees when the route of exposure is via uptake in plants that are a source of pollen or nectar for honeybees. There were few higher-tier observational (ecoepidemiological) studies conducted with IMI. Considering all lines of evidence, the quality of the studies included in this analysis was variable, but the results of the studies were consistent and point to the same conclusion–that IMI had no adverse effects on viability of the honeybee colony. Thus, the overall conclusion is that IMI, as currently used as a seed treatment and with good agricultural practices, does not present a significant risk to honeybees at the level of the colony. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.		imidacloprid, neonicotinoid, surface water, clothianidin, guanidine derivative, imidacloprid, insecticide, neonicotinoid, nitro derivative, oxazine derivative, thiamethoxam, thiazole derivative, Article, chemical structure, exposure, honeybee, methodology, nectar, nonhuman, pollen, quantitative weight of evidence, risk assessment, risk factor, seed treatment, toxicity, toxicology, animal, bee, drug effects, environmental monitoring, risk assessment, toxicity testing, Animals, Bees, Environmental Monitoring, Guanidines, Insecticides, Neonicotinoids, Nitro Compounds, Oxazines, Risk Assessment, Thiazoles, Toxicity Tests	2017-10-03
Quantitative weight of evidence assessment of higher tier studies on the toxicity and risks of neonicotinoids in honeybees. 4. Thiamethoxam	A quantitative weight of evidence (QWoE) methodology was used to assess several higher-tier studies on the effects of thiamethoxam (TMX) on honeybees. Assessment endpoints were population size and viability of commercially managed honeybee colonies and quantity of hive products. A higher-tier field toxicology study indicated a no-observed-adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of 29.5 µg TMX/kg syrup, equivalent to an oral no-observed-adverse-effect-dose (NOAED) of 8.6 ng/bee/day for all responses measured. For exposures via deposition of dust, a conservative no-observed-adverse-effect-rate at the level of the colony was 0.1 g TMX/ha. There was minimal risk to honeybees from exposure to TMX via nectar and pollen from its use as a seed-treatment. For exposures via dust and dust/seed applications, there were no concentrations above the risk values for TMX in nectar and pollen. Although some risks were identified for potential exposures via guttation fluid, this route of exposure is incomplete; no apparent adverse effects were observed in field studies. For exposures via dust/seed and dust/foliar applications, few adverse effects were observed. Considering all lines of evidence, the quality of the studies included in this analysis was variable. However, the results of the studies were consistent and point to the same conclusion. The overall weight of evidence based on many studies indicates that TMX has no adverse effects on viability or survival of the colony. Thus, the overall conclusion is that the treatment of seeds with thiamethoxam, as currently used in good agricultural practices, does not present a significant risk to honeybees at the level of the colony. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.		neonicotinoid, surface water, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, guanidine derivative, imidacloprid, insecticide, neonicotinoid, nitro derivative, oxazine derivative, thiamethoxam, thiazole derivative, Article, comparative study, controlled study, dust, environmental exposure, guttation, honeybee, nectar, nonhuman, physical phenomena, pollen, risk factor, seed treatment, surface property, animal, bee, drug effects, environmental monitoring, risk assessment, toxicity testing, Animals, Bees, Environmental Monitoring, Guanidines, Insecticides, Neonicotinoids, Nitro Compounds, Oxazines, Risk Assessment, Thiazoles, Toxicity Tests	2017-10-03
Field Residues and Effects of the Insect Growth Regulator Novaluron and Its Major Co-Formulant N -Methyl-2-Pyrrolidone on Honey Bee Reproduction and Development	Owing to the recent declines in honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) populations, there is a need for field and laboratory studies to investigate threats to pollinator health. This study examines the hypothesis that the organophosphate alternative, Rimon 0.83EC, can have consequences to honey bee health by combining newly acquired field residue data, laboratory bioassays, and colony level feeding studies. Following label rate applications of Rimon 0.83EC to apple trees, average residue concentrations of the active ingredient, novaluron, were found to be 3.38 ppm in tree-collected pollen. Residues of the major co-formulant in Rimon 0.83EC, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), were below the limit of detection in the field, but a growth chamber study described here found that NMP can persist in pollen for up to 7 d with average concentrations of 69.3 ppm. Concurrent larval rearing studies found novaluron and NMP to be toxic to developing honey bees at doses as low as 100 ppb and 100 ppm, respectively. Nucleus colony feeding studies found that chronic exposure to Rimon 0.83EC at doses as low as 200 ppm (18.6 ppm novaluron) can result in interruptions to brood production that can last for up to 2 wk after exposure. Taken together, these data indicate the use of Rimon 0.83EC on blooming flowers is a significant threat to honey bee reproduction, and suggest the need for more strict and clear usage guidelines. © The Author 2017.

Amitraz and its metabolite modulate honey bee cardiac function and tolerance to viral infection	The health and survival of managed honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies are affected by multiple factors, one of the most important being the interaction between viral pathogens and infestations of the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor. Currently, the only effective strategy available for mitigating the impact of viral infections is the chemical control of mite populations. Unfortunately, the use of in-hive acaricides comes at a price, as they can produce sublethal effects that are difficult to quantify, but may ultimately be as damaging as the mites they are used to treat. The goal of this study was to investigate the physiological and immunological effects of the formamidine acaricide amitraz and its primary metabolite in honey bees. Using flock house virus as a model for viral infection, this study found that exposure to a formamidine acaricide may have a negative impact on the ability of honey bees to tolerate viral infection. Furthermore, this work has demonstrated that amitraz and its metabolite significantly alter honey bee cardiac function, most likely through interaction with octopamine receptors. The results suggest a potential drawback to the in-hive use of amitraz and raise intriguing questions about the relationship between insect cardiac function and disease tolerance. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.			2017-10-01
Effects of diluents and plasma on honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) drone frozen-thawed semen fertility	Cryopreservation is an advanced method used to protect germplasm in liquid nitrogen. Honey bees are of special interest to protect because of their pollination activity and critical role in agriculture. There has been important progress in the cryopreservation of honey bee germplasm in recent years, leading to practical recovery of genetic material for breeding purposes following freezing. However, there remains room for improvement and the goal of the present study was to evaluate the effect of different “extenders” added post-thaw on the fertilization rate of cryopreserved honey bee semen. The purpose of adding extender post-thaw was to dilute the cryoprotectant to remove chemicals after centrifugation because of potential adverse effects. The control consisted of frozen-thawed semen without the addition of an extender; treatment groups included the addition of one of the following extenders: glucose solution, fresh ram semen plasma, fresh honey bee semen plasma, extender solution. All of the above treatments and frozen-thawed control were compared to fresh semen. For each group, 15 virgin queens were instrumentally inseminated with the semen-diluent solution and introduced into nucleus colonies to determine the brood patterns of the queens. Percentages of worker brood produced in the fresh semen, frozen-thawed semen control, glucose, fresh ram semen plasma, fresh honey bee semen plasma, and extender solution supplemented groups were 98.±1.1%, 47.0 ± 0.9%, 3.0 ± 0.8%, 0.3 ± 0.1%, 48.1 ± 4.1% and 40.3 ± 2.4%, respectively. Similiarly, spermatozoa numbers in the spermathecae of the same treatment groups were 3.6 × 106, 1.6 × 106, 7.3 × 105, 4.7 × 105, 8.1 × 105, and 4.6 × 105 spermatozoa for the same treatment, respectively. The differences in both worker brood percentage and sperm count in the spermatheca were statistically significant (P < 0.01) among all treatment groups, except the frozen-thawed control group and fresh drone semen plasma group. We found a positive correlation between sperm count in the spermatheca and the percentage of worker brood (r = 0.91). With the exception of fresh honey bee semen plasma, the fertility rate was reduced following the addition of various plasmas and diluents post-freezing. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.			2017-10-01
Immune related gene expression in worker honey bee (Apis mellifera carnica) pupae exposed to neonicotinoid thiamethoxam and Varroa mites (Varroa destructor)	Varroa destructor is one of the most common parasites of honey bee colonies and is considered as a possible co-factor for honey bee decline. At the same time, the use of pesticides in intensive agriculture is still the most effective method of pest control. There is limited information about the effects of pesticide exposure on parasitized honey bees. Larval ingestion of certain pesticides could have effects on honey bee immune defense mechanisms, development and metabolic pathways. Europe and America face the disturbing phenomenon of the disappearance of honey bee colonies, termed Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). One reason discussed is the possible suppression of honey bee immune system as a consequence of prolonged exposure to chemicals. In this study, the effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on honey bee, Apis mellifera carnica, pupae infested with Varroa destructor mites were analyzed at the molecular level. Varroa-infested and non-infested honey bee colonies received protein cakes with or without thiamethoxam. Nurse bees used these cakes as a feed for developing larvae. Samples of white-eyed and brown-eyed pupae were collected. Expression of 17 immune-related genes was analyzed by real-time PCR. Relative gene expression in samples exposed only to Varroa or to thiamethoxam or simultaneously to both Varroa and thiamethoxam was compared. The impact from the consumption of thiamethoxam during the larval stage on honey bee immune related gene expression in Varroa-infested white-eyed pupae was reflected as down-regulation of spaetzle, AMPs abaecin and defensin-1 and up-regulation of lysozyme-2. In brown-eyed pupae up-regulation of PPOact, spaetzle, hopscotch and basket genes was detected. Moreover, we observed a major difference in immune response to Varroa infestation between white-eyed pupae and brown-eyed pupae. The majority of tested immune-related genes were upregulated only in brown-eyed pupae, while in white-eyed pupae they were downregulated. © 2017 Tesovnik et al.

Revealing Pesticide Residues under High Pesticide Stress in Taiwan's Agricultural Environment Probed by Fresh Honey Bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Pollen	Significant pesticide residues are among the most serious problems for sustainable agriculture. In the beekeeping environment, pesticides not only impact a honey bee's survival, but they also contaminate bee products. Taiwan's agricultural environment has suffered from pesticide stress that was higher than that found in Europe and America. This study deciphered problems of pesticide residues in fresh honey bee pollen samples collected from 14 monitoring apiaries in Taiwan, which reflected significant contaminations within the honey bee population. In total, 155 pollen samples were screened for 232 pesticides, and 56 pesticides were detected. Among the residues, fluvalinate and chlorpyrifos showed the highest concentrations, followed by carbendazim, carbaryl, chlorfenapyr, imidacloprid, ethion, and flufenoxuron. The average frequency of pesticide residues detected in pollen samples was ca. 74.8%. The amounts and types of pesticides were higher in winter and in southwestern Taiwan. Moreover, five of these pollen samples were contaminated with 11-15 pesticides, with average levels between 1,560 and 6,390 μg/kg. Compared with the literature, this study emphasized that pollen gathered by honey bee was highly contaminated with more pesticides in Taiwan than in the America, France, and Spain. The ubiquity of pesticides in the pollen samples was likely due to the field applications of common pesticides. Recently, the Taiwanese government began to improve the pesticide policy. According to the resurvey data in 2016, there were reductions in several pesticide contamination parameters in pollen samples from west to southwest Taiwan. A long-term investigation of pollen pesticide residues should be conducted to inspect pesticides usage in Taiwan's agriculture. © The Author 2017.

Neonicotinoid pesticides can reduce honeybee colony genetic diversity	Neonicotinoid insecticides can cause a variety of adverse sub-lethal effects in bees. In social species such as the honeybee, Apis mellifera, queens are essential for reproduction and colony functioning. Therefore, any negative effect of these agricultural chemicals on the mating success of queens may have serious consequences for the fitness of the entire colony. Queens were exposed to the common neonicotinoid pesticides thiamethoxam and clothianidin during their developmental stage. After mating, their spermathecae were dissected to count the number of stored spermatozoa. Furthermore, their worker offspring were genotyped with DNA microsatellites to determine the number of matings and the genotypic composition of the colony. Colonies providing the male mating partners were also inferred. Both neonicotinoid and control queens mated with drones originating from the same drone source colonies, and stored similar number of spermatozoa. However, queens reared in colonies exposed to both neonicotinoids experienced fewer matings. This resulted in a reduction of the genetic diversity in their colonies (i.e. higher intracolonial relatedness). As decreased genetic diversity among worker bees is known to negatively affect colony vitality, neonicotinoids may have a cryptic effect on colony health by reducing the mating frequency of queens. © 2017 Forfert et al.		clothianidin, DNA, thiamethoxam, nicotine, pesticide, Article, controlled study, drone, female, gene amplification, genetic variability, genotype, honeybee, male, mating, microsatellite marker, nonhuman, organism colony, queen (insect), spermatheca, worker (insect), animal, bee, drug effects, genetic variation, genetics, sexual behavior, Animals, Bees, Female, Genetic Variation, Male, Nicotine, Pesticides, Sexual Behavior, Animal	2017-10-01
Relative abundance of deformed wing virus, Varroa destructor virus 1, and their recombinants in honey bees (Apis mellifera) assessed by kmer analysis of public RNA-Seq data	Deformed wing virus (DWV) is a major pathogen of concern to apiculture, and recent reports have indicated the local predominance and potential virulence of recombinants between DWV and a related virus, Varroa destructor virus 1 (VDV). However, little is known about the frequency and titer of VDV and recombinants relative to DWV generally. In this study, I assessed the relative occurrence and titer of DWV and VDV in public RNA-seq accessions of honey bee using a rapid, kmer-based approach. Three recombinant types were detectable graphically and corroborated by de novo assembly. Recombination breakpoints did not disrupt the capsid-encoding region, consistent with previous reports, and both VDV- and DWV-derived capsids were observed in recombinant backgrounds. High abundance of VDV kmers was largely restricted to recombinant forms. Non-metric multidimensional scaling identified genotypic clusters among DWV isolates, which was corroborated by read mapping and consensus generation. The recently described DWV-C lineage was not detected in the searched accessions. The data further highlight the utility of high-throughput sequencing to monitor viral polymorphisms and statistically test biological predictors of titer, and point to the need for consistent methodologies and sampling schemes. © 2017			2017-10-01
Nectar and Pollen Phytochemicals Stimulate Honey Bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Immunity to Viral Infection	Parasites and pathogens are implicated in honey bee colony losses, and honey bees may also spread infection to wild pollinators. Bees consume nectar and pollen, which contain phytochemicals that can positively or negatively affect pollinator health. Certain phytochemicals can reduce parasite loads in humans and other animals. Understanding how phytochemicals affect honey bee infection and survival could help identify optimal forage sources and phytochemical treatments to ameliorate disease. We fed honey bees seven dietary phytochemicals to evaluate whether phytochemical consumption would treat preexisting infection in mature bees, or mitigate infection in young bees either inside or outside of their colonies. Phytochemicals were generally well-tolerated at levels documented in nectar, honey, and pollen, although clove oil and thymol increased mortality at high doses. Six of seven tested phytochemicals significantly increased antimicrobial peptide expression by 12.9 to 61-fold in older bees after 7 d consumption. Short-term (<24 h) phytochemical consumption reduced levels of Deformed wing virus (DWV) up to 500-fold in young bees released into field colonies. However, with the exception of high-dose clove oil, our phytochemical treatments did not alter infection with Lotmaria passim or Nosema ceranae. Phytochemicals also lacked antiviral effects for pollen-deprived bees reared outside the colony. Our results suggest that phytochemicals have potential therapeutic value for honey bees infected with DWV. Short-term phytochemical consumption may be sufficient to confer benefits against infection. Phytochemical concentrations that reduced disease were comparable with naturally occurring floral concentrations, suggesting that flowers could serve as seasonally varied, serially consumed pollinator medicines.

The silent beehive: How the decline of honey bee populations shifted the environmental protection agency's pesticide policy towards pollinators	When honey bee populations began to drastically decline in 2006 from what came to be known as Colony Collapse Disorder, the response from the United States Department of Agriculture was swift. As research emerged on the causes, pesticides-specifically a new and widely used class of pesticides called neonicotinoids-quickly emerged as an identifiable culprit. In reaction, the Environmental Protection Agency, as the administrator of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, began to develop a new, tiered ecological risk assessment framework to better analyze the risk that pesticides posed to honey bees and other insect pollinators. In 2012, the Environmental Protection Agency applied the new guidelines to the application for registration of a new type of neonicotinoid, sulfoxaflor. However, despite the analysis showing that sulfoxaflor posed high risks to honey bees, the Environmental Protection Agency approved the unconditional registration of sulfoxaflor. Pollinator advocates then successfully challenged the Environmental Protection Agency's registration of the neonicotinoid pesticide, sulfoxaflor in Pollinator Stewardship Council v. EPA. This was a victory for pollinator advocates who had been unsuccessful in challenging other pesticide registrations due to the lengthy administrative petition required. This Note argues that it was the combination of honey bees' critical importance in the agricultural industry and their prevalence in popular culture that drove the quick agency action that led to the Environmental Protection Agency's creation of the Pollinator Risk Assessment guidelines. These newguidelines included set standards that allowed pollinator advocates to successfully challenge a registration. However, even though the Pollinator Risk Assessment guidelines have resulted in the Environmental Protection Agency applying higher scrutiny to neonicotinoids, the ability of the new guidelines to significantly impact pesticide policy is and will continue to be limited, even while honey bees continue to garner attention in popular culture.

5 key challenges and solutions for governing complex adaptive (food) systems	There is increasing recognition in academic circles of the importance of adaptive governance for the sustainability of social-ecological systems, but little examination of specific implications for the 34% of land-use where human activities are pervasive but potentially commensurate with functioning ecosystems: agricultural production systems. In this paper, we argue for the need to view food systems and agro-ecosystems as multi-scalar complex adaptive systems and identify five key challenging characteristics of such systems: multi-causality; cumulative impacts; regime shifts; teleconnections and mismatch of scales. These characteristics are necessary features of multi-scalar adaptive systems, and apply equally to social and natural subsystems. We discuss the implications of these characteristics for agricultural production systems and consider how governance can rise to these challenges. We present five case studies that highlight these issues: pollinator declines; payments for ecosystem services; pest control and pesticide resistance; downstream aquatic systems in Tasman Bay, New Zealand; and riparian buffers in Puget Sound, USA. From these case studies we derive recommendations for managing agricultural systems, both specific and general. Ultimately, adaptive governance of agro-ecosystems will likely hinge upon three paradigm shifts: viewing farmers and ranchers not only as food producers but also as land and water managers; seeking not yield maximization but rather resilient management of food ecosystems; and critically, as it transcends the production-system literature, engaging broad audiences not only as consumers but also citizens. © 2017 by the authors.		adaptive management, agricultural ecosystem, agricultural production, agriculture, environmental legislation, food production, governance approach, human activity, land management, land use, paradigm shift, production system, sustainability, water management, New Zealand, Puget Sound, South Island, Tasman Bay, United States, Washington [United States]	2017-09-07
Honey bee-collected pollen in agro-ecosystems reveals diet diversity, diet quality, and pesticide exposure	European honey bees Apis mellifera are important commercial pollinators that have suffered greater than normal overwintering losses since 2007 in North America and Europe. Contributing factors likely include a combination of parasites, pesticides, and poor nutrition. We examined diet diversity, diet nutritional quality, and pesticides in honey bee-collected pollen from commercial colonies in the Canadian Maritime Provinces in spring and summer 2011. We sampled pollen collected by honey bees at colonies in four site types: apple orchards, blueberry fields, cranberry bogs, and fallow fields. Proportion of honey bee-collected pollen from crop versus noncrop flowers was high in apple, very low in blueberry, and low in cranberry sites. Pollen nutritional value tended to be relatively good from apple and cranberry sites and poor from blueberry and fallow sites. Floral surveys ranked, from highest to lowest in diversity, fallow, cranberry, apple, and blueberry sites. Pesticide diversity in honey bee-collected pollen was high from apple and blueberry sites and low from cranberry and fallow sites. Four different neonicotinoid pesticides were detected, but neither these nor any other pesticides were at or above LD50 levels. Pollen hazard quotients were highest in apple and blueberry sites and lowest in fallow sites. Pollen hazard quotients were also negatively correlated with the number of flower taxa detected in surveys. Results reveal differences among site types in diet diversity, diet quality, and pesticide exposure that are informative for improving honey bee and land agro-ecosystem management. © 2017 The Authors.

Dietary supplementation of honey bee larvae with arginine and abscisic acid enhances nitric oxide and granulocyte immune responses after trauma	Many biotic and abiotic stressors impact bees’ health, acting as immunosupressors and contribute to colony losses. Thus, the importance of studying the immune response of honey bees is central to develop new strategies aiming to enhance bees’ fitness to confront the threats affecting them. If a pathogen breaches the physical and chemical barriers, honey bees can protect themselves from infection with cellular and humoral immune responses which represent a second line of defense. Through a series of correlative studies we have previously reported that abscisic acid (ABA) and nitric oxide (NO) share roles in the same immune defenses of Apis mellifera (A. mellifera). Here we show results supporting that the supplementation of bee larvae’s diet reared in vitro with L-Arginine (precursor of NO) or ABA enhanced the immune activation of the granulocytes in response to wounding and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. © 2017 by the authors.			2017-09-01
Coumaphos residues in honey, bee brood, and beeswax after Varroa treatment	Residues of acaricide coumaphos were assessed in honey, bee brood, and beeswax during a 2-year field experiment. Honey, bee brood, and beeswax samples were collected before and after routine use of coumaphos in the treatment of bee colonies against varroosis in two consecutive years. Determination of coumaphos in honey and bee brood was based on RP-HPLC with UV detection after a liquid-liquid extraction with hexane or ethyl acetate. Coumaphos in beeswax was identified and quantified by GC/MS. Results indicate the undetectable presence of coumaphos in honey. In bee brood, coumaphos was observed after the treatment. In beeswax, the accumulation of coumaphos was determined not only in hives where it was used but also in hives nearby in which coumaphos was not used. Results indicate the accumulation of coumaphos in bee brood and beeswax. Due to the coumaphos accumulation this drug should be used only in strongly affected bee colonies. © 2017, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		acaricide, biochemistry, experimental study, honey, honeybee, identification method, liquid chromatography, pesticide residue, wax, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Varroa	2017-09-01
Internal hive temperature as a means of monitoring honey bee colony health in a migratory beekeeping operation before and during winter	Internal temperatures of honey bee hives kept at different sites in North Dakota were monitored before and during winter to evaluate the effects of treatment, in the form of exposure to commercial pollination, and location on colony health. In October, hives exposed to commercial pollination during the summer had fewer adult bees and less brood than hives kept near natural forage, as well as lower average temperatures throughout winter. Within-day temperature variability was higher among hives exposed to commercial agriculture than for those kept near natural forage, indicating reduced temperature control. Fungicides, insecticides, varroacides, and an herbicide were detected in bee bread and wax samples; no major differences were observed either in the diversity or in the concentrations of agrochemicals with the exception of chlorpyrifos at one site. Varroa and Nosema densities were low overall. Data from the same site used in successive years showed significantly more brood the first year, as well as lower temperature variability; high levels of chlorpyrifos were detected in bee bread of colonies in the second year. Colony average temperature and temperature variability were informative with respect to colony phenology and post-winter status. © 2017, The Author(s).		adult, agrochemical, amplitude, apiculture, biomonitoring, brood rearing, colony, concentration (composition), fungus, mite, parasite, pesticide residue, phenology, pollination, temperature, weight, North Dakota, United States, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Nosema, Varroa	2017-09-01
Toxicity of organophosphorus pesticides to the stingless bees Scaptotrigona bipunctata and Tetragonisca fiebrigi	This study estimated the toxicity of the insecticides chlorpyrifos and phosmet to the stingless bees Scaptotrigona bipunctata and Tetragonisca fiebrigi. The results showed significant differences in susceptibility between the tested species, indicating that S. bipunctata are more tolerant to chlorpyrifos than T. fiebrigi in both assays. In contrast, the two tested stingless bee species showed no significant differences in susceptibility to phosmet. Our findings indicated that the insecticides chlorpyrifos and phosmet are potentially dangerous to S. bipunctata and T. fiebrigi both topically and by ingestion. It is essential to propose measures to minimize the impact of these products on pollinators. This study is the first evaluation of the lethal effects of the insecticides chlorpyrifos and phosmet to S. bipunctata and T. fiebrigi, and it provides important support for future studies on pesticide toxicity in stingless bees. © 2017, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		bee, bioassay, chlorpyrifos, insecticide, organophosphorus pesticide, pollinator, toxicity, Meliponinae, Scaptotrigona bipunctata, Tetragonisca	2017-09-01
Ecological and evolutionary approaches to managing honeybee disease\	Honeybee declines are a serious threat to global agricultural security and productivity. Although multiple factors contribute to these declines, parasites are a key driver. Disease problems in honeybees have intensified in recent years, despite increasing attention to addressing them. Here we argue that we must focus on the principles of disease ecology and evolution to understand disease dynamics, assess the severity of disease threats, and control these threats via honeybee management. We cover the ecological context of honeybee disease, including both host and parasite factors driving current transmission dynamics, and then discuss evolutionary dynamics including how beekeeping management practices may drive selection for more virulent parasites. We then outline how ecological and evolutionary principles can guide disease mitigation in honeybees, including several practical management suggestions for addressing short- and long-term disease dynamics and consequences. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-09-01
Characterization of the copy number and variants of Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) in the pairs of honey bee pupa and infesting varroa destructor or Tropilaelaps mercedesae	Recent honey bee colony losses, particularly during the winter, have been shown to be associated with the presence of both ectoparasitic mites and Deformed Wing Virus (DWV). Whilst the role of Varroa destructor mites as a viral vector is well established, the role of Tropilaelaps mercedesae mites in viral transmission has not been fully investigated. In this study, we tested the effects that V. destructor and T. mercedesae infestation have on fluctuation of the DWV copy number and alteration of the virus variants in honey bees by characterizing individual pupae and their infesting mites. We observed that both mite species were associated with increased viral copy number in honey bee pupae. We found a positive correlation between DWV copy number in pupae and copy number in infesting mites, and the same DWV type A variant was present in either low or high copy number in both honey bee pupae and infesting V. destructor. These data also suggest that variant diversity is similar between honey bee pupae and the mites that infest them. These results support a previously proposed hypothesis that DWV suppresses the honey bee immune system when virus copy number reaches a specific threshold, promoting greater replication. © 2017 Wu, Dong and Kadowaki.

Thiacloprid alters social interactions among honey bee workers (Apis mellifera)	Experiments have shown that sublethal doses of neonicotinoids can interfere with honey bee (Apis mellifera) performance, yet sublethal effects on an individual level may be either enhanced or buffered against at the colony level, and this response to pesticide exposure depends on how it affects worker-worker interactions. We quantified worker interactions in experimental groups to assess the effects of thiacloprid on social network structure established by a group of worker individuals. We also quantified the amount of food exchanged via trophallaxis among worker individuals. Bees were force-fed a “low” dose of 0.17 μg or a “high” dose of 0.80 μg thiacloprid in 20 μl 2.7 M sucrose solution. Bees fed with thiacloprid significantly reduced their network centrality, but they nevertheless exchanged more food to other group members, which resulted in a dilution of the contaminated food. Hence, although thiacloprid may act as a general perturbator of social network structure, it still may play a role in the dynamics of disease transmission in the colony if pathogens are transmitted via food exchange. © 2017 International Bee Research Association.			2017-08-08
Effect of oxalic acid on the mite Varroa destructor and its host the honey bee Apis mellifera	Here, we study the effect of oxalic acid on isolated varroa mites and on varroa mites parasitizing caged honey bees treated with oxalic acid per os or topically (by trickling or by sublimation). We also study the effect of oxalic acid (trickling and sublimation) on individual bees, focusing on their lifespan, midgut morphology and function, and Malpighian tubule morphology. Effect on mites: contact of isolated mites with oxalic acid coated surface (Petri dishes treated by sublimation) significantly decreased mite viability. In an experiment on varroa mites parasitizing caged bees treated with oxalic acid, the strongest acaricidal effect was observed following oral application and the lowest when oxalic acid was applied through sublimation. Effect on bees: oxalic acid applied by sublimation did not decrease bee lifespan over the 21 days of observation contrary to trickling, where a nonsignificant lifespan decrease was observed. Topical application of oxalic acid increased the rate of midgut cell apoptosis, with a stronger statistically significant effect seen in the group treated by trickling. However, neither trickling nor sublimation caused epithelial destruction in the midgut and Malpighian tubules or loss of digestive tract function. © 2017 International Bee Research Association.			2017-08-08
Identification of stingless bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in Kenya using morphometrics and DNA barcoding	Stingless bees are important pollinators of wild plants and crops. The identity of stingless bee species in Africa has not been fully documented. The present study explored the utility of morphometrics and DNA barcoding for identification of African stingless bee populations, and to further employ these tools to identify potential cryptic variation within species. Stingless bee samples were collected from three ecological zones, namely Kakamega Forest, Mwingi and Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, which are geographically distant and cover high, medium and low altitudes, respectively. Forewing and hind leg morphometric characters were measured to determine the extent of morphological variation between the populations. DNA barcodes were generated from the mitochondrial cytochrome c-oxidase I (COI) gene. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the morphometric measurements separated the bee samples into three clusters: (1) Meliponula bocandei; (2) Meliponula lendliana + Plebeina hildebrandti; (3) Dactylurina schmidti + Meliponula ferruginea black + Meliponula ferruginea reddish brown, but Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) separated all the species except the two morphospecies (M. ferruginea reddish brown and black). The analysis of the COI sequences showed that DNA barcoding can be used to identify all the species studied and revealed remarkable genetic distance (7.3%) between the two M. ferruginea morphs. This is the first genetic evidence that M. ferruginea black and M. ferruginea reddish brown are separate species. © 2017 International Bee Research Association.			2017-08-08
Larval exposure to thiamethoxam and American foulbrood: effects on mortality and cognition in the honey bee Apis mellifera	Here, we examined the in vitro effects of co-exposure to a pathogen and a common neonicotinoid on honey bee larvae survival and on adult learning behavior following a standard olfactory conditioning procedure based on the proboscis extension response paradigm. We exposed or co-exposed honey bee larvae to American foulbrood and to sub-lethal doses of thiamethoxam (chronic exposure). Our results revealed no additive effects between the two stressors on larval mortality. However, the present work provides the first evidence of impaired learning and memory in adult bees that were fed thiamethoxam (0.6 ng/bee) during the larval stage. We also show no alterations in learning and memory in bees after infection with American foulbrood at the larval stage. The present study contributes to our knowledge of the sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoids on honey bee larvae and adults. © 2017 International Bee Research Association.			2017-08-08
Risk-risk tradeoffs: what should we do in Europe?	Risk-risk tradeoffs occur when a regulator focuses on decreasing one particular risk in one area which leads to another risk appearing elsewhere which was not originally considered. These risk-risk tradeoffs abound all around us and are frequently ignored by regulators. In this article we firstly, examine why risk-risk tradeoffs are often ignored. Secondly we summarize some of the criticisms to the use of risk-risk tradeoffs and then we look at the phenomenon via a number of European based case studies. In the final section of the paper we put forward a series of recommendations to help regulators to be better equipped in dealing with risk-risk tradeoffs. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Energy-efficient wireless sensor networks for precision agriculture: A review	Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be used in agriculture to provide farmers with a large amount of information. Precision agriculture (PA) is a management strategy that employs information technology to improve quality and production. Utilizing wireless sensor technologies and management tools can lead to a highly effective, green agriculture. Based on PA management, the same routine to a crop regardless of site environments can be avoided. From several perspectives, field management can improve PA, including the provision of adequate nutrients for crops and the wastage of pesticides for the effective control of weeds, pests, and diseases. This review outlines the recent applications of WSNs in agriculture research as well as classifies and compares various wireless communication protocols, the taxonomy of energy-efficient and energy harvesting techniques for WSNs that can be used in agricultural monitoring systems, and comparison between early research works on agriculture-based WSNs. The challenges and limitations of WSNs in the agricultural domain are explored, and several power reduction and agricultural management techniques for long-term monitoring are highlighted. These approaches may also increase the number of opportunities for processing Internet of Things (IoT) data. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Honey bee (Apis mellifera) colony health and pathogen composition in migratory beekeeping operations involved in California almond pollination	Honey bees are important pollinators of agricultural crops. Pathogens and other factors have been implicated in high annual losses of honey bee colonies in North America and some European countries. To further investigate the relationship between multiple factors, including pathogen prevalence and abundance and colony health, we monitored commercially managed migratory honey bee colonies involved in California almond pollination in 2014. At each sampling event, honey bee colony health was assessed, using colony population size as a proxy for health, and the prevalence and abundance of seven honey bee pathogens was evaluated using PCR and quantitative PCR, respectively. In this sample cohort, pathogen prevalence and abundance did not correlate with colony health, but did correlate with the date of sampling. In general, pathogen prevalence (i.e., the number of specific pathogens harbored within a colony) was lower early in the year (January—March) and was greater in the summer, with peak prevalence occurring in June. Pathogen abundance in individual honey bee colonies varied throughout the year and was strongly associated with the sampling date, and was influenced by beekeeping operation, colony health, and mite infestation level. Together, data from this and other observational cohort studies that monitor individual honey bee colonies and precisely account for sampling date (i.e., day of year) will lead to a better understanding of the influence of pathogens on colony mortality and the effects of other factors on these associations. © 2017 Glenny et al.

Honey bee foraging ecology: Season but not landscape diversity shapes the amount and diversity of collected pollen	The availability of pollen in agricultural landscapes is essential for the successful growth and reproduction of honey bee colonies (Apis mellifera L.). The quantity and diversity of collected pollen can influence the growth and health of honey bee colonies, but little is known about the influence of landscape structure on pollen diet. In a field experiment, we rotated 16 honey bee colonies across 16 agricultural landscapes, used traps to collect samples of collected pollen and observed intra-colonial dance communication to gain information about foraging distances. DNA metabarcoding was applied to analyze mixed pollen samples. Neither the amount of collected pollen nor pollen diversity was related to landscape diversity. However, we found a strong seasonal variation in the amount and diversity of collected pollen in all sites independent of landscape diversity. The observed increase in foraging distances with decreasing landscape diversity suggests that honey bees compensated for lower landscape diversity by increasing their pollen foraging range in order to maintain pollen amount and diversity. Our results underscore the importance of a diverse pollen diet for honey bee colonies. Agri-environmental schemes aiming to support pollinators should focus on possible spatial and temporal gaps in pollen availability and diversity in agricultural landscapes. © 2017 Danner et al.

Transcriptional signatures of parasitization and markers of colony decline in Varroa-infested honey bees (Apis mellifera)	Extensive annual losses of honey bee colonies (Apis mellifera L.) reported in the northern hemisphere represent a global problem for agriculture and biodiversity. The parasitic mite Varroa destructor, in association with deformed wing virus (DWV), plays a key role in this phenomenon, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. To elucidate these mechanisms, we analyzed the gene expression profile of uninfested and mite infested bees, under laboratory and field conditions, highlighting the effects of parasitization on the bee's transcriptome under a variety of conditions and scenarios. Parasitization was significantly correlated with higher viral loads. Honey bees exposed to mite infestation exhibited an altered expression of genes related to stress response, immunity, nervous system function, metabolism and behavioural maturation. Additionally, mite infested young bees showed a gene expression profile resembling that of forager bees. To identify potential molecular markers of colony decline, the expression of genes that were commonly regulated across the experiments were subsequently assessed in colonies experiencing increasing mite infestation levels. These studies suggest that PGRP-2, hymenoptaecin, a glucan recognition protein, UNC93 and a p450 cytocrome maybe suitable general biomarkers of Varroa-induced colony decline. Furthermore, the reliability of vitellogenin, a yolk protein previously identified as a good marker of colony survival, was confirmed here. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd		biological marker, insect protein, vitellogenin, animal, bee, colony collapse, gene expression profiling, genetics, host parasite interaction, insect virus, metabolism, parasitology, physiology, Varroidae, virology, Animals, Bees, Biomarkers, Colony Collapse, Gene Expression Profiling, Host-Parasite Interactions, Insect Proteins, Insect Viruses, Varroidae, Vitellogenins	2017-08-01
Effects of Bacillus thuringiensis strains virulent to Varroa destructor on larvae and adults of Apis mellifera	The sublethal effects of two strains of Bacillus thuringiensis, which were virulent in vitro to Varroa destructor, were measured on Apis mellifera. The effects of five concentrations of total protein (1, 5, 25, 50 and 100 μg/mL) from the EA3 and EA26.1 strains on larval and adult honey bees were evaluated for two and seven days under laboratory conditions. Based on the concentrations evaluated, total protein from the two strains did not affect the development of larvae, the syrup consumption, locomotor activity or proboscis extension response of adults. These same parameters were also tested for the effects of three concentrations (1, 10 and 15 μg/kg) of cypermethrin as a positive control. Although no significant differences were observed after two days of treatment with cypermethrin, a dose-response relationship in syrup consumption and locomotor activity was observed. A significant reduction in the proboscis extension response of the bees treated with cypermethrin was also observed. Therefore, in contrast to cypermethrin, our results indicate that the EA3 and EA26.1 strains of B. thuringiensis can be used in beehives to control V. destructor and reduce the negative effects of this mite on colonies without adverse effects on the larvae and adults of A. mellifera. Additionally, the overuse of synthetic miticides, which produce both lethal and sublethal effects on bees, can be reduced. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.		cypermethrin, protein, acaricide, bacterial protein, pyrethroid, adult, bacterium, biological control, cypermethrin, honeybee, larva, mite, protein, sublethal effect, analysis of variance, Apis mellifera, Article, Bacillus thuringiensis, bacterial strain, bacterial virulence, bioassay, biodiversity, biological pest control, concentration response, controlled study, environmental temperature, food intake, foraging behavior, locomotion, nonhuman, Varroa destructor, animal, apiculture, Bacillus thuringiensis, bee, dose response, drug effects, growth, development and aging, host parasite interaction, metabolism, microbiology, motor activity, parasitology, pathogenicity, pupa, tick control, Varroidae, virulence, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Bacillus thuringiensis, Varroa destructor, Acaricides, Animals, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacterial Proteins, Beekeeping, Bees, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Host-Parasite Interactions, Motor Activity, Pest Control, Biological, Pupa, Pyrethrins, Tick Control, Varroidae, Virulence	2017-08-01
Fitness in invasive social wasps: the role of variation in viral load, immune response and paternity in predicting nest size and reproductive output	Within any one habitat, the relative fitness of organisms in a population can vary substantially. Social insects like the common wasp are among the most successful invasive animals, but show enormous variation in nest size and other fitness-related traits. Some of this variation may be caused by pathogens such as viruses that can have serious consequences in social insects, which range from reduced productivity to colony death. Both individual immune responses and colony-level traits such as genetic diversity are likely to influence effects of pathogen infections on colony fitness. Here we investigate how infections with Kashmir Bee Virus (KBV), immune response and intracolony genetic diversity (due to queen polyandry) affect nest size in the invasive common wasp Vespula vulgaris. We show that KBV is highly prevalent in wasps and expression of antiviral immune genes is significantly increased with higher viral loads across individuals. Patriline membership within a nest did not influence KBV susceptibility or immune response. A permutational MANCOVA revealed that polyandry, viral load and expression of the immune gene Dicer were significant predictors of variation in nest size. High intracolony genetic diversity due to polyandry has previously been hypothesized to improve colony-level resistance to parasites and pathogens. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed genetically diverse colonies to be significantly larger and to produce more queens, although this effect was not driven by the pathogen we investigated. Invasive wasps clearly suffer from pathogens and expend resources, as indicated here by elevated immune gene expression, toward reducing pathogen-impact on colony fitness. © 2017 The Authors		colony, gene expression, genetic variation, immune response, paternity, pathogen, polyandry, social insect, virulence, wasp, Animalia, Hexapoda, Kashmir bee virus, Vespula vulgaris	2017-08-01
Differential physiological effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on honey bees: A comparison between Apis mellifera and Apis cerana	Acute toxicities (LD50s) of imidacloprid and clothianidin to Apis mellifera and A. cerana were investigated. Changing patterns of immune-related gene expressions and the activities of four enzymes between the two bee species were compared and analyzed after exposure to sublethal doses of insecticides. Results indicated that A. cerana was more sensitive to imidacloprid and clothianidin than A. mellifera. The acute oral LD50 values of imidacloprid and clothianidin for A. mellifera were 8.6 and 2.0 ng/bee, respectively, whereas the corresponding values for A. cerana were 2.7 and 0.5 ng/bee. The two bee species possessed distinct abilities to mount innate immune response against neonicotinoids. After 48 h of imidacloprid treatment, carboxylesterase (CCE), prophenol oxidase (PPO), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities were significantly downregulated in A. mellifera but were upregulated in A. cerana. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity was significantly elevated in A. mellifera at 48 h after exposure to imidacloprid, but no significant change was observed in A. cerana. AChE was downregulated in both bee species at three different time points during clothianidin exposure, and GST activities were upregulated in both species exposed to clothianidin. Different patterns of immune-related gene expression and enzymatic activities implied distinct detoxification and immune responses of A. cerana and A. mellifera to imidacloprid and clothianidin. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.		clothianidin, guanidine derivative, histocompatibility antigen, imidacloprid, insecticide, neonicotinoid, nitro derivative, thiazole derivative, animal, bee, chemistry, comparative study, drug effects, species difference, Animals, Bees, Guanidines, Histocompatibility Antigens, Insecticides, Neonicotinoids, Nitro Compounds, Species Specificity, Thiazoles	2017-08-01
Ecological stoichiometry of the honeybee: Pollen diversity and adequate species composition are needed to mitigate limitations imposed on the growth and development of bees by pollen quality	The least understood aspects of the nutritional needs of bees are the elemental composition of pollen and the bees’ need for a stoichiometrically balanced diet containing the required proportions of nutrients. Reduced plant diversity has been proposed as an indirect factor responsible for the pollinator crisis. We suggest stoichiometric mismatch resulting from a nutritionally unbalanced diet as a potential direct factor. The concentrations and stoichiometric ratios of C, N, S, P, K, Na, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Mn, and Cu were studied in the bodies of honeybees of various castes and sexes and in the nectar and pollen of various plant species. A literature review of the elemental composition of pollen was performed. We identified possible co-limitations of bee growth and development resulting mainly from the scarcity of Na, S, Cu, P and K, and possibly Zn and N, in pollen. Particular castes and sexes face specific limitations. Concentrations of potentially limiting elements in pollen revealed high taxonomic diversity. High floral diversity may be necessary to maintain populations of pollen eaters. Single-species crop plantations, even if these species are rich in nectar and pollen, might limit bee growth and development, not allowing for gathering nutrients in adequate proportions. However, particular plant species may play greater roles than others in balancing honeybee diets. Therefore, we suggest specific plant species that may (1) ensure optimal growth and production of individuals by producing pollen that is exceptionally well balanced stoichiometrically (e.g., clover) or (2) prevent growth and development of honeybees by producing pollen that is extremely unbalanced for bees (e.g., sunflower). Since pollen is generally poor in Na, this element must be supplemented using “dirty water”. Nectar cannot supplement the diet with limiting elements. Stoichiometric mismatch should be considered in intervention strategies aimed at improving the nutritional base for bees. © 2017 Filipiak et al.

A diverse range of novel RNA viruses in geographically distinct honey bee populations	Understanding the diversity and consequences of viruses present in honey bees is critical for maintaining pollinator health and managing the spread of disease. The viral landscape of honey bees (Apis mellifera) has changed dramatically since the emergence of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor, which increased the spread of virulent variants of viruses such as deformed wing virus. Previous genomic studies have focused on colonies suffering from infections by Varroa and virulent viruses, which could mask other viral species present in honey bees, resulting in a distorted view of viral diversity. To capture the viral diversity within colonies that are exposed to mites but do not suffer the ultimate consequences of the infestation, we examined populations of honey bees that have evolved naturally or have been selected for resistance to Varroa. This analysis revealed seven novel viruses isolated from honey bees sampled globally, including the first identification of negative-sense RNA viruses in honey bees. Notably, two rhabdoviruses were present in three geographically diverse locations and were also present in Varroa mites parasitizing the bees. To characterize the antiviral response, we performed deep sequencing of small RNA populations in honey bees and mites. This provided evidence of a Dicer-mediated immune response in honey bees, while the viral small RNA profile in Varroa mites was novel and distinct from the response observed in bees. Overall, we show that viral diversity in honey bee colonies is greater than previously thought, which encourages additional studies of the bee virome on a global scale and which may ultimately improve disease management. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.		dicer, Article, controlled study, enzyme activity, geographic origin, honeybee, immune response, infestation, nonhuman, organismal interaction, population research, priority journal, Rhabdoviridae, RNA sequence, RNA virus, species diversity, Varroa, virus identification, virus isolation, animal, bee, biodiversity, classification, genetic variation, genetics, isolation and purification, parasitology, RNA virus, Varroidae, virology, Animals, Bees, Biodiversity, Genetic Variation, RNA Viruses, Varroidae	2017-08-01
Mosquito-specific and mosquito-borne viruses: evolution, infection, and host defense	Recent virus discovery programs have identified an extensive reservoir of viruses in arthropods. It is thought that arthropod viruses, including mosquito-specific viruses, are ancestral to vertebrate-pathogenic arboviruses. Mosquito-specific viruses are restricted in vertebrate cells at multiple levels, including entry, RNA replication, assembly, and by the inability to replicate at high temperatures. Moreover, it is likely that the vertebrate immune system suppresses replication of these viruses. The evolution from single to dual-host tropism may also require changes in the course of infection in the mosquito host. In this review we explore the adaptive changes required for a switch from a mosquito-specific to a mosquito-borne transmission cycle. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.			2017-08-01
Effects of parasites and pathogens on bee cognition	1. Bees are key pollinators and their widespread decline has raised considerable concerns regarding the sustainability of ecosystems and food production. Many environmental stressors do not directly kill bees, but they alter their physiology and behaviour, ultimately impacting colonies and populations. 2. This review considers the impact of parasites and pathogens on bee cognition. 3. First the main parasites and pathogens of bees are described, as well as how they modify the foraging behaviour, learning and memory of their hosts. 4. Next, the various defence mechanisms developed by bees to mitigate these effects at both the individual and collective levels are examined. 5. Finally, there is a discussion on how integrating research on host parasites, animal behaviour and cognition will provide a more detailed assessment of the contribution of parasites and pathogens to declines in the bee population and help to inform constructive ecological interventions. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society		Animalia, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Crithidia, Nosema, Varroa	2017-08-01

Osmotic concentration in three races of honey bee, Apis mellifera L. under environmental conditions of arid zone	Hemolymph osmolarity has great effect on honey bee health, especially in arid and semi-arid zones. It regulates water and nutrients in stressed tissues. Osmotic concentration in three races (Apis mellifera ligustica, A. m. carnica and A. m. jemenitica) of Apis mellifera was tested in central Saudi Arabia during spring and summer seasons in 2015. Newly emerged bee workers were first marked and later their hemolymph was extracted after intervals of 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 days. A significant positive correlation between age and osmolarity was found in all three races during spring and summer seasons. The lowest combined osmotic concentration for all three races was found after 1 day interval, while the highest osmotic concentration was recorded after 25 days. Among all races, A. m. ligustica showed significantly high osmotic concentration after 25 days in spring and summer seasons as compared to the other two races. Only A. m. jemenitica showed similar osmotic concentration after 10 and 15 days in both spring and summer seasons compared to other two races. Mean osmotic concentration of all three races was significantly different after 20 and 25 days in spring and summer seasons. Overall mean recorded during summer was significantly higher than the mean of spring season. Combined osmotic concentration in young drones of all races was significantly lower than that of old drones during spring and summer seasons. © 2016			2017-07-01
Nosemosis in worker bees and their relationship with environmental factors in Jalisco, Mexico	Nosemosis is caused by Nosema spp microsporidium that parasites the midgut of adult worker bees, it is mortal in its acute form and causes very important economic losses for the beekeeper. The knowledge of the infection caused by N. spp in worker bees can help to prevent the spreading or control infection between colonies. The objective of the present work was to determine the presence and intensity of infection of N. spp in worker bees' colonies and its relation with temperature, pluvial precipitation and altitude in this region. Samples of Apis mellifera workers (n=352) were obtained from eight municipalities of south southwest of Jalisco. For the diagnosis, the abdomen tenderize method (Cantwell) was used and the Jaycox method to obtain the number of spores by bee. One hundred percent of the samples resulted positive, and 83.75 % of them between 1 to 5 million spores of by bee was presented. Weak correlations were obtained between the intensity of infection with the altitude (r= -0.35), the temperature (r= 0.44) and the pluvial precipitation (r= -0.12), for what can be suggested that these parameters do not majorly influence the presence of the disease. The obtained results suggest that all workers bees' colonies of the sampled municipalities should be treated in a periodic way with antibiotics, or biologic control removing each year older honeycombs in the colonies and the annual change of queens.		antibiotic agent, altitude, Apis mellifera, Article, bee, environmental factor, nonhuman, nosemosis, precipitation, temperature	2017-07-01
Food for honeybees? Pollinators and seed set of Anthyllis barba-jovis L. (Fabaceae) in arid coastal areas of the Mediterranean basin	Abundance and diversity of insect pollinators are declining in many ecosystems worldwide. The abundance and diversity of wild and managed bees are related to the availability of continuous floral resources. In particular, in Mediterranean basin countries, the presence of wildflower spots enhances the establishment of social Apoidea, since coastal regions are usually characterized by pollen and nectar shortage in early spring and late summer. Anthyllis barba-jovis produces both nectar and pollen as important food source for bees helping them to overcome early spring period food shortage. We investigated flowering, seed set, and pollinator diversity of A. barba-jovis in arid coastal environments of the Mediterranean basin. Pollinator abundance reached a maximum in early April. Honeybees were the most common pollinators followed by bumblebees and solitary bees. Plants prevented from entomophilous pollination showed inbreeding depression with a strong decrease in seed-set. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on pollination ecology of A. barba-jovis. © 2017 The Authors			2017-07-01
Effects of synthetic acaricides on honey bee grooming behavior against the parasitic Varroa destructor mite	Varroa destructor is currently one of the main threats for western apiculture. Today, synthetic acaricides (specifically coumaphos, amitraz, and tau-fluvalinate) are the most common methods to control Varroa infestations. These compounds, however, are frequently related to a wide range of side effects in the host, as well as a long half-life inside the hive matrices (wax and honey). The western honey bee, Apis mellifera, exhibits natural defense mechanisms against the mite such as grooming behavior, which is a sequence of bodily movements where the host scrapes its legs across its body surface to remove the mite. We tested the effects of synthetic acaricides on the performance of grooming behavior by adult honey bee workers. We found that acaricide exposure prior to grooming delayed grooming and reduced the overall duration of grooming behavior. Our data add to a list of other sublethal behavioral consequences of acaricides that may subvert a comprehensive approach to Varroa control in managed colonies. © 2017, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		acaricide, adult, chemical compound, chemical control, grooming, honeybee, mite, parasite, Acari, Apis mellifera, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2017-07-01
Continuous release of oregano oil effectively and safely controls Varroa destructor infestations in honey bee colonies in a northern climate	The ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor is responsible for the death of millions of honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies worldwide. Testing potential miticide compounds with different delivery methods that effectively control V. destructor and have low toxicity for honey bees is crucial to manage this parasite in hives. We determined the varroacide efficacy of three natural compounds delivered to hives with three application methods over a 4-week period. Oxalic acid in a sucrose solution was applied impregnated in cardboard (T1). A mixture of oregano and clove oils in an ethanol-gelatin solution was applied impregnated in absorbent pads (T2). Oregano oil alone was delivered using electric vaporizers (T3) to test the hypothesis that continuous release of miticides increases the varroacidal efficacy of essential oils. The varroa mite control rates for treatments T1–T3 were 76.5 ± 7.11, 57.8 ± 12.79 and 97.4 ± 0.68%, respectively, and there were no differences for bee mortality between control and treatments 1 and 3. Additionally, most mites were killed in the first 2 weeks in T3 colonies compared to the last 2 weeks in colonies of the other treatments. These results demonstrate the importance of continuously releasing natural miticides to achieve safe and high rates of mite control in hives. They also show that oregano oil may be an effective miticide against V. destructor infestations in colonies. © 2017, The Author(s).		biological control, climate conditions, ectoparasite, honeybee, insecticide, mite, mortality, numerical method, parasite control, parasite infestation, potential biocontrol agent, vegetable oil, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Origanum, Syzygium aromaticum, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2017-07-01
Influence of different pollen diets on the development of hypopharyngeal glands and size of acid gland sacs in caged honey bees (Apis mellifera)	We examined the consumption rate of protein diets in caged and free-flying honey bees, amino acid composition of diets, and diet effects on gland development. The effect of seven different diets (sugar solution only, Feedbee®, Helianthus pollen, Sinapis pollen, Asparagus pollen, Castanea pollen, and mixed pollen diet) on the development of the hypopharyngeal (HPG) and acid glands (AG) was tested in caged honey bees. Caged bees consumed the protein diet mainly at the age of 1–8 days, with the highest consumption rate on day 3. Different diets affected the development of both glands. The acini of HPG attained their maximum size in caged bees at an age of 5 days. Bees fed with Castanea sp., Asparagus sp., or mixed pollen had the largest glands among all test groups of this age. The AG sacs of caged bees grew in size between 5 and 12 days and were at day 18 less affected by different protein diets. Castanea sp. and mixed pollen diets were preferably consumed in free-flying colonies. © 2016, The Author(s).		biological development, cage culture, developmental biology, diet, endocrine system, food consumption, honeybee, nutrition, pollen, protein, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Asparagus, Castanea, Helianthus, Sinapis	2017-07-01
The effects of clove oil on the enzyme activity of Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman (Arachnida: Acari: Varroidae)	Varroa destructor, a key biotic threat to the Western honey bee, has played a major role in colony losses over the past few years worldwide. Overuse of traditional acaricides, such as tau-fluvalinate and flumethrin, on V. destructor has only increased its tolerance to them. Therefore, the application of essential oils in place of traditional pesticides is an attractive alternative, as demonstrated by its high efficiency, lack of residue and tolerance resistance. To study the acaricidal activity of essential oils, we used clove oil (Syzygium aromaticum L.), a typical essential oil with a wide range of field applications, and examined its effects on the enzyme activities of Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and its effects on the water-soluble protein content of V. destructor body extracts after exposure to 0.1 μl and 1.0 μl of clove oil for 30 min. Our results showed that the water-soluble protein content significantly decreased after the treatments, indicating that the metabolism of the mites was adversely affected. The bioactivity of GSTs increased significantly after a low dosage (0.1 μl) exposure but decreased at a higher dosage (1.0 μl), while the activities of SOD and Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase were significantly elevated after treatments. These results suggest that the protective enzyme SOD and detoxifying enzymes Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase and GST contributed to the stress reaction of V. destructor to the essential oils and that the detoxification ability of V. destructor via GST was inhibited at higher dosages. Our findings are conducive to understanding the physiological reactions of V. destructor to treatment with essential oils and the underlying mechanisms behind the acaricidal activities of these natural products. © 2017 The Authors			2017-07-01
Comparative study on the dynamics and performances of Apis mellifera jemenitica and imported hybrid honeybee colonies in southwestern Saudi Arabia	The aims of this study were to assess the seasonal population dynamics and evaluate the performance of Apis mellifera jemenitica (local bee) and introduced hybrid honeybee colonies in the lowlands and highlands of southwestern Saudi Arabia. Data regarding the performance and population dynamics parameters such as brood and adult bee population, amounts of stored pollen and nectar were gathered from the two races (25 colonies of each) for one year (April 2013 through March 2014), and statistically tested. The results indicated that at low lands, local bee colonies maintained relatively high brood and adult bee populations (P < 0.05) than introduced honeybee colonies and produced more (P < 0.05) honey. The local bee colonies were able to hoard three times more (P < 0.05) pollen and built more (P < 0.05) queen cells than introduced bees in both the low and highland areas. The annual survival rate of local bee colonies was almost double (P < 0.05) than that of introduced honeybee colonies. Moreover, local bees had greater (P < 0.05) adult bee and brood populations than imported, throughout the year. The relatively good performance of local colonies could be due to their long year's adaptation to cope with resource scarcity and unpredictable environmental conditions of the regions. The possible reasons for the dwindling of the imported hybrid colonies could be due to continuing to exhibit adaptive characteristics of their original that might not fit well with the new environment. © 2017 The Authors			2017-07-01
Performance of honey bee colonies under a long-lasting dietary exposure to sublethal concentrations of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiacloprid	BACKGROUND: Substantial honey bee colony losses have occurred periodically in the last decades. The drivers for these losses are not fully understood. The influence of pests and pathogens are beyond dispute, but in addition, chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations of pesticides has been suggested to affect the performance of honey bee colonies. This study aims to elucidate the potential effects of a chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations (one realistic worst-case concentration) of the neonicotinoid thiacloprid to honey bee colonies in a three year replicated colony feeding study. RESULTS: Thiacloprid did not significantly affect the colony strength. No differences between treatment and control were observed for the mortality of bees, the infestation with the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and the infection levels of viruses. No colony losses occurred during the overwintering seasons. Furthermore, thiacloprid did not influence the constitutive expression of the immunity-related hymenoptaecin gene. However, upregulation of hymenoptaecin expression as a response to bacterial challenge was less pronounced in exposed bees than in control bees. CONCLUSION: Under field conditions, bee colonies are not adversely affected by a long-lasting exposure to sublethal concentrations of thiacloprid. No indications were found that field-realistic and higher doses exerted a biologically significant effect on colony performance. © 2017 The Authors.

Persistence of subclinical deformed wing virus infections in honeybees following Varroa mite removal and a bee population turnover	Deformed wing virus (DWV) is a lethal virus of honeybees (Apis mellifera) implicated in elevated colony mortality rates worldwide and facilitated through vector transmission by the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor. Clinical, symptomatic DWV infections are almost exclusively associated with high virus titres during pupal development, usually acquired through feeding by Varroa mites when reproducing on bee pupae. Control of the mite population, generally through acaricide treatment, is essential for breaking the DWV epidemic and minimizing colony losses. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of remedial mite control on clearing DWV from a colony. DWV titres in adult bees and pupae were monitored at 2 week intervals through summer and autumn in acaricide-treated and untreated colonies. The DWV titres in Apistan treated colonies was reduced 1000-fold relative to untreated colonies, which coincided with both the removal of mites and also a turnover of the bee population in the colony. This adult bee population turnover is probably more critical than previously realized for effective clearing of DWV infections. After this initial reduction, subclinical DWV titres persisted and even increased again gradually during autumn, demonstrating that alternative non-Varroa transmission routes can maintain the DWV titres at significant subclinical levels even after mite removal.

Viral and intestinal diseases detected in apis mellifera in central and southern Chile	The honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) is an important pollinator worldwide. Beekeepers have experienced an increasing loss of colonies in recent years and pathologies including viruses and intestinal parasites such as Nosema ceranae are among those held responsible for this decline. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and distribution, using the real time PCR method, of six honeybee viruses including Deformed Wing Virus (DWV), Black Queen Cell Virus (BQCV), Sacbrood Virus (SBV), Acute Bee Paralysis Virus (ABPV), Chronic Bee Paralysis Virus (CBPV) and Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) in addition to three intestinal parasites, N. ceranae, N. apis and Lotmaria passim in Chilean beehives distributed between the Metropolitan Region and La Araucanía Region. Among the viruses, BQCV was the most prevalent in the analyzed hives, ranging from 72% to 100%, N. ceranae was detected between 19% to 53% and L. passim showed infections ranging from 45% to 73%. Similarly, BQCV (96%) and N. ceranae (42%) were more prevalent in spring-summer whilst DWV (37%) and L. passim (68%) were more frequents in autumn-winter seasons. Furthermore, mixed infections were also detected, wherein viruses were found along with L. passim or viruses with N. ceranae and L. passim, which proved to be the most prevalent. Of the 467 hives analyzed, 97.2% were infected with one or more of the studied pathogens, indicating that they are widely spread in Chile. © 2017, Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias, INIA.

Chronic exposure to neonicotinoids reduces honey bee health near corn crops	Experiments linking neonicotinoids and declining bee health have been criticized for not simulating realistic exposure. Here we quantified the duration and magnitude of neonicotinoid exposure in Canada’s corn-growing regions and used these data to design realistic experiments to investigate the effect of such insecticides on honey bees. Colonies near corn were naturally exposed to neonicotinoids for up to 4 months - the majority of the honey bee’s active season. Realistic experiments showed that neonicotinoids increased worker mortality and were associated with declines in social immunity and increased queenlessness over time. We also discovered that the acute toxicity of neonicotinoids to honey bees doubles in the presence of a commonly encountered fungicide. Our work demonstrates that field-realistic exposure to neonicotinoids can reduce honey bee health in corn-growing regions. © 2017, American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Quality of augmented reality experience: A correlation analysis	We performed a user study in which we investigated the user experience of HoloBee, a visual analytics system for the exploration of bee drift data. We compared two user interfaces, a head-mounted augmented reality (aR) interface and a desktop interface. We present here a correlation analysis of the user experience ratings that we collected in a questionnaire: intuitive, easy to use, comfortable, natural, and efficient. All criteria are strongly correlated with an interface preference rating. Efficient and comfortable are, respectively, found to be most and least strongly correlated with interface preference. Furthermore, while all rating criteria are highly correlated amongst themselves for the desktop interface, natural and intuitive are only marginally correlated for the AR interface indicating that natural user interfaces are not necessarily intuitive. © 2017 IEEE.

The geometric framework for nutrition reveals interactions between protein and carbohydrate during larval growth in honey bees	In holometabolous insects, larval nutrition affects adult body size, a life history trait with a profound influence on performance and fitness. Individual nutritional components of larval diets are often complex and may interact with one another, necessitating the use of a geometric framework for elucidating nutritional effects. In the honey bee, Apis mellifera, nurse bees provision food to developing larvae, directly moderating growth rates and caste development. However, the eusocial nature of honey bees makes nutritional studies challenging, because diet components cannot be systematically manipulated in the hive. Using in vitro rearing, we investigated the roles and interactions between carbohydrate and protein content on larval survival, growth, and development in A. mellifera. We applied a geometric framework to determine how these two nutritional components interact across nine artificial diets. Honey bees successfully completed larval development under a wide range of protein and carbohydrate contents, with the medium protein (∼5%) diet having the highest survival. Protein and carbohydrate both had significant and non-linear effects ongrowth rate, with the highest growth rates observed on a medium-protein, low-carbohydrate diet. Diet composition did not have a statistically significant effect on development time. These results confirm previous findings that protein and carbohydrate content affect the growth of A. mellifera larvae. However, this study identified an interaction between carbohydrate and protein content that indicates a low-protein, high-carb diet has a negative effect on larval growth and survival. These results imply that worker recruitment in the hive would decline under low protein conditions, even when nectar abundance or honey stores are sufficient. © 2017.

Viral delivery of dsRNA for control of insect agricultural pests and vectors of human disease: Prospects and challenges	RNAi is applied as a new and safe method for pest control in agriculture but efficiency and specificity of delivery of dsRNA trigger remains a critical issue. Various agents have been proposed to augment dsRNA delivery, such as engineered micro-organisms and synthetic nanoparticles, but the use of viruses has received relatively little attention. Here we present a critical view of the potential of the use of recombinant viruses for efficient and specific delivery of dsRNA. First of all, it requires the availability of plasmid-based reverse genetics systems for virus production, of which an overview is presented. For RNA viruses, their application seems to be straightforward since dsRNA is produced as an intermediate molecule during viral replication, but DNA viruses also have potential through the production of RNA hairpins after transcription. However, application of recombinant virus for dsRNA delivery may not be straightforward in many cases, since viruses can encode RNAi suppressors, and virus-induced silencing effects can be determined by the properties of the encoded RNAi suppressor. An alternative is virus-like particles that retain the efficiency and specificity determinants of natural virions but have encapsidated non-replicating RNA. Finally, the use of viruses raises important safety issues which need to be addressed before application can proceed. © 2017 Kolliopoulou, Taning, Smagghe and Swevers.

Video tracking protocol to screen deterrent chemistries for honey bees	The European honey bee, Apis mellifera L., is an economically and agriculturally important pollinator that generates billions of dollars annually. Honey bee colony numbers have been declining in the United States and many European countries since 1947. A number of factors play a role in this decline, including the unintentional exposure of honey bees to pesticides. The development of new methods and regulations are warranted to reduce pesticide exposures to these pollinators. One approach is the use of repellent chemistries that deter honey bees from a recently pesticide-treated crop. Here, we describe a protocol to discern the deterrence of honey bees exposed to select repellent chemistries. Honey bee foragers are collected and starved overnight in an incubator 15 h prior to testing. Individual honey bees are placed into Petri dishes that have either a sugar-agarose cube (control treatment) or sugar-agarose-compound cube (repellent treatment) placed into the middle of the dish. The Petri dish serves as the arena that is placed under a camera in a light box to record the honey bee locomotor activities using video tracking software. A total of 8 control and 8 repellent treatments were analyzed for a 10 min period with each treatment was duplicated with new honey bees. Here, we demonstrate that honey bees are deterred from the sugar-agarose cubes with a compound treatment whereas honey bees are attracted to the sugar-agarose cubes without an added compound. © 2017 Journal of Visualized Experiments.		insect repellent, pesticide, agriculture, animal, animal behavior, bee, drug effects, environmental monitoring, physiology, pollination, procedures, videorecording, Agriculture, Animals, Bees, Behavior, Animal, Environmental Monitoring, Insect Repellents, Pesticides, Pollination, Video Recording	2017-06-12
Propolis counteracts some threats to honey bee health	Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are constantly dealing with threats from pathogens, pests, pesticides and poor nutrition. It is critically important to understand how honey bees’ natural immune responses (individual immunity) and collective behavioral defenses (social immunity) can improve bee health and productivity. One form of social immunity in honey bee colonies is the collection of antimicrobial plant resins and their use in the nest architecture as propolis. We review research on the constitutive benefits of propolis on the honey bee immune system, and its known therapeutic, colony-level effects against the pathogens Paenibacillus larvae and Ascosphaera apis. We also review the limited research on the effects of propolis against other pathogens, parasites and pests (Nosema, viruses, Varroa destructor, and hive beetles) and how propolis may enhance bee products such as royal jelly and honey. Although propolis may be a source of pesticide contamination, it also has the potential to be a detoxifying agent or primer of detoxification pathways, as well as increasing bee longevity via antioxidant-related pathways. Throughout this paper, we discuss opportunities for future research goals and present ways in which the beekeeping community can promote propolis use in standard colonies, as one way to improve and maintain colony health and resiliency. © 2017 by the authors.

Healthy honey bees and sustainable maize production: Why not?	In the early 2000s, Italian beekeepers began to report bee mortality events linked to maize sowing. Evidence pointed to three neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam) and a phenylpyrazole (fipronil) used for seed dressing that were dispersed in the environment during sowing. Following these events and based on the precautionary principle, in September 2008, the Italian Ministry of Health suspended these four active ingredients as maize seed dressing. Here we show that in Italy after the precautionary suspension, the number of bee mortality events linked to maize sowing drastically declined. At the same time, the average annual maize production per hectare remained unchanged. This finding is indicative of the possibility to maintain stable maize productions without affecting honey bee health status. The implementation of Integrated Pest Management for maize production is discussed. © 2017, Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Bologna. All rights reserved.			2017-06-01
Higher immunocompetence is associated with higher genetic diversity in feral honey bee colonies (Apis mellifera)	Honey bees are the most important managed pollinators as they provide key ecosystem services for crop production worldwide. Recent losses of honey bee colonies in North America and Europe have demonstrated a need to develop strategies to improve their health and conserve their populations. Previously, we showed that feral honey bees—colonies that live in the wild without human assistance—exhibit higher levels of immunocompetence than managed colonies in North Carolina (USA). In a first attempt to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this difference in immune response, here we characterize the genetic composition of feral and managed honey bees using microsatellite markers. Our results reveal significant but small genetic differentiation between feral and managed honey bee colonies (ϕCT = 0.047, P = 0.03) indicating admixture between these two groups. Higher genetic diversity was correlated with higher immune response in feral (PMANOVA = 0.011) but not managed bees, despite the fact that the latter group showed significantly higher average genetic diversity (PANCOVA < 0.001). These findings suggest that genetic diversity is positively associated with immunocompetence in feral honey bee colonies, and that the benefits of genetic diversity are obscured in managed bees, perhaps as a result of artificial selection. We hypothesize that high genetic variability provides the raw material upon which natural selection acts and generates adaptive genotypes in unmanaged populations. Feral populations could be useful sources of genetic variation to use in breeding programs that aim to improve honey bee health. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.		antimicrobial activity, colony, ecosystem service, feral organism, genetic differentiation, genetic marker, genotype, honeybee, immune response, immunocompetence, peptide, pollinator, selection, Europe, North Carolina, United States, Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2017-06-01
Agricultural Landscape and Pesticide Effects on Honey Bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Biological Traits	Sixteen honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies were placed in four different agricultural landscapes to study the effects of agricultural landscape and exposure to pesticides on honey bee health. Colonies were located in three different agricultural areas with varying levels of agricultural intensity (AG areas) and one nonagricultural area (NAG area). Colonies were monitored for their performance and productivity for one year by measuring colony weight changes, brood production, and colony thermoregulation. Palynological and chemical analyses were conducted on the trapped pollen collected from each colony and location. Our results indicate that the landscape's composition significantly affected honey bee colony performance and development. Colony weight and brood production were significantly greater in AG areas compared to the NAG area. Better colony thermoregulation in AG areas' colonies was also observed. The quantities of pesticides measured in the trapped pollen were relatively low compared to their acute toxicity. Unexplained queen and colony losses were recorded in the AG areas, while colony losses because of starvation were observed in the NAG area. Our results indicate that landscape with high urban activity enhances honey bee brood production, with no significant effects on colony weight gain. Our study indicates that agricultural crops provide a valuable resource for honey bee colonies, but there is a trade-off with an increased risk of exposure to pesticides. © The Authors 2017.

Plant alkaloid sanguinarine and novel potential probiotic strains lactobacillus apis, lactobacillus melliventris and Gilliamella apicola promote resistance of honey bees to nematobacterial infection	Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are obligate insect parasites symbiotically associated with entomopathogenic bacteria. They can be used as a natural infection model combining bacterial infection with infection by multicellular parasite and as such, can be used in biological control and also offer a powerful tool to study insect immunity. Both mix of non-pathogenic bacteria and even nectar alkaloids were previously hypothesized to positively modulate honey bee health. We used EPNs for evaluating the overall immune resistance of honey bee larvae treated with potentially immuno-modulating substances - a plant alkaloid sanguinarine (extracted from Macleaya cordata) and non-pathogenic strains of Lactobacillus apis, Lactobacillus melliventris and Gilliamella apicola, native to honey bee gut isolates. Honey bee 5th instar larvae (L5) and white pupae were infected with Heterorhabditis bacteriophora or Steinernema feltiae, both carrying their symbiotic bacteria. In comparison to untreated honey bee larvae we observed an increase in survival of 13.5 ± 6.43 or 11.25 ± 5.77% in case of sanguinarine and S. feltiae or H. bacteriophora, respectively. Similarly, mix of above mentioned bacteria inoculated at the same time increased survivorship to 23.25 ± 1.53 or 11.0 ± 6.0% for S. feltiae or H. bacteriophora. This is the first record of use of nematobacterial infection for evaluating the immune status of a beneficial insect. Addition of low doses of both sanguinarine and non-pathogenic strains of selected bacteria had a positive impact on the resistance of honey bee to pathogen. This method can serve as a valuable tool for immunological tests in honey bees. © 2017, Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Bologna. All rights reserved.			2017-06-01
The Synergistic Effects of Almond Protection Fungicides on Honey Bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Forager Survival	The honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) contributes ∼$17 billion annually to the United States economy, primarily by pollinating major agricultural crops including almond, which is completely dependent on honey bee pollination for nut set. Almond growers face constant challenges to crop productivity owing to pests and pathogens, which are often controlled with a multitude of agrochemicals. For example, fungicides are often applied in combination with other products to control fungal pathogens during almond bloom. However, the effects of fungicides on honey bee health have been so far understudied. To assess the effects of some of the top fungicides used during the 2012 California almond bloom on honey bee forager mortality, we collected foragers from a local apiary and exposed them to fungicides (alone and in various combinations) at the label dose, or at doses ranging from 0.25 to 2 times the label dose rate. These fungicides were Iprodione 2SE Select, Pristine, and Quadris. We utilized a wind tunnel and atomizer set up with a wind speed of 2.9 m/s to simulate field-relevant exposure of honey bees to these agrochemicals during aerial application in almond fields. Groups of 40-50 foragers exposed to either untreated controls or fungicide-laden treatments were monitored daily over a 10-d period. Our results showed a significant decrease in forager survival resulting from exposure to simulated tank mixes of Iprodione 2SE Select, as well as synergistic detrimental effects of Iprodione 2SE Select in combination with Pristine and Quadris on forager survival. © The Authors 2017.

Acute contact toxicity of six pesticides in honeybees (Apis mellifera meda) in iran	Pollination has an important role in both agricultural production and wild plant reproduction. For the pollination of crops, agriculture relies largely on managed colonies of the honeybee Apis mellifera. Worker bees are primarily affected by pesticides. The symptoms of poisoning vary depending on the developmental stage of the individual bee and kind of chemical employed. The acute contact toxicity of insecticides (phosalone and pirimi-carb), acaricide (propargite), insecticide and acaricide (fenpropathrin), fungicides and bac-tericides (copper oxychloride and bordeaux mixture) was assessed in Iran through laboratory experiments. The median lethal concentrations (LC50-24h, LC50-48h and LC50-72h) were evaluated for the purposes of this research. Results showed that fenpropathrin had high toxicity; LC50-24h, LC50-48h and LC50-72h were 5.7, 3.2 and 2.9 ppm respectively. Additionally, the bordeaux mixture had the minimum contact toxicity on honeybees with LC50-24h, LC50-48h and LC50-72h being 79,926; 69,552 and 69,045 ppm respectively and was safe and non-toxic in honeybees. © 2017, RESEARCH INST POMOLOGY FLORICULTURE.

Environment or beekeeping management: What explains better the prevalence of honey bee colonies with high levels of Varroa destructor?	Varroa destructor is one of the major threats to honey bee colonies. The mite abundance in the colonies is affected by environmental conditions as well as by beekeeping management. The aim of this study was to recognize the main drivers associated with autumn V. destructor infestation in honey bee colonies when different regions from Argentina are compared. A total of 361 colonies distributed in five Argentinean eco-regions were examined to evaluate Varroa mite infestation rate during autumn and Nosema sp. presence. Regions were different regarding annual temperature, precipitation and especially vegetation landscape. In addition, beekeeping management practices were obtained from a checklist questionnaire answered by the beekeepers. The prevalence of colonies with high infestation level was lower in semi-arid Chaco followed by humid and transition Chaco regions. Also, colonies that were positive for Nosema sp. showed a higher Varroa infestation rate. The “environmental” effect was stronger compared with the influence of secondary drivers associated with beekeeping activities. As well, a significant association between V. destructor infestation rates and Nosema presence was identified. Under contrasting natural conditions, environment seems a predominant driver on Varroa destructor infestation level in honey bee colonies. ï¿½ 2017 Elsevier Ltd		adult, apiculture, Argentina, Article, autumn, climate, environmental temperature, geographic distribution, honeybee, land use, nonhuman, Nosema, organism colony, precipitation, varroosis, vegetation, animal, bee, host parasite interaction, parasitology, physiology, risk factor, Varroidae, Animals, Argentina, Beekeeping, Bees, Host-Parasite Interactions, Risk Factors, Varroidae	2017-06-01
Efficacy of plant-derived formulation "argus ras" in varroa destructor control	Varroa destructor is the most important honey bee parasite. There are various methods used in the control of this mite, but none of them meets all requested criteria, to be safe, effective and easy to apply. The objective of this study was to evaluate the varroacidal efficacy of newly created plant-derived formulation Argus Ras (mixture of extracts of Sophora flavescens, Ginkgo biloba, Gleditsia chinensis and Teucrium chamaedrys) in a field trial. The investigation was conducted on 240 Apis mellifera colonies equalized in respect of brood amount, adult bee population and food reserves. Efficiency was evaluated by applying Argus Ras consecutively with two other acaricides, amitraz and oxalic acid. Average acaricidal efficacy of Argus Ras was 80.89%, being higher of other previously tested essential oils. Besides, it showed a potential in knocking down the mites resistant to other acaricides. It should not be neglected that Argus Ras requires a smaller number of treatments and financial investments than other formulations used for the control of Varroa mites.		acaricide, amitraz, Argus Ras, Ginkgo biloba extract, Gleditsia chinensis extract, oxalic acid, plant extract, Sophora flavescens extract, Teucrium chamaedrys extract, unclassified drug, absence of side effects, adult, animal experiment, antimicrobial activity, Apis mellifera, Article, controlled study, follow up, fumigation, Ginkgo biloba, health behavior, herbal medicine, microsporidiosis, nonhuman, nosemosis, pollution, Sophora flavescens, Varroa destructor, varroosis	2017-06-01
The exposure of honey bees to pesticide residues in the hive environment with regard to winter colony losses	The present studies are the second part of the research project dedicated to finding the causes for increased winter mortality of honey bee colonies. The aim of this task was to investigate incidents of overwintered colonies’ death with regard to the potential interrelation to the exposure to pesticides. The samples of winter stores of bee bread and sugar food (honey or syrup processed by bees), beeswax and bees collected from apiaries with low and high rates of winter colony mortality were searched for acaricides used to control V. destructor and plant protection pesticides. The presence of acaricides used in apiculture has been detected in the 51% beeswax samples. The most abundant acaricide was tau-fluvalinate. The stores of bee bread and sugar food had a similar frequency of plant protection pesticide occurrence, ranging between 50–60%, but the number of active substances and their concentrations were substantially lower in sugar food samples. The most prevalent pesticides in pollen were fungicides (carbendazim and boscalid) and insecticides (acetamiprid and thiacloprid). Only a few pesticides were found in the several dead honey bees. The level of pesticide contamination (frequency, concentration, toxicity) of hive products and bees originating from apiaries with both a high and low winter colony survival rates, was similar, which created a similar extent of risk. Although the multiple varroacides and pesticides were present in the hive environment we not found unequivocal links between their residues and high winter colony mortality. © 2017, RESEARCH INST POMOLOGY FLORICULTURE.

Hygienic and grooming behaviors in African and European honeybees - New damage categories in Varroa destructor	Varroa destructor is an ectoparasitic pest of honeybees, and a threat to the survival of the apiculture industry. Several studies have shown that unlike European honeybees, African honeybee populations appear to be minimally affected when attacked by this mite. However, little is known about the underlying drivers contributing to survival of African honeybee populations against the mite. We hypothesized that resistant behavioral defenses are responsible for the survival of African honeybees against the ectoparasite. We tested this hypothesis by comparing grooming and hygienic behaviors in the African savannah honeybee Apis mellifera scutellata in Kenya and A. mellifera hybrids of European origin in Florida, USA against the mite. Grooming behavior was assessed by determining adult mite infestation levels, daily mite fall per colony and percentage mite damage (as an indicator of adult grooming rate), while hygienic behavior was assessed by determining the brood removal rate after freeze killing a section of the brood. Our results identified two additional undescribed damaged mite categories along with the six previously known damage categories associated with the grooming behavior of both honeybee subspecies. Adult mite infestation level was approximately three-fold higher in A. mellifera hybrids of European origin than in A. m. scutellata, however, brood removal rate, adult grooming rate and daily natural mite fall were similar in both honeybee subspecies. Unlike A. mellifera hybrids of European origin, adult grooming rate and brood removal rate did not correlate with mite infestation levels on adult worker honeybee of A. m. scutellata though they were more aggressive towards the mites than their European counterparts. Our results provide valuable insights into the tolerance mechanisms that contribute to the survival of A. m. scutellata against the mite.

A Mathematical Model of Forager Loss in Honeybee Colonies Infested with Varroa destructor and the Acute Bee Paralysis Virus	We incorporate a mathematical model of Varroa destructor and the Acute Bee Paralysis Virus with an existing model for a honeybee colony, in which the bee population is divided into hive bees and forager bees based on tasks performed in the colony. The model is a system of five ordinary differential equations with dependent variables: uninfected hive bees, uninfected forager bees, infected hive bees, virus-free mites and virus-carrying mites. The interplay between forager loss and disease infestation is studied. We study the stability of the disease-free equilibrium of the bee-mite-virus model and observe that the disease cannot be fought off in the absence of varroacide treatment. However, the disease-free equilibrium can be stable if the treatment is strong enough and also if the virus-carrying mites become virus-free at a rate faster than the mite birth rate. The critical forager loss due to homing failure, above which the colony fails, is calculated using simulation experiments for disease-free, treated and untreated mite-infested, and treated virus-infested colonies. A virus-infested colony without varroacide treatment fails regardless of the forager mortality rate. © 2017, Society for Mathematical Biology.			2017-06-01
Seasonal cycle of inbreeding and recombination of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor in honeybee colonies and its implications for the selection of acaricide resistance	Varroa destructor is the most devastating parasite of the Western honeybee, Apis mellifera. In the light of the arm race opposing the host and its parasite, the population dynamics and genetic diversity of these organisms are key parameters. However, the life cycle of V. destructor is characterized by extreme inbreeding due to full sibling mating in the host brood cells. We here present an equation reflecting the evolution of inbreeding in such a clonal system, and compare our predictions with empirical data based on the analysis of seven microsatellite markers. This comparison revealed that the mites perform essentially incestuous mating in the beginning of the brood season. However, this pattern changes with the development of mite infestation. Despite the fact that the overall level of genetic diversity of the mites remained low through the season, multiple inbred lineages were identified in the mites we sampled in June. As a response to the decrease of brood availability and the increase of the parasite population in parallel in the colonies, these lineages recombined towards the end of the season as mites co-infest brood cells. Our results suggest that the ratio of the number of mite per brood cell in the colony determines the genetic structure of the populations of V. destructor. This intracolonial population dynamics has great relevance for the selection of acaricide resistance in V. destructor. If chemical treatments occur before the recombination phase, inbreeding will greatly enhance the fixation of resistance alleles at the colony level. ï¿½ 2017 Elsevier B.V.		acaricide, acaricide, microsatellite DNA, allele, Apis mellifera, Article, gene structure, genetic variability, host cell, inbreeding, incest, insecticide resistance, microsatellite marker, mite infestation, nonhuman, organism colony, population dynamics, seasonal variation, sibling, summer, Varroa destructor, animal, bee, drug effects, drug resistance, female, genetic recombination, genetic variation, genetics, host parasite interaction, male, parasitology, season, Varroidae, Acaricides, Animals, Bees, Drug Resistance, Female, Genetic Variation, Host-Parasite Interactions, Inbreeding, Male, Microsatellite Repeats, Mite Infestations, Population Dynamics, Recombination, Genetic, Seasons, Varroidae	2017-06-01
Wildflower plantings do not compete with neighboring almond orchards for pollinator visits	The engineering of flowering agricultural field borders has emerged as a research and policy priority to mitigate threats to pollinators. Studies have, however, rarely addressed the potential that flowering field borders might compete with neighboring crops for pollinator visits if they both are in bloom at the same time, despite this being a concern expressed by growers. We evaluated how wildflower plantings added to orchard borders in a large (512 ha) commercial almond orchard affected honey bee and wild bee visitation to orchard borders and the crop. The study was conducted over two consecutive seasons using three large (0.48 ha) wildflower plantings paired with control orchard borders in a highly simplified agricultural landscape in California. Honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) and wild bee visitation to wildflower plots were at least an order of magnitude higher than to control plots, but increased honey bee visitation to wildflower plots did not lead to any detectable shifts in honey bee visitation to almond flowers in the neighboring orchard. Wild bees were rarely observed visiting almond flowers irrespective of border treatment, indicating a limited short-Term potential for augmenting crop pollination using wild bees in highly simplified agricultural landscapes. Although further studies are warranted on bee visitation and crop yield from spatially independent orchards, this study indicates that growers can support bees with alternative forage in almond orchards without risking competition between the wildflower plantings and the crop. © The Authors 2017.

Evaluation of persistence of insecticide toxicity in honey bees (Apis mellifera L.)	Study on persistence toxicity of different insecticides focusing newer compounds (imidacloprid, flipronil, and indoxacarb), conventional insecticides (dimethoate and cypermenthrin) and botanical insecticide (azadirachtin) to Apis mellifera was conducted on sunflower. Fipronil recorded higher residual toxicity to honey bees with a PT50value of 5.83 days. It was followed by imidacloprid (5.74 days), cypermethrin (4.38 days), dimethoate (2.56 days) and indoxacarb (2.02 days). The order of relative persistence of insecticides was: fipronil 45 g a.i./ha > imidacloprid 20 g a.i./ha > cypermethrin 65 g a.i./ha > dimethoate 200 g a.i./ha > indoxacarb 44 g a.i./ha. Residues of all tested insecticides persisted after the application was highly toxic to A. mellifera. Findings focus on the indirect application hazards to the honey bees. © 2017, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR) . All rights reserved.			2017-06-01
Formetanate toxicity and changes in antioxidant enzyme system of Apis mellifera larvae	Substantial percentage of world food production depends on pollinating service of honeybees that directly depends on their health status. Among other factors, the success of bee colonies depends on health of developed larvae. The crucial phase of larval development is the first 6 days after hatching when a worker larva grows exponentially and larvae are potentially exposed to xenobiotics via diet. In the present study, we determined the lethal concentration LC50 (72 h) following single dietary exposure of honeybee larvae to formetanate under laboratory conditions, being also the first report available in scientific literature. Activities of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) were also measured in the homogenates of in vitro reared honeybee larvae after single formetanate exposure. Decreased specific activity of SOD and increased activities of CAT and GST suggest the induction of oxidative stress. Higher levels of thiobarbituric reactive species in all samples supported this fact. Comparing determined larval toxicity (LC50 of 206.01 mg a.i./kg diet) with adult toxicity data, we can suppose that the larvae may be less sensitive to formetanate than the adult bees. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.		antioxidant, carbamate (ester), concentration (composition), diet, enzyme, enzyme activity, food production, hatching, honeybee, larva, larval development, oxidative stress, toxicity, xenobiotics, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, antioxidant, carbamic acid derivative, catalase, formetanate, animal, bee, drug effects, growth, development and aging, larva, LD50, Animals, Antioxidants, Bees, Carbamates, Catalase, Larva, Lethal Dose 50	2017-06-01
Toxicity assessment on honey bee larvae of a repeated exposition of a systemic fungicide, boscalid	Bees are key participators to the fertility of plants and yet they are suffering from losses and disorders. In other studies, double the amount of fungicides were found in colonies showing disorders than in healthy ones, with boscalid among the most frequently detected residues. Boscalid was mainly found in bee bread, main ingredient of larvae food and consequently exposing larvae to the compound in the long run. Here, we wanted to understand if boscalid could be toxic for immature stages of honey bees. Honey bee larvae were administered food to a range of doses from 0.04 to 40.25 µg boscalid/larva over 3 days. The NOED and LD50 at D8 were 4.025 µg a.i./larva and 86.786 µg a.i./larva, respectively; at D15 were 40.25 µg a.i./larva and 78.782 µg/larva, respectively; and at D22 were 40.25 µg/larva and 75.191 µg/larva, respectively. Worst-case field observed doses are 26 ppm in pollen and 1.43 ppm in nectar. Calculated concentration of boscalid safety for larvae would be 741 ppm for pollen and 27 ppm for nectar. However, our results with the active ingredient could be different than those observed for queen larvae, those obtained with the formulated product containing boscalid or in the field considering the exposure of bee hives to multiple pesticide contaminants. © 2017, Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Bologna.

Using publicly available data to quantify plant-pollinator interactions and evaluate conservation seeding mixes in the northern great plains	Concern over declining pollinators has led to multiple conservation initiatives for improving forage for bees in agroecosystems. Using data available through the Pollinator Library (npwrc.usgs.gov/pollinator/), we summarize plant-pollinator interaction data collected from 2012-2015 on lands managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and private lands enrolled in U.S. Department of Agriculture conservation programs in eastern North Dakota (ND). Furthermore, we demonstrate how plant-pollinator interaction data from the Pollinator Library and seed cost information can be used to evaluate hypothetical seeding mixes for pollinator habitat enhancements. We summarize records of 314 wild bee and 849 honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) interactions detected on 63 different plant species. The wild bee observations consisted of 46 species, 15 genera, and 5 families. Over 54% of all wild bee observations were represented by three genera-Bombus, Lassioglossum, and Melissodes. The most commonly visited forbs by wild bees were Monarda fistulosa, Sonchus arvensis, and Zizia aurea. The most commonly visited forbs by A. mellifera were Cirsium arvense, Melilotus officinalis, and Medicago sativa. Among all interactions, 13% of A. mellifera and 77% of wild bee observations were made on plants native to ND. Our seed mix evaluation shows that mixes may often need to be tailored to meet the unique needs of wild bees and managed honey bees in agricultural landscapes. Our evaluation also demonstrates the importance of incorporating both biologic and economic information when attempting to design cost-effective seeding mixes for supporting pollinators in a critically important part of the United States.		agricultural ecosystem, data acquisition, database, forage, honeybee, native species, plant-pollinator interaction, seed, seeding, spatiotemporal analysis, taxonomy, wild population, Great Plains, North Dakota, United States, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Cirsium arvense, Medicago sativa, Melilotus officinalis, Melissodes, Monarda fistulosa, Sonchus arvensis, Zizia aurea, agriculture, animal, bee, environmental protection, North Dakota, physiology, pollination, procedures, species difference, Agriculture, Animals, Bees, Conservation of Natural Resources, North Dakota, Pollination, Species Specificity	2017-06-01
Environmental contaminants of honeybee products in Uganda detected using LC-MS/MS and GC-ECD	Pollinator services and the development of beekeeping as a poverty alleviating tool have gained considerable focus in recent years in sub-Saharan Africa. An improved understanding of the pervasive environmental extent of agro-chemical contaminants is critical to the success of beekeeping development and the production of clean hive products. This study developed and validated a multi-residue method for screening 36 pesticides in honeybees, honey and beeswax using LC-MS/MS and GC-ECD. Of the 36 screened pesticides, 20 were detected. The highest frequencies occurred in beeswax and in samples from apiaries located in the proximity of citrus and tobacco farms. Fungicides were the most prevalent chemical class. Detected insecticides included neonicotinoids, organophosphates, carbamates, organophosphorus, tetrazines and diacylhydrazines. All detected pesticide levels were below maximum residue limits (according to EU regulations) and the lethal doses known for honeybees. However, future risk assessment is needed to determine the health effects on the African genotype of honeybees by these pesticide classes and combinations of these. In conclusion, our data present a significant challenge to the burgeoning organic honey sector in Uganda, but to achieve this, there is an urgent need to regulate the contact routes of pesticides into the beehive products. Interestingly, the zero° detection rate of pesticides in the Mid-Northern zone is a significant indicator of the large potential to promote Ugandan organic honey for the export market. © 2017 Amulen et al.

Effects of sublethal concentrations of chlorpyrifos on olfactory learning and memory performances in two bee species, Apis mellifera and Apis cerana	Chlorpyrifos is a widely used organophosphorus insecticide. The acute oral 24 h median lethal dose (LD50) value of chlorpyrifos in Apis mellifera and in Apis cerana was estimated to assess differential acute chlorpyrifos toxicity in both bee species. The LD50 values of chlorpyrifos in A. mellifera and in A. cerana are 103.4 ng/bee and 81.8 ng/bee, respectively, which suggests that A. cerana bees are slightly more sensitive than A. mellifera bees to the toxicity of chlorpyrifos. Doses half the acute LD50 of chlorpyrifos were selected to study behavioral changes in both bee species using proboscis extension response assay. A. mellifera foragers treated with chlorpyrifos showed significantly lower response to the 10% sucrose solution compared to control bees after 2, 24 and 48 h. Chlorpyrifos significantly impaired the olfactory learning abilities and 2 h memory retention of forager bees regardless of honey bee species, which may affect the foraging success of bees exposed to chlorpyrifos.			2017-06-01
Research progress of the interaction between Apis mellifera and Varroa destructor mediated by pheromones	Varroa destructor is a virulent ectoparasitic mite of western honeybee (Apis mellifera), and considered the greatest threat to apiculture around the world. Chemical method is widely used for the management of this mite. However, this method can easily induce the resistance of V. destructor to acaricides, toxicity of acaricides to honeybee and the residues in bee products. Therefore, many safe preventions and control techniques were developed to treat mite in recent years. Using pheromones of honeybee to control V. destructor would be a main tendency. A lot of studies indicated that Varroa mites are able to use honeybee pheromones to distinguish the development stages of the hosts, and show high selectivity for appropriate hosts at a special stage. In recent years, a lot of honey bee pheromones were reported to have effect on V. destructor, including pheromones from adult honeybee, pupa and brood. Some of them have repellent effect on V. destructor, while others have attractant effect on V. destructor. This article reviewed the progresses in pheromones categories, major chemical compositions, and their effects to V. destructor, which would suggest important avenues for further researches and applications in mite control. © 2017, Science Press.

Feeding toxicity and impact of imidacloprid formulation and mixtures with six representative pesticides at residue concentrations on honey bee physiology (Apis mellifera)	Imidacloprid is the most widely used insecticide in agriculture. In this study, we used feeding methods to simulate in-hive exposures of formulated imidacloprid (Advise® 2FL) alone and mixtures with six representative pesticides for different classes. Advise, fed at 4.3 mg/L (equal to maximal residue detection of 912 ppb active ingredient [a.i.] in pollen) induced 36% mortality and 56% feeding suppression after 2-week feeding. Treatments with individual Bracket (acephate), Karate (γ-cyhalothrin), Vydate (oxamyl), Domark (tetraconazole), and Roundup (glyphosate) at residue level had a mortality range of 1.3-13.3%, statistically similar to that of control (P>0.05). The additive/synergistic toxicity was not detected from binary mixtures of Advise with different classes of pesticides at residue levels. The feeding of the mixture of all seven pesticides increased mortality to 53%, significantly higher than Advise only but still without synergism. Enzymatic data showed that activities of invertase, glutathione S-Transferase, and acetylcholinesterase activities in imidacloprid-Treated survivors were mostly similar to those found in control. Esterase activity mostly increased, but was significantly suppressed by Bracket (acephate). The immunity-related phenoloxidase activity in imidacloprid-Treated survivors tended to be lower, but most treatments were statistically similar to the control. Increase of cytochrome P450 activity was correlated with Advise concentrations and reached significant difference at 56 mg/L (12 ppm a.i.). Our data demonstrated that residue levels of seven pesticide in pollens/hive may not adversely affect honey bees, but long term exclusive ingestion of the maximal residue levels of imidacloprid (912 ppb) and sulfoxaflor (3 ppm a.i.) may induce substantial bee mortality. Rotating with other insecticides is a necessary and practical way to reduce the residue level of any given pesticide.		acephate, acetylcholinesterase, cyhalothrin, cytochrome P450, fungicide, glutathione transferase, herbicide, imidacloprid, insecticide, monophenol monooxygenase, nicotinic receptor, oxamyl, tetraconazole, unclassified drug, antifungal agent, herbicide, imidacloprid, imidazole derivative, insecticide, nitro derivative, pesticide, pesticide residue, analysis of variance, Apis mellifera, Article, bioassay, chemical analysis, chemical interaction, chemical structure, controlled study, detoxification, environmental exposure, enzyme activity, feeding, fluorometry, forest management, mortality, nonhuman, organism colony, protein content, protein determination, animal, bee, body weight, drug effects, enzymology, feeding behavior, immunology, physiology, Animals, Antifungal Agents, Bees, Body Weight, Feeding Behavior, Herbicides, Imidazoles, Insecticides, Nitro Compounds, Pesticide Residues, Pesticides	2017-06-01
Synergistic mortality between a neonicotinoid insecticide and an ergosterol-biosynthesis-inhibiting fungicide in three bee species	BACKGROUND: Neonicotinoid insecticides have been identified as an important factor contributing to bee diversity declines. Nonetheless, uncertainties remain about their impact under field conditions. Most studies have been conducted on Apis mellifera and tested single compounds. However, in agricultural environments, bees are often exposed to multiple pesticides. We explore the synergistic mortality between a neonicotinoid (clothianidin) and an ergosterol-biosynthesis-inhibiting fungicide (propiconazole) in three bee species (A. mellifera, Bombus terrestris, Osmia bicornis) following oral exposure in the laboratory. RESULTS: We developed a new approach based on the binomial proportion test to analyse synergistic interactions. We estimated uptake of clothianidin per foraging bout in honey bees foraging on seed-coated rapeseed fields. We found significant synergistic mortality in all three bee species exposed to non-lethal doses of propiconazole and their respective LD10 of clothianidin. Significant synergism was only found at the first assessment times in A. mellifera (4 and 24 h) and B. terrestris (4 h), but persisted throughout the experiment (96 h) in O. bicornis. O. bicornis was also the most sensitive species to clothianidin. CONCLUSION: Our results underscore the importance to test pesticide combinations likely to occur in agricultural environments, and to include several bee species in environmental risk assessment schemes. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry		bee, clothianidin, dose-response relationship, ergosterol, fungicide, mortality, neonicotinoid pesticide, pollution exposure, risk assessment, sublethal effect, synergism, testing method, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Bombus terrestris, Brassica napus, Osmia	2017-06-01
Queen quality and the impact of honey bee diseases on queen health: Potential for interactions between two major threats to colony health	Western honey bees, Apis mellifera, live in highly eusocial colonies that are each typically headed by a single queen. The queen is the sole reproductive female in a healthy colony, and because long-term colony survival depends on her ability to produce a large number of offspring, queen health is essential for colony success. Honey bees have recently been experiencing considerable declines in colony health. Among a number of biotic and abiotic factors known to impact colony health, disease and queen failure are repeatedly reported as important factors underlying colony losses. Surprisingly, there are relatively few studies on the relationship and interaction between honey bee diseases and queen quality. It is critical to understand the negative impacts of pests and pathogens on queen health, how queen problems might enable disease, and how both factors influence colony health. Here, we review the current literature on queen reproductive potential and the impacts of honey bee parasites and pathogens on queens. We conclude by highlighting gaps in our knowledge on the combination of disease and queen failure to provide a perspective and prioritize further research to mitigate disease, improve queen quality, and ensure colony health. © 2017 by the authors.

Effects of Imidacloprid and Varroa destructor on survival and health of European honey bees, Apis mellifera	There has been growing concern over declines in populations of honey bees and other pollinators which are a vital part to our food security. It is imperative to identify factors responsible for accelerated declines in bee populations and develop solutions for reversing bee losses. While exact causes of colony losses remain elusive, risk factors thought to play key roles are ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor and neonicotinoid pesticides. The present study aims to investigate effects of a neonicotinoid pesticide Imidacloprid and Varroa mites individually on survivorship, growth, physiology, virus dynamics and immunity of honey bee workers. Our study provides clear evidence that the exposure to sublethal doses of Imidacloprid could exert a significantly negative effect on health and survival of honey bees. We observed a significant reduction in the titer of vitellogenin (Vg), an egg yolk precursor that regulates the honey bees development and behavior and often are linked to energy homeostasis, in bees exposed to Imidacloprid. This result indicates that sublethal exposure to neonicotinoid could lead to increased energy usage in honey bees as detoxification is a energy-consuming metabolic process and suggests that Vg could be a useful biomarker for measuring levels of energy stress and sublethal effects of pesticides on honey bees. Measurement of the quantitative effects of different levels of Varroa mite infestation on the replication dynamic of Deformed wing virus (DWV), an RNA virus associated with Varroa infestation, and expression level of immune genes yields unique insights into how honey bees respond to stressors under laboratory conditions. © 2016 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences		imidacloprid, imidazole derivative, insecticide, nitro derivative, vitellogenin, animal, bee, female, host parasite interaction, immunology, insect virus, metabolism, parasitology, physiology, toxicity testing, Varroidae, virology, Animals, Bees, Female, Host-Parasite Interactions, Imidazoles, Insect Viruses, Insecticides, Nitro Compounds, Toxicity Tests, Subacute, Varroidae, Vitellogenins	2017-06-01
Bee conservation in the age of genomics	Many wild and managed bee pollinators have experienced population declines over the past several decades, and molecular and population genetic tools have been valuable in understanding conservation threats across the bee tree of life. Emerging genomic tools have the potential to improve classical applications of conservation genetics, such as assessing species status, and quantifying genetic diversity, gene flow and effective population sizes. Genomic tools can also revolutionize novel research in bee conservation and management, including the identification of loci underlying adaptive and economically desirable traits, such as those involved in disease susceptibility, responses to multiple environmental stressors, and even discovering and understanding the hidden diversity of beneficial microorganisms associated with bees. In this perspective, we provide a survey of some of the ways genomic tools can be applied to bee conservation to bridge the gap between basic and applied genomics research. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.		bee, conservation genetics, conservation management, environmental response, environmental stress, gene flow, genetic variation, genome, genomics, pollination, pollinator, population decline, population genetics, population size, wild population, Apoidea	2017-06-01
The exposure of honey bees (Apis mellifera; Hymenoptera: Apidae) to pesticides: Room for improvement in research	Losses of honey bees have been repeatedly reported from many places worldwide. The widespread use of synthetic pesticides has led to concerns regarding their environmental fate and their effects on pollinators. Based on a standardised review, we report the use of a wide variety of honey bee matrices and sampling methods in the scientific papers studying pesticide exposure. Matrices such as beeswax and beebread were very little analysed despite their capacities for long-term pesticide storage. Moreover, bioavailability and transfer between in-hive matrices were poorly understood and explored. Many pesticides were studied but interactions between molecules or with other stressors were lacking. Sampling methods, targeted matrices and units of measure should have been, to some extent, standardised between publications to ease comparison and cross checking. Data on honey bee exposure to pesticides would have also benefit from the use of commercial formulations in experiments instead of active ingredients, with a special assessment of co-formulants (quantitative exposure and effects). Finally, the air matrix within the colony must be explored in order to complete current knowledge on honey bee pesticide exposure. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Inducible versus constitutive social immunity: Examining effects of colony infection on glucose oxidase and defensin-1 production in honeybees	Honeybees use a variety of defence mechanisms to reduce disease infection and spread throughout the colony. Many of these defences rely on the collective action of multiple individuals to prevent, reduce or eradicate pathogens—often referred to as ‘social immunity’. Glucose oxidase (GOX) and some antimicrobial peptides (e.g. defensin-1 or Def1) are secreted by the hypopharyngeal gland of adult bees on larval food for their antiseptic properties. Because workers secrete these compounds to protect larvae, they have been used as ‘biomarkers’ for social immunity. The aim of this study was to investigate if GOX and Def1 are induced after pathogen exposure to determine whether its production by workers is the result of a collective effort to protect the brood and colony in response to a pathogen challenge. Specifically, we quantified GOX and Def1 in honeybee adults before and after colony-level bacterial infection by American foulbrood ((AFB), Paenibacillus larvae). Overall, our results indicate that levels of GOX and Def1 are not induced in response to pathogenic infections. We therefore conclude that GOX and Def1 are highly constitutive and co-opted as mechanisms of social immunity, and these factors should be considered when investigating immunity at the individual and colony level in social insects. © 2017 The Authors.			2017-05-31
Spring mortality in honey bees in northeastern Italy: detection of pesticides and viruses in dead honey bees and other matrices	In spring there is often a rise in honey bee mortality incidents. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential correlation, in the reported incidents, between exposure to pesticide treatments and virus infections. Here we summarize the situation in northeastern Italy during spring 2014, evaluated by monitoring 150 active ingredients and three honey bee viruses in dead honey bees and other matrices. At least one active ingredient was found in 72.2% of the 79 dead honey bee samples, with the most abundant (59.4%) being insecticides, mainly belonging to the class of neonicotinoids (41.8%), followed by fungicides (40.6%). Imidacloprid, chlorpyrifos, tau-fluvalinate, and cyprodinil were the most frequently detected active ingredients. Multiple virus infections were monitored, revealing a high prevalence of chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) and deformed wing virus (DWV), detected in all samples except one. 71 and 37% of the CBPV- and DWV positive samples, respectively, showed a high number of viral copies per bee (>107). This work emphasizes the possible relationship between spring mortality in honey bees and pesticide treatments. Honey bee viruses could synergistically exacerbate the negative impact of pesticides on honey bee health, endangering the survival of colonies. © 2017 International Bee Research Association.			2017-05-27
Effects of steel foundation wire on elemental content and hygienic removal of honey bee (Apis mellifera) brood	Honey and honey bees are often contaminated with trace metals, some of which are associated with food resources. However, in some cases metal contamination may be coming from within the hive. Based on preliminary observations, we hypothesized that steel foundation wire negatively affects honey bee brood health. To test our hypothesis we quantified the elemental content and measured the removal rates of honey bee brood developing in cells overlapping foundation wires and in control cells adjacent to cells that overlapped foundation wires. We found evidence that brood positioned in cells overlapping the wires contained significantly more iron and was removed at a significantly higher rate compared to control brood. Our study identifies the harmfulness of the common modern beekeeping practice of placing steel wire in beeswax foundation, which if avoided may increase colony population size and improve the health of managed honey bee colonies. © 2017 International Bee Research Association.			2017-05-27
Toxicity of destruxins against the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and its host Apis mellifera	The parasitic mite Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman (Acari: Mesostigmata) is the most challenging honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) pest for beekeepers worldwide. Studies involving the use of entomopathogenic fungi for control of mite populations have shown that there is potential for their use, but there are several obstacles to their direct application in the hive. One of the promising fungi is Metarrhizium anisopliae, which produces toxins involved in pathogenicity named “destruxins” (Dtx). In this study, we performed trials to evaluate the toxicity of crude and purified Dtx (fractions A, B, CE and D) towards V. destructor and A. mellifera. Mortality of mites treated with crude Dtx and Dtx B and CE was higher than control mites in all performed trials, in which several solvents and administration modes were employed. When purified Dtx B and CE were administered to honey bees at the higher concentration they caused a significantly higher mortality compared to control, showing the need for further research. © 2017 International Bee Research Association.			2017-05-27
A novel sensitive luminescence probe microspheres for rapid and efficient detection of τ-Fluvalinate in Taihu Lake	Fluorescent molecularly imprinted polymers have shown great promise in biological or chemical separations and detection, due to their high stability, selectivity and sensitivity. In this work, fluorescent molecularly imprinted microsphere was synthesized via precipitation polymerization, which could separate efficiently and rapidly detect τ-fluvalinate (a toxic insecticide) in water samples, was reported. The fluorescent imprinted sensor showed excellent stability, outstanding selectivity and the limit of detection low to 12.14 nM, good regeneration ability which still kept good sensitivity after 8 cycling experiments and fluorescence quenching mechanism was illustrated in details. In addition, the fluorescent sensor was further used to detect τ-fluvalinate in real samples from Taihu Lake. Despite the relatively complex components of the environment water, the fluorescent imprinted microspheres sitll showed good recovery, clearly demonstrating the potental value of this smart sensor nanomaterial in environment monitoring. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-05-09
Stress-mediated Allee effects can cause the sudden collapse of honey bee colonies	The recent rapid decline in global honey bee populations could have significant implications for ecological systems, economics and food security. No single cause of honey bee collapse has yet to be identified, although pesticides, mites and other pathogens have all been shown to have a sublethal effect. We present a model of a functioning bee hive and introduce external stress to investigate the impact on the regulatory processes of recruitment to the forager class, social inhibition and the laying rate of the queen. The model predicts that constant density-dependent stress acting through an Allee effect on the hive can result in sudden catastrophic switches in dynamical behaviour and the eventual collapse of the hive. The model proposes that around a critical point the hive undergoes a saddle-node bifurcation, and that a small increase in model parameters can have irreversible consequences for the entire hive. We predict that increased stress levels can be counteracted by a higher laying rate of the queen, lower levels of forager recruitment or lower levels of natural mortality of foragers, and that increasing social inhibition can not maintain the colony under high levels of stress. We lay the theoretical foundation for sudden honey bee collapse in order to facilitate further experimental and theoretical consideration. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd		Allee effect, colonial organism, experimental study, foraging behavior, honeybee, inhibition, population dynamics, recruitment (population dynamics), theoretical study, Article, colony collapse, controlled study, disaster, dynamics, egg laying, forager, honeybee, mathematical model, mortality, organism colony, population density, prediction, queen (insect), regulatory mechanism, social aspect, social behavior, statistical parameters, stress, animal, animal behavior, bee, biological model, physiological stress, physiology, reproduction, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, pesticide, Animals, Bees, Behavior, Animal, Colony Collapse, Models, Biological, Pesticides, Reproduction, Stress, Physiological	2017-05-07
Honeybee colony losses in Uruguay during 2013–2014	High rates of honey bee colony losses have been reported worldwide; however, data about colony loss rates in South America is scarce. This study quantified colony losses experienced in Uruguay during the 2013–2014 season and identifies the self-diagnosed causes for these losses. An estimated 2.6% of all Uruguayan beekeepers, who collectively managed 5% of the estimated 550,000 colonies in the country, responded to this survey. We found that total summer and winter losses were similar (summer 19.0% (95% CI 13.26–24.77%), winter 20.2% (95% CI 14.98–25.39)), as were the average operational losses (summer 19.8% (95% CI 14.01–25.52), winter 18.3% (95% CI 13.15–23.56%)). The total annual loss was 28.5% (95% CI 22.42–34.51%), with each beekeeper losing, on average, 28.6% (95% CI 22.52–34.61%) of the colonies in their operation. Loss rates were similar across operations of different sizes. Queen failure, diseases and parasites, and pesticides were the leading self-reported and self-diagnosed causes of colony losses. This study is the first to document honey bee colony losses in Uruguay, establishing a baseline for future long-term monitoring. © 2016, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		colony, honeybee, new record, population decline, population estimation, quantitative analysis, questionnaire survey, season, Uruguay, Apis mellifera	2017-05-01
Risk factors for the presence of Deformed wing virus and Acute bee paralysis virus under temperate and subtropical climate in Argentinian bee colonies	Beekeepers all across the world are suffering important losses of their colonies, and the parasitic mites Varroa destructor and Nosema sp, as well as several bee viruses, are being pointed out as the possible causes of these losses, generally associated with environmental and management factors. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the presence of seven virus species (Deformed wing virus –DWV-, Acute bee paralysis virus –ABPV-, Chronic bee paralysis virus –CBPV-, Black queen cell virus –BQCV-, Kashmir bee virus –KBV-, Israeli acute bee paralysis virus –IAPV-, and Sacbrood bee virus –SBV), as well as the prevalence of Nosema sp. and Varroa destructor, and their possible associated factors, under temperate and subtropical climate conditions in Argentinean colonies. A total of 385 colonies distributed in five Argentinean eco-regions were examined after honey harvest. The final multivariable model revealed only one variable associated with the presence of DWV and two with the presence of ABPV. The apiary random effect was significant in both cases (P = 0.018; P = 0.006, respectively). Colonies with a Varroa infestation rate >3% showed higher presence of DWV than colonies with <3% of Varroa infestation level (OR = 1.91; 95% CI: 1.02–3.57; P < 0.044). The same pattern was observed for the presence of ABPV (OR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.04–4.77; P < 0.039). Also, colonies where replacement of old combs was not a common practice had higher presence of ABPV (OR = 6.02; 95% CI: 1.16–31.25; P < 0.033). Regardless of the location of the colonies, virus presence was strongly associated with V. destructor level. Therefore, all the factors that directly or indirectly influence the levels of mites will be also influencing the presence of the viruses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluating the effects of floral resource specialisation and of nitrogen regulation on the vulnerability of social bees in agricultural landscapes	The abundance and the diversity of bumblebees have been declining for the past decades. While some species remain abundant and widespread, others have experienced vast declines. We tested if diet breadth and exclusiveness of floral resource use affected abundance and land-use response of bumblebees and honeybees in heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. Based on an ecological niche modelling approach, we discovered that three of 13 species (12 Bombus spp. and A. mellifera) responded negatively to land use, while no species responded positively. Overall abundance as well as land-use response of different bee species was unrelated to resource use. The generalist forager B. lapidarius, the slightly more specialised forager B. terrestris/lucorum species complex and the specialist forager B. wurflenii declined most with land use. Moreover, we found that honeybees and two bumblebee species contained higher levels of nitrogen than other non-predatory Hymenoptera and performed almost perfect homeostasis despite variable nitrogen contents of floral resources. We conclude that at least common species of social bees have good nitrogen homeostasis capacity. Generally, our data do not support the notion that species with more specialised floral resource use are more likely to suffer from land use. © 2016, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		abundance, bee, biodiversity, homeostasis, land use planning, pollinator, resource use, specialization, species complex, vulnerability, Apoidea, Bombus lapidarius, Bombus wurflenii, Hymenoptera	2017-05-01

Predictive systems models can help elucidate bee declines driven by multiple combined stressors	Bee declines are driven by multiple combined stresses, making it exceedingly difficult to identify experimentally the most critical threats to bees and their pollination services. We highlight here the too often ignored potential of mechanistic models in identifying critical stress combinations. Advanced bee models are now available as open access tools and offer an unprecedented opportunity for bee biologists to explore bee resilience tipping points in a variety of environmental contexts. We provide general guidelines on how to run bee models to help detect a priori critical stress combinations to be targeted in the field. This so-called funnel analysis should be performed in tight conjunction with the recent development of large-scale field monitoring programs for bee health surveillance. © 2016, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		bee, ecological modeling, environmental stress, guideline, monitoring, pollination, population decline, prediction, Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2017-05-01
ATP-sensitive inwardly rectifying potassium channel modulators alter cardiac function in honey bees	ATP-sensitive inwardly rectifying potassium (KATP) channels couple cellular metabolism to the membrane potential of the cell and play an important role in a variety of tissue types, including the insect dorsal vessel, making them a subject of interest not only for understanding invertebrate physiology, but also as a potential target for novel insecticides. Most of what is known about these ion channels is the result of work performed in mammalian systems, with insect studies being limited to only a few species and physiological systems. The goal of this study was to investigate the role that KATP channels play in regulating cardiac function in a model social insect, the honey bee (Apis mellifera), by examining the effects that modulators of these ion channels have on heart rate. Heart rate decreased in a concentration-dependent manner, relative to controls, with the application of the KATP channel antagonist tolbutamide and KATP channel blockers barium and magnesium, whereas heart rate increased with the application of a low concentration of the KATP channel agonist pinacidil, but decreased at higher concentrations. Furthermore, pretreatment with barium magnified the effects of tolbutamide treatment and eliminated the effects of pinacidil treatment at select concentrations. The data presented here confirm a role for KATP channels in the regulation of honey bee dorsal vessel contractions and provide insight into the underlying physiology that governs the regulation of bee cardiac function. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd		barium, cardiovascular system, cells and cell components, concentration (composition), drug, honeybee, insecticide, ion exchange, magnesium, mammal, membrane, metabolism, phosphate, physiology, potassium, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hexapoda, Invertebrata, Mammalia, adenosine triphosphate, adenosine triphosphate sensitive potassium channel, barium, magnesium, pinacidil, tolbutamide, animal, bee, drug effects, heart, heart rate, metabolism, physiology, Adenosine Triphosphate, Animals, Barium, Bees, Heart, Heart Rate, KATP Channels, Magnesium, Pinacidil, Tolbutamide	2017-05-01
Differential Gene Expression Associated with Honey Bee Grooming Behavior in Response to Varroa Mites	Honey bee (Apis mellifera) grooming behavior is an important mechanism of resistance against the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. This research was conducted to study associations between grooming behavior and the expression of selected immune, neural, detoxification, developmental and health-related genes. Individual bees tested in a laboratory assay for various levels of grooming behavior in response to V. destructor were also analyzed for gene expression. Intense groomers (IG) were most efficient in that they needed significantly less time to start grooming and fewer grooming attempts to successfully remove mites from their bodies than did light groomers (LG). In addition, the relative abundance of the neurexin-1 mRNA, was significantly higher in IG than in LG, no groomers (NG) or control (bees without mite). The abundance of poly U binding factor kd 68 and cytochrome p450 mRNAs were significantly higher in IG than in control bees. The abundance of hymenoptaecin mRNA was significantly higher in IG than in NG, but it was not different from that of control bees. The abundance of vitellogenin mRNA was not changed by grooming activity. However, the abundance of blue cheese mRNA was significantly reduced in IG compared to LG or NG, but not to control bees. Efficient removal of mites by IG correlated with different gene expression patterns in bees. These results suggest that the level of grooming behavior may be related to the expression pattern of vital honey bee genes. Neurexin-1, in particular, might be useful as a bio-marker for behavioral traits in bees. © 2017, The Author(s).		messenger RNA, neurexin, vitellogenin, transcriptome, Article, assay, controlled study, detoxification, gene expression, grooming, honeybee, laboratory, light, nonhuman, Varroa, animal, bee, gene expression, gene expression profiling, genetics, grooming, parasitology, physiology, Varroidae, Animals, Bees, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Profiling, Grooming, Transcriptome, Varroidae	2017-05-01
Honey bee gut microbial communities are robust to the fungicide Pristine® consumed in pollen	Honey bees that consume pollen with sublethal levels of the fungicide Pristine® can have reduced pollen digestion, lower ATP synthesis, and in many ways resemble malnourished bees. Reduced nutrient acquisition in bees exposed to Pristine® might be due to the effects of this fungicide on the composition of gut microbial communities. Two experiments were conducted in two separate years to test for the effects of Pristine® on the composition and diversity of bacteria in nurse bee midguts. In the low-dose experiment, bees fed the fungicide had a reduced relative abundance of Gilliamella sp. and the number of bacterial taxa within each individual bee was lower. In the high-dose experiment, the fungicide treatment led to increased relative abundance of Lactobacillus sp. Firm 4 and Firm 5 relative to the control. Presence of the fungicide did not impact the distribution of bacteria among individuals on either the low-or high-dose experiments. Considerable differences in gut microbial communities existed between the two experiments perhaps due to environmental and dietary factors. The effects of Pristine® on the gut microbiota were inconsistent between experiments indicating that exposure rate and environmental conditions can influence the effects of this fungicide on gut microbial communities. © 2016, The Author(s).		dose-response relationship, fungicide, honeybee, microbial community, nutrient uptake, pollen, relative abundance, respiration, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Bacteria (microorganisms), Lactobacillus sp.	2017-05-01
Chronic exposure of honeybees, Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae), to a pesticide mixture in realistic field exposure rates	Pollen might be contaminated by multiple pesticides representing a risk for long-term contamination of honeybees when collected. Standardized methodology to assess the effects of pesticide mixtures under field conditions is lacking. We conducted an experiment on chronic feeding of a diet contaminated with a field-realistic pesticide mixture on free-flying honeybee colonies. Pesticide residues in larvae and adult tagmata were detected in trace amounts. In colonies treated with a pesticide mixture, larval weight was higher and acini diameters of the hypopharyngeal glands of nurse bees were smaller than in the untreated control. Brood termination and adult lifespan did not differ between both groups. Our study offers a reproducible and applicable approach for testing effects of pesticides on bee health. As feeding of a field-realistic pesticide mixture did not elicit acute bee toxic effects, the described differences might be explained by sub-lethal effects or joint action of single compounds. © 2016, The Author(s).		antifeedant, biological uptake, field method, honeybee, mixing, pesticide application, pesticide residue, pollution exposure, Apidae, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hymenoptera	2017-05-01
A metatranscriptomic survey of the invasive yellow crazy ant, Anoplolepis gracilipes, identifies several potential viral and bacterial pathogens and mutualists	Thriving populations of invasive species often decline, but the mechanisms behind such declines are rarely elucidated. The microbial community living within insects can have significant impacts on host health and population dynamics and may be one such mechanism. Here, we use Illumina RNAseq and 16S amplicon sequencing to compare the bacterial communities, and investigate the presence of viruses, in queens of the invasive yellow crazy ant, Anoplolepis gracilipes, from populations in various stages of decline or expansion in Australia. Black queen cell virus and sequences with homology to the Dicistroviridae family of viruses were detected in queens from declining ant populations. This is the first instance of sequences with homology to a virus being found in A. gracilipes and may indicate a new virus. The overall bacterial communities were not statistically different between the population types and a number of potential mutualists were discovered. Several putative pathogens were also detected, including Candidatus Rhabdochlamydia, the entomopathogen Serratia marcescens and the reproductive parasite Candidatus Cardinium. These taxa are known to significantly affect host biology in other organisms. Our survey has identified several candidates that may be responsible for population declines of this invasive ant, and therefore may have potential as biological control agents. © 2016, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).		ant, bacterium, biological control, genetic analysis, invasive species, microbial community, mutualism, parasite, pathogen, population decline, virus, Australia, Anoplolepis gracilipes, Bacteria (microorganisms), Black queen cell virus, Candidatus Cardinium, Dicistroviridae, Hexapoda, Paratrechina longicornis, Rhabdochlamydia, Serratia marcescens	2017-05-01
Ingestion of Bt rice pollen does not reduce the survival or hypopharyngeal gland development of Apis mellifera adults	Because of its ecological and economic importance, the honey bee Apis mellifera is commonly used to assess the environmental risk of insect-resistant, genetically modified plants. In the present study, feeding-exposure experiments were used to determine whether pollen from transgenic rice harms A. mellifera worker bees. In 1 experiment, the survival and mean acinus diameter of hypopharyngeal glands of adult bees were similar when bees were fed on pollen from Bt rice lines or from a non-Bt rice line, but bee survival was significantly reduced when they received pollen that was mixed with potassium arsenate as a positive control. In a second experiment, bee survival and hypopharyngeal gland development were not reduced when adult bees were fed on non-Bt pollen and a sucrose solution supplemented with Cry2A at 400 µg/g, Cry1C at 50 µg/g, or bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 400 µg/g, but bee survival and hypopharyngeal gland development were reduced when the diet was supplemented with soybean trypsin inhibitor as a positive control. In both experiments, the uptake of Cry proteins by adult bees was confirmed. Overall, the results indicate that the planting of Bt rice lines expressing Cry2A or Cry1C protein poses a negligible risk to A. mellifera worker bees.

The combined effects of a monotonous diet and exposure to thiamethoxam on the performance of bumblebee micro-colonies	There is a pressing need to better understand the factors contributing to declines of wild pollinators such as bumblebees. Many different contributors have been postulated including: loss of flower-rich habitats and nesting sites; monotonous diets; impacts of invasive pathogens; exposure to pesticides such as neonicotinoids. Past research has tended to investigate the impacts of these stressors in isolation, despite the increasing recognition that bees are simultaneously exposed to a combination of stressors, with potentially additive or synergistic effects. No studies to date have investigated the combined effects of a monotonous diet and exposure to pesticides. Using queenless micro-colonies of Bombus terrestris audax, we examined this interaction by providing bees with monofloral or polyfloral pollen that was either contaminated with field-realistic levels of thiamethoxam, a commonly used neonicotinoid, or not contaminated. Both treatments were found to have a significant effect on various parameters relating to micro-colony performance. Specifically, both pesticide-treated micro-colonies and those fed monofloral pollen grew more slowly than those given polyfloral pollen or pollen without pesticides. The two factors appeared to act additively. Micro-colonies given monofloral pollens also exhibited lower reproductive efforts and produced smaller drones. Although further research is needed to examine whether similar effects are found in whole colonies, these findings increase our understanding of the likely effects of multiple stressors associated with agricultural intensification on bee declines. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.		thiamethoxam, insecticide, nitro derivative, oxazine derivative, thiamethoxam, thiazole derivative, agricultural intensification, bee, colony, diet, nest site, pollination, pollinator, pollution effect, pollution exposure, animal experiment, animal food, animal health, Article, Bombus terrestris, controlled study, diet, exposure, food contamination, food quality, growth rate, male, monofloral pollen, monotonous diet, mortality, nonhuman, organism colony, pollen, polyfloral pollen, reproductive success, weight reduction, worker (insect), adverse effects, animal, bee, chemistry, colony collapse, diet, drug effects, female, growth, development and aging, physiological stress, reproduction, Apoidea, Bombus terrestris, Animals, Bees, Colony Collapse, Diet, Female, Insecticides, Male, Nitro Compounds, Oxazines, Pollen, Reproduction, Stress, Physiological, Thiazoles	2017-05-01
Characterization of Nosema ceranae Genetic Variants from Different Geographic Origins	In recent years, large-scale colony losses of honey bees (Apis mellifera) have been reported and the infection with the microsporidia Nosema ceranae has been involved. However, the effect of N. ceranae at the colony level and its role in colony losses vary in different geographic areas. This difference may be related to the presence of multiple N. ceranae genetic variants resulting in different biological consequences. In this study, we analyzed the genetic diversity of 75 N. ceranae samples obtained from 13 countries and Hawaii through inter-sequence single repetition (ISSR) and evaluated if two of these genetic variants triggered different immune responses when infecting Apis mellifera iberiensis. The genetic diversity analysis showed that 41% of the samples had the same DNA amplification pattern, including samples from most European countries except Spain, while the remaining samples showed high variability. Infection assays were performed to analyze the infection levels and the immune response of bees infected with N. ceranae from Spain and Uruguay. The infected bees presented similar infection levels, and both isolates downregulated the expression of abaecin, confirming the ability of the microsporidia to depress the immune response. Only N. ceranae from Uruguay downregulated the expression level of imd compared to control bees. On the other hand, both genetic variants triggered different expression levels of lysozyme. As imd and lysozyme play important roles in the response to pathogens, these results could reflect differences in the biological consequences of N. ceranae variants in A. mellifera infection. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.		abaecin protein, Apis mellifera, antimicrobial cationic peptide, fungal DNA, fungal RNA, insect protein, lysozyme, animal, animal disease, bee, chemistry, classification, down regulation, fungal gene, gene expression regulation, genetic variation, genetics, geography, immunology, metabolism, microbiology, microsporidiosis, Nosema, pathogenicity, procedures, real time polymerase chain reaction, veterinary, Animal Diseases, Animals, Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides, Bees, DNA, Fungal, Down-Regulation, Gene Expression Regulation, Genes, Fungal, Genetic Variation, Geography, Insect Proteins, Microsporidiosis, Muramidase, Nosema, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, RNA, Fungal	2017-05-01
High pesticide risk to honey bees despite low focal crop pollen collection during pollination of a mass blooming crop	Honey bees provide critical pollination services for many agricultural crops. While the contribution of pesticides to current hive loss rates is debated, remarkably little is known regarding the magnitude of risk to bees and mechanisms of exposure during pollination. Here, we show that pesticide risk in recently accumulated beebread was above regulatory agency levels of concern for acute or chronic exposure at 5 and 22 of the 30 apple orchards, respectively, where we placed 120 experimental hives. Landscape context strongly predicted focal crop pollen foraging and total pesticide residues, which were dominated by fungicides. Yet focal crop pollen foraging was a poor predictor of pesticide risk, which was driven primarily by insecticides. Instead, risk was positively related to diversity of non-focal crop pollen sources. Furthermore, over 60% of pesticide risk was attributed to pesticides that were not sprayed during the apple bloom period. These results suggest the majority of pesticide risk to honey bees providing pollination services came from residues in non-focal crop pollen, likely contaminated wildflowers or other sources. We suggest a greater understanding of the specific mechanisms of non-focal crop pesticide exposure is essential for minimizing risk to bees and improving the sustainability of grower pest management programs. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-04-19
Weight of evidence evaluation of a network of adverse outcome pathways linking activation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in honey bees to colony death	Ongoing honey bee (Apis mellifera) colony losses are of significant international concern because of the essential role these insects play in pollinating crops. Both chemical and non-chemical stressors have been implicated as possible contributors to colony failure; however, the potential role(s) of commonly-used neonicotinoid insecticides has emerged as particularly concerning. Neonicotinoids act on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the central nervous system to eliminate pest insects. However, mounting evidence indicates that neonicotinoids also may adversely affect beneficial pollinators, such as the honey bee, via impairments on learning and memory, and ultimately foraging success. The specific mechanisms linking activation of the nAChR to adverse effects on learning and memory are uncertain. Additionally, clear connections between observed impacts on individual bees and colony level effects are lacking. The objective of this review was to develop adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) as a means to evaluate the biological plausibility and empirical evidence supporting (or refuting) the linkage between activation of the physiological target site, the nAChR, and colony level consequences. Potential for exposure was not a consideration in AOP development and therefore this effort should not be considered a risk assessment. Nonetheless, development of the AOPs described herein has led to the identification of research gaps which, for example, may be of high priority in understanding how perturbation of pathways involved in neurotransmission can adversely affect normal colony functions, causing colony instability and subsequent bee population failure. A putative AOP network was developed, laying the foundation for further insights as to the role of combined chemical and non-chemical stressors in impacting bee populations. Insights gained from the AOP network assembly, which more realistically represents multi-stressor impacts on honey bee colonies, are promising toward understanding common sensitive nodes in key biological pathways and identifying where mitigation strategies may be focused to reduce colony losses. © 2017		Chemical activation, Networks (circuits), Risk assessment, Tobacco, Adverse outcomes, Biological pathways, Central nervous systems, Honey bee, Neonicotinoid insecticides, Neonicotinoids, Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), Food products, adenylate cyclase, calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase II, calmodulin, cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase, cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein, mitogen activated protein kinase, neonicotinoid, nicotinic receptor, colony structure, honeybee, neonicotinoid pesticide, nervous system, physiology, pollinator, protein, Apis mellifera, death, desensitization, environmental exposure, environmental impact assessment, environmental monitoring, enzyme inhibition, foraging, human, learning, memory, mitochondrion, nonhuman, organism colony, Review, signal transduction, thermoregulation, transcription initiation, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hexapoda	2017-04-15
Protocols for investigating the host-tissue distribution, transmission-mode, and effect on the host fitness of a densovirus in the cotton bollworm	Many novel viruses have been discovered in animal hosts using next-generation sequencing technologies. Previously, we reported a mutualistic virus, Helicoverpa armigera densovirus (HaDV2), in a lepidopteran species, the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner). Here, we describe the protocols that are currently used to study the effect of HaDV2 on its host. First, we establish a HaDV2-free cotton bollworm colony from a single breeding pair. Then, we orally inoculate some neonate larval offspring with HaDV2-containing filtered liquid to produce two colonies with the same genetic background:one HaDV2-infected, the other uninfected. A protocol to compare life table parameters (e.g., larval, pupal, and adult periods and fecundity) between the HaDV2-infected and -uninfected individuals is also presented, as are the protocols for determining the host-tissue distribution and transmission efficiency of HaDV2. These protocols would also be suitable for investigating the effects of other orally transmitted viruses on their insect hosts, lepidopteran hosts in particular. © 2017 Journal of Visualized Experiments.		animal, Densovirinae, genetics, host pathogen interaction, larva, moth, physiology, pupa, virology, Animals, Densovirus, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Larva, Moths, Pupa	2017-04-12
Evaluating the effect of environmental chemicals on honey bee development from the individual to colony level	The presence of pesticides in the beekeeping environment is one of the most serious problems that impacts the life of a honey bee. Pesticides can be brought back to the beehive after the bees have foraged on flowers that have been sprayed with pesticides. Pesticide contaminated food can be exchanged between workers which then feed larvae and therefore can potentially affect the development of honey bees. Thus, residual pesticides in the environment can become a chronic damaging factor to honey bee populations and gradually lead to colony collapse. In the presented protocol, honey bee feeding methods are described and applied to either an individual honey bee or to a colony. Here, the insect growth regulator (IGR) pyriproxyfen (PPN), which is widely used to control pest insects and is harmful to the development of honey bee larvae and pupae, is used as the pesticide. The presenting procedure can be applied to other potentially harmful chemicals or honeybee pathogens for further studies. © 2017 Journal of Visualized Experiments.		pesticide, pyridine derivative, pyriproxyfen, animal, bee, drug effects, growth, development and aging, larva, pollutant, toxicity, Animals, Bees, Environmental Pollutants, Larva, Pesticides, Pyridines	2017-04-01
Pesticide residues in propolis from Spain and Chile. An approach using near infrared spectroscopy	This study analyses the presence of pesticides in 106 samples of raw propolis from Spain and Chile. The components detected and quantified using gas chromatography mass spectrometry were as follows: triamidefon present in 70.1% of the samples with concentrations between 0.35 and 42.17 mg/kg, and dicofol detected in 7.5% of the samples with concentrations between 0.39 and 2.83 mg/kg. Diclorofluanid, procymidone, folpet, propham and metazachlor were also detected but only in a small number of samples. Near infrared spectroscopy with a remote reflectance fibre-optic probe was used to detect samples contaminated with triadimefon via partial least squares discriminant, with a R2 value of 0.71. In addition, the presence of the pesticide triadimefon in propolis was quantified using the modified partial least squares (MPLS) regression method. The calibration results showed a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.81, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.36, and a ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) of 2.5. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A feeding protocol for delivery of agents to assess development in Varroa mites	A novel feeding protocol for delivery of bio-active agents to Varroa mites was developed by providing mites with honey bee larva hemolymph supplemented with cultured insect cells and selected materials delivered on a fibrous cotton substrate. Mites were starved, fed on treated hemolymph to deliver selected agents and then returned to bee larvae. Transcript levels of two reference genes, actin and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), as well as for nine selected genes involved in reproductive processes showed that the starvation and feeding protocol periods did not pose a high level of stress to the mites as transcript levels remained comparable between phoretic mites and those completing the protocol. The feeding protocol was used to deliver molecules such as hormone analogs or plasmids. Mites fed with Tebufenozide, an ecdysone analog, had higher transcript levels of shade than untreated or solvent treated mites. In order to extend this feeding protocol, cultured insect cells were incorporated to a final ratio of 1 part cells and 2 parts hemolymph. Although supplementation with Bombyx mori Bm5 cells increased the amount of hemolymph consumed per mite, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of mites that fed and survived. On the other hand, Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells reduced significantly the percentage of mites that fed and survived as well as the amount of hemolymph consumed. The feeding protocol provides a dynamic platform with which to challenge the Varroa mite to establish efficacy of control agents for this devastating honey bee pest.		actin, glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase, hormone analog, lipid transfer protein, tebufenozide, drug carrier, fluorescent dye, hydrazine derivative, insecticide, Article, Bombyx mori, cell line, controlled study, DNA extraction, Drosophila melanogaster, dynamics, feeding, hemolymph, honeybee, nonhuman, real time polymerase chain reaction, RNA isolation, validation study, Varroa, analysis, animal, animal food, bee, chemistry, cytology, drug effects, genetics, growth, development and aging, larva, metabolism, parasitology, tick control, toxicity, Varroidae, Animal Feed, Animals, Bees, Cell Line, Drosophila melanogaster, Drug Carriers, Fluorescent Dyes, Hemolymph, Hydrazines, Insecticides, Larva, Tick Control, Varroidae	2017-04-01
Early life stress affects mortality rate more than social behavior, gene expression or oxidative damage in honey bee workers	Early life stressors can affect aging and life expectancy in positive or negative ways. Individuals can adjust their behavior and molecular physiology based on early life experiences but relatively few studies have connected such mechanisms to demographic patterns in social organisms. Sociality buffers individuals from environmental influences and it is unclear how much early life stress affects later life history. Workers of the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) were exposed to two stressors, Varroa parasitism and Paraquat exposure, early in life. Consequences were measured at the molecular, behavioral, and demographic level. While treatments did not significantly affect levels of oxidative damage, expression of select genes, and titers of the common deformed wing virus, most of these measures were affected by age. Some of the age effects, such as declining levels of deformed wing virus and oxidative damage, were opposite to our predictions but may be explained by demographic selection. Further analyses suggested some influences of worker behavior on mortality and indicated weak treatment effects on behavior. The latter effects were inconsistent among the two experiments. However, mortality rate was consistently reduced by Varroa mite stress during development. Thus, mortality was more responsive to early life stress than our other response variables. The lack of treatment effects on these measures may be due to the social organization of honey bees that buffers the individual from the impact of stressful developmental conditions. ï¿½ 2017 Elsevier Inc.		paraquat, herbicide, age, animal tissue, Article, Common deformed wing virus, controlled study, early life stress, gene expression, honeybee, insect virus, mortality, nonhuman, oxidative stress, prediction, social behavior, Varroa destructor, worker (insect), animal, bee, environmental exposure, genetics, life cycle stage, longevity, mite, parasitology, physiology, statistical model, Animals, Bees, Environmental Exposure, Gene Expression, Herbicides, Life Cycle Stages, Logistic Models, Longevity, Mites, Oxidative Stress, Paraquat, Social Behavior	2017-04-01
Honey bees preferentially consume freshlystored Pollen	Honey bees (Apis mellifera) collect and store both honey and pollen in preserved forms. Pollen storage involves the addition of honey or nectar and oral secretions to pollen granules. It is controversial whether the duration of pollen storage alters the palatability or nutritive value of the pollen storage medium. We examined how bees utilize different-Aged stored pollen during an extended pollen flow. The deposition of pollen into wax cells and subsequent consumption were monitored daily on 18 brood frames from 6 colonies over an 8d observation period. Despite a greater abundance of older stored pollen cells on brood frames, bees showed a marked preference for the consumption of freshly-stored pollen. Two to four dayold pollen cell contents were significantly more likely to be consumed, while pollen cell contents more than seven days old were eaten at much lower rates. Similar experiments that controlled for cell abundance and spatial effects using cage assays yielded the same result. One day-old stored pollen was consumed approximately three times more often than 10dold stored pollen, and two times more often than 5d-old stored pollen. These consumption preferences for freshly-stored pollen occurred despite a lack of clear developmental advantages. Young adult workers reared for 7 days on 1d-, 5d-, or 10d-old stored pollen showed no difference in body mass, stored pollen consumption, hindgut fecal material accumulation, or hypopharyngeal gland (HPG) protein titers, suggesting that different-Aged pollen stores did not vary in their nutritional value to adult bees. These findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis promoting a period of microbially-mediated, beebread maturation that results in greater palatability or nutritive value for aged pollen stores. Rather, stored pollen that is not eaten in the first few days accumulates as excess stores preserved in a less preferred, but nutritionally-similar state.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.		adult, controlled study, honeybee, human, human experiment, hypopharynx, licence, maturation, nonhuman, nutritional value, palatability, reproduction, worker, young adult, animal, bee, feeding behavior, physiology, pollen, Animals, Bees, Feeding Behavior, Pollen	2017-04-01
Changes in the Bacteriome of Honey Bees Associated with the Parasite Varroa destructor, and Pathogens Nosema and Lotmaria passim	The honey bee, Apis mellifera, is a globally important species that suffers from a variety of pathogens and parasites. These parasites and pathogens may have sublethal effects on their bee hosts via an array of mechanisms, including through a change in symbiotic bacterial taxa. Our aim was to assess the influence of four globally widespread parasites and pathogens on the honey bee bacteriome. We examined the effects of the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor, the fungal pathogens Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae, and the trypanosome Lotmaria passim. Varroa was detected by acaricidal treatment, Nosema and L. passim by PCR, and the bacteriome using MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Overall, the 1,858,850 obtained sequences formed 86 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 3 % dissimilarity. Location, time of year, and degree of infestation by Varroa had significant effects on the composition of the bacteriome of honey bee workers. Based on statistical correlations, we found varroosis more important factor than N. ceranae, N. apis, and L. passim infestation influencing the honey bee bacteriome and contributing to the changes in the composition of the bacterial community in adult bees. At the population level, Varroa appeared to modify 20 OTUs. In the colonies with high Varroa infestation levels (varroosis), the relative abundance of the bacteria Bartonella apis and Lactobacillus apis decreased. In contrast, an increase in relative abundance was observed for several taxa including Lactobacillus helsingborgensis, Lactobacillus mellis, Commensalibacter intestini, and Snodgrassella alvi. The results showed that the “normal” bacterial community is altered by eukaryotic parasites as well as displaying temporal changes and changes associated with the geographical origin of the beehive. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

De novo transcriptome assembly for apis cerana cerana larval gut and identification of SSR molecular markers	[Objective]: The objective of this study is to de novo assemble a reference transcriptome for Apis cerana cerana larval gut, perform gene function and pathway annotation for this transcriptome, and to identify specific SSR molecular markers for A. c. cerana larvae. [Method]: 3-day-old instar A c. cerana larvae were fed with the purified Ascosphaera apis spores, the guts of 4-, 5- or 6-day-old honeybee larvae were sampled and used as sequencing material for RNA seq. After filtration, clean reads were obtained, and unigenes were assembled using Trinity software. BLASTX tool (E-value<10-5) was used to search the unigenes against NCBI Nr, Swiss-Prot protein, KOG as well as KEGG databases to perform gene function and pathway annotation. MSA software was used to search microsatellite markers in the larval gut's transcriptome. The specific primers of all SSRs were designed using Primer Premier 5 program and several pairs were used to amplify SSR loci in A. c. cerana larvae samples from 3 different regions (Beijing, Xingcheng, and Chengdu) in China by method of PCR. [Result]: In this study, RNA seq produced 35 670 000 high quality reads, which were assembled into 43 557 unigenes with a mean length of 898 nt. 18 225 unigenes were annotated in the public protein databases. A total of 11 442 unigenes had a KOG classification and they distributed in 25 KOG categories, among them, RNA processing and modification was the largest group (1 249). 9 679 unigenes could be classified into three gene ontology (GO) categories, in which the mostly enriched ones were cellular process (4 201 unigenes), cell (2 900 unigenes) and binding (4 935 unigenes). 4 517 unigenes were annotated to 216 KEGG pathways, among them, ribosome (385 unigenes) was the largest. Finally, 13 448 SSRs were found in 7 763 unigenes, and 6 out 20 SSR loci could be successfully amplified in A c. cerana larvae samples from 3 different regions in China using PCR. [Conclusion]: This study assembled and annotated a reference transcriptome for A. c. cerana larval gut, which will provide a key information not only to studies on eastern honeybee and its larvae such as molecular biology and omics, but also to improve and validate the genome of A cerana. SSR markers developed here could be applied to future investigation of A c. cerana including gene map construction, genetic diversity analysis as well as gene location. Meanwhile, this study suggested that developing molecular markers using transcriptome data of non-model organism is a rapid and efficient method.		biomarker, genetic analysis, genome, honeybee, identification method, larval development, molecular analysis, RNA, Beijing [China], Chengdu, China, Liaoning, Sichuan, Xingcheng	2017-03-16
Potential supply of floral resources to managed honey bees in natural mistbelt forests	Honey bees play a vital role in the pollination of flowers in many agricultural systems, while providing honey through well managed beekeeping activities. Managed honey bees rely on the provision of pollen and nectar for their survival and productivity. Using data from field plot inventories in natural mistbelt forests, we (1) assessed the diversity and relative importance of honey bee plants, (2) explored the temporal availability of honey bee forage (nectar and pollen resources), and (3) elucidated how plant diversity (bee plant richness and overall plant richness) influenced the amount of forage available (production). A forage value index was defined on the basis of species-specific nectar and pollen values, and expected flowering period. Up to 50% of the overall woody plant richness were found to be honey bee plant species, with varying flowering period. As expected, bee plant richness increased with overall plant richness. Interestingly, bee plants’ flowering period was spread widely over a year, although the highest potential of forage supply was observed during the last quarter. We also found that only few honey bee plant species contributed 90 percent of the available forage. Surprisingly, overall plant richness did not significantly influence the bee forage value. Rather, bee plant species richness showed significant and greater effect. The results of this study suggest that mistbelt forests can contribute to increase the spatial and temporal availability of diverse floral resources for managed honey bees. Conservation efforts must be specifically oriented towards honey bee plant species in mistbelt forests to preserve and enhance their potential to help maintain honey bee colonies. The implications for forest management, beekeeping activities and pollination-based agriculture were discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd		apiculture, flora, flowering, forage, forest ecosystem, forest management, honeybee, nectar, pollen, pollination, resource availability, spatiotemporal analysis, species diversity, species richness, woody plant, apiculture, flower development, forage, forest management, honeybee, nectar, nonhuman, pollination, South Africa, species richness, woody plant, agriculture, animal, bee, biodiversity, flower, forest, pollen, South Africa, South Africa, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Agriculture, Animals, Bees, Biodiversity, Flowers, Forests, Pollen, Pollination, South Africa	2017-03-15
Bee++: An object-oriented, agent-based simulator for honey bee colonies	We present a model and associated simulation package (www.beeplusplus.ca) to capture the natural dynamics of a honey bee colony in a spatially-explicit landscape, with temporally-variable, weather-dependent parameters. The simulation tracks bees of different ages and castes, food stores within the colony, pollen and nectar sources and the spatial position of individual foragers outside the hive. We track explicitly the intake of pesticides in individual bees and their ability to metabolize these toxins, such that the impact of sub-lethal doses of pesticides can be explored. Moreover, pathogen populations (in particular, Nosema apis, Nosema cerenae and Varroa mites) have been included in the model and may be introduced at any time or location. The ability to study interactions among pesticides, climate, biodiversity and pathogens in this predictive framework should prove useful to a wide range of researchers studying honey bee populations. To this end, the simulation package is written in open source, object-oriented code (C++) and can be easily modified by the user. Here, we demonstrate the use of the model by exploring the effects of sub-lethal pesticide exposure on the flight behaviour of foragers. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.			2017-03-10

Honey bee (Apis mellifera) health in stationary and migratory apiaries	The practice of migratory beekeeping is based on moving honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies between different locations to intensify agricultural production through improved pollination services. However, due to stress caused by exposure of bee hives to different environments, migratory beekeeping activities can lead colonies to greater susceptibility of these insects to pathogens and pests, thus leading to population decline and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the health profile of apiaries that adopt two types of management (stationary and migratory), located in the central-eastern region of São Paulo state, Brazil, during two sampling periods, one in spring (October 2010), and one in autumn (May 2011). We collected 474 samples of honeycomb from the brood area, combs containing capped brood, adult bees that covered the brood area, and foraging bees, to evaluate the presence and prevalence of Paenibacillus larvae, Varroa destructor, Nosema apis and N. ceranae. Seasonality was identified as a determining factor in the health condition of Africanized A. mellifera colonies, causing a stronger effect on health than the type of management employed (stationary vs migratory beekeeping). The infection rates of N. ceranae were higher during the autumn in relation to the spring (387 ± 554 spores per bee in the spring and 1,167 ± 1,202 spores per bee in the autumn in stationary apiaries and 361 ± 687 spores per bee in the spring and 1,082 ± 1,277 spores per bee in the autumn in migratory apiaries). The same pattern was found for infestation rates of V. destructor (2.83 ± 1.97 in the spring and 9.48 ± 6.15 in the autumn in stationary apiaries and 3.25 ± 2.32 in the spring and 6.34 ± 6.58 in the autumn in migratory apiaries). These results demonstrate that the seasonality affects the health of A. mellifera colonies, but it does not depend on the type of management adopted (stationary or migratory).			2017-03-01
Rates of single and multiple virus infection in the honey bee, Apis mellifera	Colony collapse disorder has increased interest in the role of viruses in honey bee health. In this study, we determine if management practices affect the rates of infection for six common viruses by comparing the rates of infection between migratory, queen breeder, and hobbyist beekeepers. The study found that migratory beekeepers had higher rates of infection for Israeli acute paralysis virus and Kashmir bee virus. Migratory beekeepers also had higher rates of infection by more than one virus within a single colony. These results highlight the importance of management practices, perhaps including housing bees at high density, for the prevention of viral infection.			2017-03-01
A pan-European epidemiological study reveals honey bee colony survival depends on beekeeper education and disease control	Reports of honey bee population decline has spurred many national efforts to understand the extent of the problem and to identify causative or associated factors. However, our collective understanding of the factors has been hampered by a lack of joined up trans-national effort. Moreover, the impacts of beekeeper knowledge and beekeeping management practices have often been overlooked, despite honey bees being a managed pollinator. Here, we established a standardised active monitoring network for 5 798 apiaries over two consecutive years to quantify honey bee colony mortality across 17 European countries. Our data demonstrate that overwinter losses ranged between 2% and 32%, and that high summer losses were likely to follow high winter losses. Multivariate Poisson regression models revealed that hobbyist beekeepers with small apiaries and little experience in beekeeping had double the winter mortality rate when compared to professional beekeepers. Furthermore, honey bees kept by professional beekeepers never showed signs of disease, unlike apiaries from hobbyist beekeepers that had symptoms of bacterial infection and heavy Varroa infestation. Our data highlight beekeeper background and apicultural practices as major drivers of honey bee colony losses. The benefits of conducting trans-national monitoring schemes and improving beekeeper training are discussed. © 2017 Jacques et al.

Introduction of Aethina tumida (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) in the regions of Calabria and Sicily (southern Italy)	Aethina tumida (small hive beetle, SHB) was first detected in September 2014 in Calabria region, southern Italy, and in a single apiary in Sicily in November 2014. In September 2015, SHB was again recorded in Calabria, and in 2016, only sentinel honey bee nucleus colonies were found to be infested. Its phylogenetic relationship and possible origin were investigated comparing the cox1 sequences with the corresponding region available in the GenBank database. The neighbour-joining method revealed that the first Italian specimen belonged to a group also containing an African specimen from Cameroon. The Italian specimens differ from the SHBs spread worldwide and are split into two different groups: group B1 includes the AfricCam3 sequence and the first SHB identified in Calabria; group B2 includes specimens from Calabria and the only one from Sicily which share identical cox1 sequences. SHB in Italy appears to have been introduced from Africa and includes independent or contemporary incursions in the two concerned regions. The most likely scenario is that SHB was introduced into Calabria followed by man-mediated migration to Sicily. © 2016, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		biological invasion, database, honeybee, new species, phylogenetics, type specimen, Calabria, Cameroon, Italy, Sicily, Aethina tumida, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Coleoptera, Nitidulidae	2017-03-01
Gauging the Effect of Honey Bee Pollen Collection on Native Bee Communities	Experimental demonstration of direct exploitative competition between foraging honey bees and native bees in wildlands has proven elusive, due to problems of experimental design, scale, and context-dependence. We propose a different approach that translates floral resources collected by a honey bee colony into progeny equivalents of an average solitary bee. Such a metric is needed by public land managers confronting migratory beekeeper demands for insecticide-free, convenient, resource-rich habitats for summering. We calculate that, from June–August, a strong colony gathers as much pollen as could produce 100,000 progeny of an average solitary bee. Analogous to the animal unit month (AUM) for livestock, a hive unit month (HUM) is therefore 33,000 native bee progeny. By this calculation, a 40-hive apiary residing on wildlands for 3 months collects the pollen equivalent of four million wild bees. We introduce a rapid assessment metric to gauge stocking of honey bees, and briefly highlight alternative strategies to provide quality pasture for honey bees with minimal impact on native bees.

Cold ambient temperature promotes Nosema spp. intensity in honey bees (Apis mellifera)	Interactions between parasites and environmental factors have been implicated in the loss of managed Western honey bee (=HB, Apis mellifera) colonies. Although laboratory data suggest that cold temperature may limit the spread of Nosema ceranae, an invasive species and now ubiquitous endoparasite of Western HBs, the impact of weather conditions on the distribution of this microsporidian in the field is poorly understood. Here, we conducted a survey for Nosema spp. using 18 Swiss apiaries (four colonies per apiary) over a period of up to 18 months. Samples consisting of 60 workers were collected monthly from each colony to estimate Nosema spp. intensity, i.e., the number of spores in positive samples using microscopy. Ambient apiary temperature was measured daily to estimate the proportion of days enabling HB flight (>10 ï¿½C at midday). The results show that Nosema spp. intensities were negatively correlated with the proportion of days enabling HB flight, thereby suggesting a significant and unexpected positive impact of cold ambient temperature on intensities, probably via regulation of defecation opportunities for infected hosts. ï¿½ 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.			2017-03-01
Residues of neonicotinoid insecticides in pollen and nectar from model plants	Systemic insecticides used for ornamental horticulture crops can protect all portions of a plant with long-lasting effects. However, they may be hazardous to pollinators foraging on contaminated nectar or pollen. Two model plant cultivars were chosen based upon their ability to produce large quantities of pollen or nectar, enabling examination of the level of nectar or pollen contamination (e.g., insecticide ‘‘residues’’) following insecticide treatments, rather than for the need or advisability to treat these plants in production nurseries or the landscape with systemic insecticides. These plants were sunflower (Helianthus annuus L. ‘Taiyo’) for pollen, and swamp milkweed (Asclepius incarnata L. ‘Ice Ballet’) for nectar. Plants were treated at labeled nursery rates with imidacloprid, dinotefuran, or thiamethoxam via foliar spray or soil drench at various times before bloom. Insecticide residues from pollen and nectar varied based upon application method, insecticide, and rate. Assuming that residues should be considered hazardous when they exceed 25 parts per billion (ppb) for nectar or 100 ppb for pollen, potentially bee-toxic concentrations of insecticide in sunflower pollen only followed high-rate drench treatments. Toxic concentrations of neonicotinoids were found in milkweed nectar when applied either as a drench or as a foliar spray up to six weeks before bloom. Label directions for nursery and greenhouse plants permit very high application rates relative to agronomic crops. These high rates can create hazardous conditions for pollinators, and should be avoided for ornamental crops that are highly attractive to bees. © 2017 Horticultural Research Institute.			2017-03-01
Influence of varroa mite (Varroa destructor) management practices on insecticide sensitivity in the honey bee (Apis mellifera)	Since Varroa mites may cause devastating losses of honey bees through direct feeding, transmitting diseases, and increasing pathogen susceptibility, chemical and mechanical practices commonly are used to reduce mite infestation. While miticide applications are typically the most consistent and efficacious Varroa mite management method, miticide-induced insecticide synergism in honey bees, and the evolution of resistance in Varroa mites are reasonable concerns. We treated colonies with the miticide amitraz (Apivarï¿½), used IPM practices, or left some colonies untreated, and then measured the effect of different levels of mite infestations on the sensitivity of bees to phenothrin, amitraz, and clothianidin. Sensitivity to all insecticides varied throughout the year among and within treatment groups. Clothianidin sensitivity decreased with increasing mite levels, but no such correlation was seen with phenothrin or amitraz. These results show that insecticide sensitivity is dynamic throughout the 5 months test. In-hive amitraz treatment according to the labeled use did not synergize sensitivity to the pesticides tested and this should alleviate concern over potential synergistic effects. Since IPM practices were largely ineffective at reducing Varroa mite infestation, reliance on chemical methods of Varroa mite management is likely to continue. However, miticides must be used judiciously so the long term effectiveness of these compounds can be maximized. These data demonstrate the complex and dynamic variables that contribute to honey bee colony health. The results underscore the importance of controlling for as many of these variables as possible in order to accurately determine the effects of each of these factors as they act alone or in concert with others. ï¿½ 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.			2017-03-01
Gram-Positive Bacteria with Probiotic Potential for the Apis mellifera L. Honey Bee: The Experience in the Northwest of Argentina	Apis mellifera L. is one of the most important natural pollinators of significant crops and flowers around the world. It can be affected by different types of illnesses: american foulbrood, nosemosis, varroasis, viruses, among others. Such infections mainly cause a reduction in honey production and in extreme situations, the death of the colony. Argentina is the world’s second largest honey exporter and the third largest honey producer, after China and Turkey. Given both the prominence of the honey bee in nature and the economic importance of apiculture in Argentina and the world, it is crucial to develop efficient and sustainable strategies to control honey bee diseases and to improve bee colony health. Gram-positive bacteria, such as lactic acid bacteria, mainly Lactobacillus, and Bacillus spp. are promising options. In the Northwest of Argentina, several Lactobacillus and Bacillus strains from the honey bee gut and honey were isolated by our research group and characterized by using in vitro tests. Two strains were selected because of their potential probiotic properties: Lactobacillus johnsonii CRL1647 and Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis Mori2. Under independent trials with both experimental and commercial hives, it was determined that each strain was able to elicit probiotic effects on bee colonies reared in the northwestern region of Argentina. One result was the increase in egg-laying by the queen which therefore produced an increase in bee number and, consequently, a higher honey yield. Moreover, the beneficial bacteria reduced the incidence of two important bee diseases: nosemosis and varroosis. These results are promising and extend the horizon of probiotic bacteria to the insect world, serving beekeepers worldwide as a natural tool that they can administer as is, or combine with other disease-controlling methods. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.		carboxylic acid, lipopeptide, probiotic agent, antimicrobial activity, apiculture, Apis mellifera, Argentina, Bacillus, bacterium isolation, bee sting, beneficial organism, egg laying, flying, honey, intestine flora, Lactobacillus, nonhuman, nosemosis, population size, priority journal, Review, varroosis	2017-03-01
Evaluation of motor changes and toxicity of insecticides Fipronil and imidacloprid in Africanized Honey bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae)	Honey bees are important pollinators and are essential in beekeeping. Honey bees get exposed to systemic pesticides while foraging in contaminated fields, and it is important to know the toxicity (LD50) and evaluate the impacts of bees' exposure to these molecules. Fipronil and imidacloprid are systemic pesticides widely used in Brazil and other countries. The objective of this study was to determine the LD50 (24 hours) and evaluate motor changes in Africanized honey bee foragers exposed to lethal and sublethal doses of fipronil and imidacloprid. To determine the LD50, foraging honey bees were exposed by ingestion and contact to five doses of fipronil (Regent 800WG°) and imidacloprid (Appalus 200SC°) insecticides. After 24 hours of exposure, the number of dead bees was counted, and the results were subjected to probit analysis. The motor activity of bees exposed by ingestion or contact to LD50 and sublethal doses (1/500th of the LD50) of both pesticides was assessed 4 hours after exposure using a behavioral observation box. The ingestion and contact with LD50 of fipronil were 0.0528±0.0090 and 0.0054±0.0041 μg/bee, respectively; the ingestion and contact with LD50 of imidacloprid were 0.0809±0.0135 and 0.0626±0.0080 μg/bee, respectively. Bees exposed to lethal and sublethal doses of both insecticides experienced significant motor alterations compared to the control, except for exposure to sublethal doses of fipronil by contact. Fipronil and imidacloprid are highly toxic and promote motor changes in bees. Thus, it is important to establish management methods to reduce pollinators' exposure to these pesticides.			2017-03-01
Differential gene expressions of innate immune related genes of the Asian honeybee, Apis cerana, latently infected with sacbrood virus	The Asian honeybee, Apis cerana, is a native honeybee species in Korea which is important in agriculture for pollination and honey production. Since 2009, A. cerana in Korea has been endangered because of the outbreak of sacbrood virus (SBV) disease which caused serious colony loss. SBV belongs to the genus Iflavirus, and infects the honeybee larvae specifically to cause larval death. For better understanding of the molecular biological aspects of the viral pathogen and insect host, the A. cerana larvae latently infected with SBV virus (AcSBV) and control (AcCtrl) were subjected to high-throughput transcriptome sequencing to compare the gene expression profiles. 101 base paired-end Illumina sequencing generated a total of 211,850,996 and 231,925,174 clean reads from AcSBV and AcCtrl, corresponding to 17.4 Gb and 18.7 Gb of nucleotides, respectively. An in silico cDNA library was constructed by Trinity de novo assembler and TGICL clustering program to make a reference cDNA library containing 67,750 contigs. The quality-filtered Illumina short reads were mapped to the cDNA library, and the top 20,000 of the most frequently mapped contigs by the Bowtie2 program were subjected to the ImmunoDB database to annotate insect innate immune-related genes. The genes with expression levels which were two fold higher or lower in AcSBV compared to the AcCtrl, overall a total of 20 contigs were identified and annotated to demonstrate that the latent infection of SBV affects expression pattern of innate immune-related genes. ï¿½ 2016 Korean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection Society			2017-03-01
Pollen nutrients better explain bumblebee colony development than pollen diversity	Bumblebees are valuable pollinators of numerous wild and cultivated plants. They can forage on variable pollen resources. As some pollen species lack particular nutrients or have global low nutritional quality, it has been suggested that bumblebees mix their pollen incomes to ensure a global balanced diet. The hypothesis that a mixed pollen diet better supports bumblebee colony development than a single pollen diet has been poorly explored. We compared the impact of mono-, di- and trifloral diets on microcolony development of Bombus terrestris using three pollen resources with different nutrient contents (Cytisus scoparius, Erica sp. and Sorbus aucuparia) as well as their mixes. Nine parameters (e.g. pollen efficacy: total weight of larvae/total weight of pollen collection) were used to compare the microcolony performances. Moreover, we measured the influence of the pollen diversity and nutritional composition on relevant parameters. We showed that microcolonies can potentially better develop on mixed pollen diets, but single pollen diet can also be as good as mixed pollen diet. Moreover, the sterol concentration appeared as a key factor to establish the impact of a pollen diet on the bumblebee colony development. This study reveals that diverse pollen diet does not necessary equate with good colony development and supports the importance of selecting floral resources by considering their nutrient contents for bee conservation management. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society			2017-03-01
Neonicotinoids transference from the field to the hive by honey bees: Towards a pesticide residues biomonitor	The beehive as a quantitative monitor of pesticide residues applied over a soybean crop was studied through a semi field experiment of controlled exposure of honey bees to pesticides in macro tunnels. The distribution within exposed beehives of pesticides commonly used in soybean plantation, was assessed. Residue levels of insecticides in soybean leaves, honey bees, wax, honey and pollen were analyzed. The transference from pesticides present in the environment into the beehive was evidenced. The obtained results allow relating pesticide concentrations present in the environment with traces found in foraging bees. Therefore, pesticide transference ratios could be calculated for each detected compound (acetamiprid, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) which showed a linear inverse trend with their 1-octanol/water partition coefficient (Kow). The least transferred pesticide to the hive (acetamiprid) has the highest vapor pressure (Vp). This study gives new insights on the usefulness of monitoring the environment through beehives aiming to evaluate if agroecosystems remain sustainable. It also contributes to generate valuable information for model building aiming to predict environmental quality through beehive's analysis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Proteomic and metabolomic analysis reveals rapid and extensive nicotine detoxification ability in honey bee larvae	Despite potential links between pesticides and bee declines, toxicology information on honey bee larvae (Apis mellifera) is scarce and detoxification mechanisms in this development stage are virtually unknown. Larvae are exposed to natural and synthetic toxins present in pollen and nectar through consumption of brood food. Due to the characteristic intensive brood care displayed by honey bees, which includes progressive feeding throughout larval development, it is generally assumed that larvae rely on adults to detoxify for them and exhibit a diminished detoxification ability. We found the opposite. We examined the proteomic and metabolomic responses of in vitro reared larvae fed nicotine (an alkaloid found in nectar and pollen) to understand how larvae cope on a metabolic level with dietary toxins. Larvae were able to effectively detoxify nicotine through an inducible detoxification mechanism. A coordinated stress response complemented the detoxification processes, and we detected significant enrichment of proteins functioning in energy and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as in development pathways, suggesting that nicotine may promote larval growth. Further exploration of the metabolic fate of nicotine using targeted mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that, as in adult bees, formation of 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl) butanoic acid, the result of 2′C-oxidation of nicotine, is quantitatively the most significant pathway of nicotine metabolism. We provide conclusive evidence that larvae are capable of effectively catabolising a dietary toxin, suggesting that increased larval sensitivity to specific toxins is not due to diminished detoxification abilities. These findings broaden the current understanding of detoxification biochemistry at different organizational levels in the colony, bringing us closer to understanding the capacity of the colony as a superorganism to tolerate and resist toxic compounds, including pesticides, in the environment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd		nicotine, animal, bee, drug effects, drug inactivation, larva, metabolism, metabolome, randomization, Animals, Bees, Inactivation, Metabolic, Larva, Metabolome, Nicotine, Random Allocation	2017-03-01
Inside honeybee hives: Impact of natural propolis on the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor and viruses	Social immunity is a key factor for honeybee health, including behavioral defense strategies such as the collective use of antimicrobial plant resins (propolis). While laboratory data repeatedly show significant propolis effects, field data are scarce, especially at the colony level. Here, we investigated whether propolis, as naturally deposited in the nests, can protect honeybees against ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor and associated viruses, which are currently considered the most serious biological threat to European honeybee subspecies, Apis mellifera, globally. Propolis intake of 10 field colonies was manipulated by either reducing or adding freshly collected propolis. Mite infestations, titers of deformed wing virus (DWV) and sacbrood virus (SBV), resin intake, as well as colony strength were recorded monthly from July to September 2013. We additionally examined the effect of raw propolis volatiles on mite survival in laboratory assays. Our results showed no significant effects of adding or removing propolis on mite survival and infestation levels. However, in relation to V. destructor, DWV titers increased significantly less in colonies with added propolis than in propolis-removed colonies, whereas SBV titers were similar. Colonies with added propolis were also significantly stronger than propolis-removed colonies. These findings indicate that propolis may interfere with the dynamics of V. destructor-transmitted viruses, thereby further emphasizing the importance of propolis for honeybee health. ï¿½ 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.			2017-03-01
Generalist social bees maximize diversity intake in plant species-rich and resource-abundant environments	Numerous studies revealed a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, suggesting that biodiverse environments may not only enhance ecosystem processes, but also benefit individual ecosystem members by, for example, providing a higher diversity of resources. Whether and how the number of available resources affects resource collection and subsequently consumers (e.g., through impacting functions associated with resources) have, however, been little investigated, although a better understanding of this relationship may help explain why the abundance and richness of many animal species typically decline with decreasing plant (resource) diversity. Using a social bee species as model (Tetragonula carbonaria), we investigated how plant species richness-recorded for study sites located in different habitats-and associated resource abundance affected the diversity and functionality (here defined as nutritional content and antimicrobial activity) of resources (i.e., pollen, nectar, and resin) collected by a generalist herbivorous consumer. The diversity of both pollen and resin collected strongly increased with increasing plant/tree species richness, while resource abundance was only positively correlated with resin diversity. These findings suggest that bees maximize resource diversity intake in (resource) diverse habitats. Collecting more diverse resources did, however, not increase their functionality, which appeared to be primarily driven by the surrounding (plant) source community in our study. In generalist herbivores, maximizing resource diversity intake may therefore primarily secure collection of sufficient amounts of resources across the entire foraging season, but it also ensures that the allocated resources meet all functional needs. Decreasing available resource diversity may thus impact consumers primarily by reduced resource abundance, but also by reduced resource functionality, particularly when resources of high functionality (e.g., from specific plant species) become scarce. © 2017 Kaluza et al.			2017-03-01
Draft genome of the honey bee ectoparasitic mite, Tropilaelaps mercedesae, is shaped by the parasitic life history	The number of managed honey bee colonies has considerably decreased in many developed countries in recent years and ectoparasitic mites are considered as major threats to honey bee colonies and health. However, their general biology remains poorly understood. We sequenced the genome of Tropilaelaps mercedesae, the prevalent ectoparasitic mite infesting honey bees in Asia, and predicted 15 190 protein-coding genes that were well supported by the mite transcriptomes and proteomic data. Although amino acid substitutions have been accelerated within the conserved core genes of two mites, T. mercedesae and Metaseiulus occidentalis, T. mercedesae has undergone the least gene family expansion and contraction between the seven arthropods we tested. The number of sensory system genes has been dramatically reduced, but T. mercedesae contains all gene sets required to detoxify xenobiotics. T. mercedesae is closely associated with a symbiotic bacterium (Rickettsiella grylli-like) and Deformed Wing Virus, the most prevalent honey bee virus. T. mercedesae has a very specialized life history and habitat as the ectoparasitic mite strictly depends on the honey bee inside a stable colony. Thus, comparison of the genome and transcriptome sequences with those of a tick and free-living mites has revealed the specific features of the genome shaped by interaction with the honey bee and colony environment. Genome and transcriptome sequences of T. mercedesae, as well as Varroa destructor (another globally prevalent ectoparasitic mite of honey bee), not only provide insights into the mite biology, but may also help to develop measures to control the most serious pests of the honey bee. © The Author 2017.		transcriptome, xenobiotic agent, transcriptome, adult, amino acid substitution, Article, controlled study, deformed wing virus, detoxification, female, gene sequence, genetic association, genome, genome analysis, insect virus, male, Metaseiulus occidentalis, mite, mite infestation, nonhuman, nymph, organism colony, parasite development, phylogenetic tree, priority journal, proteomics, sequence analysis, sex determination process, species habitat, Tropilaelaps mercedesae, Varroa destructor, Acari, animal, antibody specificity, bacterium, bee, biology, gene expression profiling, genetics, genomics, host parasite interaction, life cycle stage, molecular genetics, nucleotide repeat, parasitology, phylogeny, procedures, symbiosis, virus, Acari, Animals, Bacteria, Bees, Computational Biology, Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Genome, Genomics, Host-Parasite Interactions, Life Cycle Stages, Male, Molecular Sequence Annotation, Organ Specificity, Phylogeny, Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid, Symbiosis, Transcriptome, Viruses	2017-03-01
Using DNA metabarcoding to investigate honey bee foraging reveals limited flower use despite high floral availability	Understanding which flowers honey bees (Apis mellifera) use for forage can help us to provide suitable plants for healthy honey bee colonies. Accordingly, honey DNA metabarcoding provides a valuable tool for investigating pollen and nectar collection. We investigated early season (April and May) floral choice by honey bees provided with a very high diversity of flowering plants within the National Botanic Garden of Wales. There was a close correspondence between the phenology of flowering and the detection of plants within the honey. Within the study area there were 437 genera of plants in flower during April and May, but only 11% of these were used. Thirty-nine plant taxa were recorded from three hives but only ten at greater than 1%. All three colonies used the same core set of native or near-native plants, typically found in hedgerows and woodlands. The major plants were supplemented with a range of horticultural species, with more variation in plant choice between the honey bee colonies. We conclude that during the spring, honey bees need access to native hedgerows and woodlands to provide major plants for foraging. Gardens provide supplementary flowers that may increase the nutritional diversity of the honey bee diet. © The Author(s) 2017.			2017-02-16
Impacts of dietary phytochemicals in the presence and absence of pesticides on longevity of honey bees (Apis mellifera)	Because certain flavonols and phenolic acids are found in pollen and nectar of most angiosperms, they are routinely ingested by Apis mellifera, the western honey bee. The flavonol quercetin and the phenolic acid p-coumaric acid are known to upregulate detoxification enzymes in adult bees; their presence or absence in the diet may thus affect the toxicity of ingested pesticides. We conducted a series of longevity assays with one-day-old adult workers to test if dietary phytochemicals enhance longevity and pesticide tolerance. One-day-old bees were maintained on sugar syrup with or without casein (a phytochemical-free protein source) in the presence or absence of quercetin and p-coumaric acid as well as in the presence or absence of two pyrethroid insecticides, bifenthrin and β-cyfluthrin. Dietary quercetin (hazard ratio, HR = 0.82), p-coumaric acid (HR = 0.91) and casein (HR = 0.74) were associated with extended lifespan and the two pyrethroid insecticides, 4 ppm bifenthrin (HR = 9.17) and 0.5 ppm (β -cyfluthrin (HR = 1.34), reduced lifespan. Dietary quercetin enhanced tolerance of both pyrethroids; p-coumaric acid had a similar effect trend, although of reduced magnitude. Casein in the diet appears to eliminate the life-prolonging effect of p-coumaric acid in the absence of quercetin. Collectively, these assays demonstrate that dietary phytochemicals influence honey bee longevity and pesticide stress; substituting sugar syrups for honey or yeast/soy flour patties may thus have hitherto unrecognized impacts on adult bee health. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.			2017-02-14
Basic algorithms for bee hive monitoring and laser-based mite control	The work in progress described in this paper has the objective to implement a beehive monitoring system to monitor essential parameters of a bee hive (such as temperature, sound, weight) and additionally including an image recognition algorithm to observe the degree of infestation with Varroa mites. Mites should be detected at the entrance and statistics about the degree of infestation should be made available by a web interface. As ultimate approach to fight mites without chemicals the coordinates of the mites are to be detected and a laser will be used to kill them. This work describes approaches relevant to all steps of the aforementioned procedure, however it is still work in progress and the components of the approach still have to be integrated into one system that is deployable in practice. © 2016 IEEE.

The Neonicotinoid Insecticide Thiacloprid Impacts upon Bumblebee Colony Development under Field Conditions	The impacts of pesticides, and in particular of neonicotinoids, on bee health remain much debated. Many studies describing negative effects have been criticized as the experimental protocol did not perfectly simulate real-life field scenarios. Here, we placed free-flying bumblebee colonies next to raspberry crops that were either untreated or treated with the neonicotinoid thiacloprid as part of normal farming practice. Colonies were exposed to the raspberry crops for a two week period before being relocated to either a flower-rich or flower-poor site. Overall, exposed colonies were more likely to die prematurely, and those that survived reached a lower final weight and produced 46% fewer reproductives than colonies placed at control farms. The impact was more marked at the flower-rich site (all colonies performed poorly at the flower poor site). Analysis of nectar and pollen stores from bumblebee colonies placed at the same raspberry farms revealed thiacloprid residues of up to 771 ppb in pollen and up to 561 ppb in nectar. The image of thiacloprid as a relatively benign neonicotinoid should now be questioned. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

A comparison of honey bee-collected pollen from working agricultural lands using light microscopy and its metabarcoding	Taxonomic identification of pollen has historically been accomplished via light microscopy but requires specialized knowledge and reference collections, particularly when identification to lower taxonomic levels is necessary. Recently, next-generation sequencing technology has been used as a cost-effective alternative for identifying beecollected pollen; however, this novel approach has not been tested on a spatially or temporally robust number of pollen samples. Here, we compare pollen identification results derived from light microscopy and DNA sequencing techniques with samples collected from honey bee colonies embedded within a gradient of intensive agricultural landscapes in the Northern Great Plains throughout the 2010-2011 growing seasons. We demonstrate that at all taxonomic levels, DNA sequencing was able to discern a greater number of taxa, and was particularly useful for the identification of infrequently detected species. Importantly, substantial phenological overlap did occur for commonly detected taxa using either technique, suggesting that DNA sequencing is an appropriate, and enhancing, substitutive technique for accurately capturing the breadth of bee-collected species of pollen present across agricultural landscapes. We also show that honey bees located in high and low intensity agricultural settings forage on dissimilar plants, though with overlap of the most abundantly collected pollen taxa. We highlight practical applications of utilizing sequencing technology, including addressing ecological issues surrounding land use, climate change, importance of taxa relative to abundance, and evaluating the impact of conservation program habitat enhancement efforts. © The Authors 2016.

Occurrence of pesticide residues in candies containing bee products	Pesticides can be found in bee products as they are usually employed to protect the beehive, but they can also reach the hive due to environmental contamination. These contaminants could be present in processed foods. One of the most common and consumed comfitures based in bee products are honey and propolis candies, for which no analytical method has yet been developed. This work presents the development of an ethyl acetate based extraction method followed by dispersive clean up using Primary and Secondary Amine (PSA) plus Graphitized Carbon Black (GCB) with Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) determination for pesticide residue monitoring candies containing honey and propolis from the Mercosur region. Sixteen pesticides found in bee products as well as three pesticide metabolites of toxicological significance were evaluated including acaricides and insecticides (pyrethroids, organophosphates and some organochlorines). The method was validated, with a LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg for most analyzed pesticides, showing a recovery rate of 70–120% with <20% RSD. Real samples from the Mercosur countries were analyzed. Coumaphos and chlorpyrifos residues were detected in most of them. From these findings a preliminary toxicological evaluation of coumaphos via admissible daily intake (ADI) estimation was conducted. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd			2017-02-01
Mixtures of herbicides and metals affect the redox system of honey bees	The increasing loss of bee colonies in many countries has prompted a surge of studies on the factors affecting bee health. In North America, main crops such as maize and soybean are cultivated with extensive use of pesticides that may affect non-target organisms such as bees. Also, biosolids, used as a soil amendment, represent additional sources of metals in agroecosystems; however, there is no information about how these metals could affect the bees. In previous studies we investigated the effects of environmentally relevant doses of herbicides and metals, each individually, on caged honey bees. The present study aimed at investigating the effects of mixtures of herbicides (glyphosate and atrazine) and metals (cadmium and iron), as these mixtures represent more realistic exposure conditions. Levels of metal, vitamin E, carotenoids, retinaldehyde, at-retinol, retinoic acid isomers (9-cis RA, 13-cis RA, at-RA) and the metabolites 13-cis-4-oxo-RA and at-4-oxo-RA were measured in bees fed for 10 days with contaminated syrup. Mixtures of herbicides and cadmium that did not affect bee viability, lowered bee α- and β-carotenoid contents and increased 9-cis-RA as well as 13-cis-4-oxo-RA without modifying the levels of at-retinol. Bee treatment with either glyphosate, a combination of atrazine and cadmium, or mixtures of herbicides promoted lipid peroxidation. Iron was bioconcentrated in bees and led to high levels of lipid peroxidation. Metals also decreased zeaxanthin bee contents. These results show that mixtures of atrazine, glyphosate, cadmium and iron may affect different reactions occurring in the metabolic pathway of vitamin A in the honey bee. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd		Cadmium, Food products, Iron, Isomers, Lipids, Metals, Mixtures, Oxidation, Oxidative stress, Pigments, Redox reactions, Soils, Weed control, Apis mellifera, Carotenoids, Glyphosates, Lipid peroxidation, Retinoids, Herbicides, 13 cis 4 oxo retinoic acid, alitretinoin, alpha carotenoid, alpha cryptoxanthin, alpha tocopherol, atrazine, beta carotenoid, beta cryptoxanthin, butylcresol, cadmium, carotenoid, glyphosate, iron, isotretinoin, malonaldehyde, retinal, retinoic acid derivative, retinol, unclassified drug, zeaxanthin, atrazine, cadmium, carotenoid, glycine, glyphosate, heavy metal, herbicide, iron, pollutant, agricultural ecosystem, atrazine, bioaccumulation, biosolid, carotenoid, glyphosate, honeybee, lipid, maize, nontarget organism, pesticide application, soil amendment, soybean, trace metal, animal experiment, Article, bioaccumulation, controlled study, environmental exposure, honeybee, lipid peroxidation, nonhuman, oxidation reduction reaction, protein content, vitamin metabolism, analogs and derivatives, animal, bee, drug effects, metabolism, North America, pollutant, toxicity, North America, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Glycine max, Zea mays, Animals, Atrazine, Bees, Cadmium, Carotenoids, Environmental Pollutants, Glycine, Herbicides, Iron, Lipid Peroxidation, Metals, Heavy, North America	2017-02-01
Comparative toxicity of pesticides and environmental contaminants in bees: Are honey bees a useful proxy for wild bee species?	Threats to wild and managed insect pollinators in Europe are cause for both ecological and socio-economic concern. Multiple anthropogenic pressures may be exacerbating pollinator declines. One key pressure is exposure to chemicals including pesticides and other contaminants. Historically the honey bee (Apis mellifera spp.) has been used as an ‘indicator’ species for ‘standard’ ecotoxicological testing but it has been suggested that it is not always a good proxy for other types of eusocial and solitary bees because of species differences in autecology and sensitivity to various stressors. We developed a common toxicity test system to conduct acute and chronic exposures of up to 240 h of similar doses of seven chemicals, targeting different metabolic pathways, on three bee species (Apis mellifera spp., Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis). We compared the relative sensitivity between species in terms of potency between the chemicals and the influence of exposure time on toxicity. While there were significant interspecific differences that varied through time, overall the magnitude of these differences (in terms of treatment effect ratios) was generally comparable (< 2 fold) although there were some large divergences from this pattern. Our results suggest that A. mellifera spp. could be used as a proxy for other bee species provided a reasonable assessment factor is used to cover interspecific variation. Perhaps more importantly our results show significant and large time dependency of toxicity across all three tested species that greatly exceeds species differences (> 25 fold within test). These are rarely considered in standard regulatory testing but may have severe environmental consequences, especially when coupled with the likelihood of differential species exposures in the wild. These insights indicate that further work is required to understand how differences in toxicokinetics vary between species and mixtures of chemicals. ï¿½ 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Stress indicator gene expression profiles, colony dynamics and tissue development of honey bees exposed to sub-lethal doses of imidacloprid in laboratory and field experiments	In this study, different context-dependent effects of imidacloprid exposure on the honey bee response were studied. Honey bees were exposed to different concentrations of imidacloprid during a time period of 40 days. Next to these variables, a laboratory-field comparison was conducted. The influence of the chronic exposure on gene expression levels was determined using an in-house developed microarray targeting different immunity-related and detoxification genes to determine stress-related gene expression changes. Increased levels of the detoxification genes encoding, CYP9Q3 and CYT P450, were detected in imidaclo-prid-exposed honey bees. The different context-dependent effects of imidacloprid exposure on honey bees were confirmed physiologically by decreased hypopharyngeal gland sizes. Honey bees exposed to imidacloprid in laboratory cages showed a general immunosuppression and no detoxification mechanisms were triggered significantly, while honey bees infield showed a resilient response with an immune stimulation at later time points. However, the treated colonies had a brood and population decline tendency after the first brood cycle in the field. In conclusion, this study highlighted the different context-dependent effects of imidacloprid exposure on the honey bee response. These findings warn for possible pitfalls concerning the generalization of results based on specific experiments with short exposure times. The increased levels of CYT P450 and CYP9Q3 combined with an immune response reaction can be used as markers for bees which are exposed to pesticides in the field. ï¿½ 2017 De Smet et al.

Different but the same: bumblebee species collect pollen of different plant sources but similar amino acid profiles	Access to abundant and diverse floral plant sources is essential for generalist bees as they obtain all energy and nutrients required from pollen and nectar. Despite their importance, we still know little about the precise nutritional requirements of most bee species. Here, we investigated differences in floral and amino acid profiles of pollen collected by five bumblebee species in southern Germany, which had access to the same spectrum of plant species and thus sources of nutrition. We found that different bumblebee species visited different floral spectra for pollen collection but nevertheless had highly similar pollen amino acid profiles. This finding suggests that common bumblebee species only slightly differ in their nutritional target for amino acids in pollen. In fact, floral and chemical composition of pollen loads appear to be largely determined by the plant community present at a site as bumblebees attempt to maximize site-specific nutrient collection efficiency. © 2016, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		amino acid, bee, chemical composition, floral trait, generalist, nutrient dynamics, plant community, plant-insect interaction, pollen, resource use, Germany, Apoidea, Hexapoda	2017-02-01
Modelling seasonal effects of temperature and precipitation on honey bee winter mortality in a temperate climate	Insect pollinators are essential to global food production. For this reason, it is alarming that honey bee (Apis mellifera) populations across the world have recently seen increased rates of mortality. These changes in colony mortality are often ascribed to one or more factors including parasites, diseases, pesticides, nutrition, habitat dynamics, weather and/or climate. However, the effect of climate on colony mortality has never been demonstrated. Therefore, in this study, we focus on longer-term weather conditions and/or climate's influence on honey bee winter mortality rates across Austria. Statistical correlations between monthly climate variables and winter mortality rates were investigated. Our results indicate that warmer and drier weather conditions in the preceding year were accompanied by increased winter mortality. We subsequently built a statistical model to predict colony mortality using temperature and precipitation data as predictors. Our model reduces the mean absolute error between predicted and observed colony mortalities by 9% and is statistically significant at the 99.9% confidence level. This is the first study to show clear evidence of a link between climate variability and honey bee winter mortality. © 2016 British Geological Survey, NERC		Climatology, Epidemiology, Food products, Meteorology, Population statistics, Temperature, Weathering, Apis mellifera, Climate variability, Honey bee, Mean absolute error, Precipitation data, Statistical correlation, Statistical modeling, Temperate climate, Climate change, climate change, climate variation, epidemiology, honeybee, mortality, precipitation (climatology), temperature effect, winter, Article, Austria, climate, climate change, environmental temperature, honeybee, model, mortality rate, nonhuman, organism colony, precipitation, priority journal, seasonal variation, statistical model, statistical significance, temperate climate, winter, Austria, Apis mellifera, Hexapoda	2017-02-01
Human welfare and its connection to nature: What have we learned from crop pollination studies?	Human welfare depends on the function of natural systems. This idea is paradigmatic to ecologists and has been the theme of a growing branch of applied ecology. I examine the narrative of human dependence on nature by considering the literature on crop pollination by animals and its importance for food production. Making the connections between human welfare and natural systems is seen as a way to better motivate society to make better decisions, but the debate around crop pollination has been surprisingly contentious. There have been confusing messages, disagreements on the facts, an unfortunate focus on dire projections for the future and a lesser focus on solutions. Most of these problems arise not from poor science but instead from poor communication of complex ideas and differences in perspective, such as the deep disciplinary gap between agricultural scientists and ecologists. By understanding these problems, we can improve the way we do our science and communicate our ideas. I argue that ecologists should continue to communicate the principle that human welfare depends on the function of natural systems and discuss how we can do so in a way that is more genuinely connected to society's needs, such as growing food. If we succeed, we will be changing an intellectually interesting conversation into a dialogue that influences how society interacts with nature. ï¿½ 2016 Ecological Society of Australia		agricultural ecosystem, biodiversity, conservation management, crop plant, decision making, ecosystem function, environmental values, food production, interdisciplinary approach, nature-society relations, pollination, welfare reform, Animalia	2017-02-01
Sublethal pesticide doses negatively affect survival and the cellular responses in American foulbrood-infected honeybee larvae	Disclosing interactions between pesticides and bee infections is of most interest to understand challenges that pollinators are facing and to which extent bee health is compromised. Here, we address the individual and combined effect that three different pesticides (dimethoate, clothianidin and fluvalinate) and an American foulbrood (AFB) infection have on mortality and the cellular immune response of honeybee larvae. We demonstrate for the first time a synergistic interaction when larvae are exposed to sublethal doses of dimethoate or clothianidin in combination with Paenibacillus larvae, the causative agent of AFB. A significantly higher mortality than the expected sum of the effects of each individual stressor was observed in co-exposed larvae, which was in parallel with a drastic reduction of the total and differential hemocyte counts. Our results underline that characterizing the cellular response of larvae to individual and combined stressors allows unmasking previously undetected sublethal effects of pesticides in colony health. © 2017 The Author(s).			2017-02-01
The chemical ecology of host-parasite interaction as a target of Varroa destructor control agents	Honey bees and their ectoparasite Varroa destructor communicate through chemical signals among themselves, but they also eavesdrop on each other’s chemical cues. We summarize semiochemicals of honey bees and Varroa, and their roles in honey bee-Varroa interactions. We also give an overview of current Varroa control methods, which can be classified into three categories: (1) chemical control methods with acaricides, (2) biotechnical intervention, and (3) bee breeding programs. Widely used synthetic chemical acaricides are failing due to the emergence of resistant mites. Therefore, new methods are being sought for Varroa control, and methods that target the semiochemical interactions between bees and mites are among the candidates. We review our discovery of compounds that alter the host choice of Varroa mites (from nurse to forager) in laboratory tests. Any semiochemical-based methods are still in the experimental stage and need validation in the field. © 2016, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		acaricide, biotechnology, chemical control, chemical cue, chemical ecology, ectoparasite, honeybee, honeydew, host-parasite interaction, mite, semiochemical, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2017-02-01
Sublethal exposure to neonicotinoids and related side effects on insect pollinators: honeybees, bumblebees, and solitary bees	Nowadays, there are increasing concerns about the bioavailability of neonicotinoids in the environment and possible exposure of nontarget organisms to these insecticides, their residues having been detected at different concentrations in many matrices, i.e., pollen, nectar, soil, water. Regarding the risk assessment process, there are still some information gaps about the exposure pathways and the possibility of various sublethal effects on insect pollinators. Recently, a clear rapprochement between the sublethal effects of different endpoints under laboratory conditions and field-realistic exposure level has been demonstrated. Here, we attempt to draw general portrayal about the current debate of the exposure to neonicotinoids and their impacts on pollinators. Depending on our extracted data from the published literature, we show that the lowest observed effect concentration under realistic field conditions in the most cases is higher than under laboratory conditions, which indicate that further long-term field research is required with consideration that our good understanding of the pollinators’ responses to sublethal exposure should be taken into account in the future experimental design in order to establish vigorous conclusions. We review currently available information in the published literature, presenting the reports about detected residues in relation to multiple ways of exposure and their potential consequences on insect pollinators and community dynamics. Nevertheless, we attempt to classify the sublethal effects depending on the different biological levels from genes to population. Moreover, we consider the field-realistic exposure level and critically analyze the laboratory as well as field studies to specify their physiological and behavioral effects. Additionally, synergistic effects of different factors, including exposure to neonicotinoids and their hazards on bees, will find special attention. ï¿½ 2016, Deutsche Phythomedizinische Gesellschaft.		bee, bioavailability, ecological impact, experimental design, honeybee, neonicotinoid pesticide, pesticide application, pesticide residue, pollinator, pollution exposure, risk assessment, sublethal effect, Apoidea, Hexapoda	2017-02-01
Genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics: enabling insights into social evolution and disease challenges for managed and wild bees	Globally, there are over 20ï¿½000 bee species (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila) with a host of biologically fascinating characteristics.

Genome sequences of twelve bee species are now complete or under progress, facilitating the application of additional ‘omic technologies. Here, we review recent developments in honey bee and native bee research in the genomic era. We discuss the progress in genome sequencing and functional annotation, followed by the enabled comparative genomics, proteomics and transcriptomics applications regarding social evolution and health.

Regulation of genes related to immune signaling and detoxification in Apis mellifera by an inhibitor of histone deacetylation	The western honeybee (Apis mellifera) is essential for the global economy due to its important role in ecosystems and agriculture as a pollinator of numerous flowering plants and crops. Pesticide abuse has greatly impacted honeybees and caused tremendous loss of honeybee colonies worldwide. The reasons for colony loss remain unclear, but involvement of pesticides and pathogen-pesticide interactions has been hypothesized. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) inhibit the activity of histone acetylase, which causes the hyperacetylation of histone cores and influences gene expression. In this study, sodium butyrate, an HDACi, was used as a dietary supplement for honeybees; after treatment, gene expression profiles were analyzed using quantitative PCR. The results showed that sodium butyrate up-regulated genes involved in anti-pathogen and detoxification pathways. The bioassay results showed that honeybees treated with sodium butyrate were more tolerant to imidacloprid. Additionally, sodium butyrate strengthened the immune response of honeybees to invasions of Nosema ceranae and viral infections. We also performed a bioassay in which honeybees were exposed to pesticides and pathogens. Our results provide additional data regarding the mechanism by which honeybees react to stress and the potential application of HDACis in beekeeping. ï¿½ 2017 The Author(s).			2017-01-23
A visual analytics framework to study honey bee behaviour	We present an end-to-end visual analytics framework that aims to facilitate prediction and decision making about honey bee health based on micro sensing data. The framework is particularly tailored to cope with heterogeneous data from micro sensors and environmental sensors that are deployed to collect information about bees and their environment. The framework design allows for a wide range of end users, including scientists, bee keepers, and decision makers, to effectively explore the bee data through interactive visual interfaces. User centred design is deployed throughout the development to meet the various requirements of the users. A large scale study is being planned to evaluate and further refine the framework based on user experiences. © 2016 IEEE.

Agrochemical synergism imposes higher risk to neotropical bees than to honeybees	Bees are key pollinators whose population numbers are declining, in part, owing to the effects of different stressors such as insecticides and fungicides. We have analysed the susceptibility of the Africanized honeybee, Apis mellifera, and the stingless bee, Partamona helleri, to commercial formulations of the insecticides deltamethrin and imidacloprid. The toxicity of fungicides based on thiophanate-methyl and chlorothalonil were investigated individually and in combination, and with the insecticides. Results showed that stingless bees were more susceptible to insecticides than honeybees. The commercial fungicides thiophanate-methyl or chlorothalonil caused low mortality, regardless of concentration; however, their combination was as toxic as imidacloprid to both species, and over 400-fold more toxic than deltamethrin for A. mellifera. There were highly synergistic effects on mortality caused by interactions in the mixture of imidacloprid and the fungicides thiophanate-methyl, chlorothalonil and the combined fungicide formulation in A. mellifera, and also to a lesser extent in P. helleri. By contrast, mixtures of the deltamethrin and the combined fungicide formulation induced high synergy in P. helleri, but had little effect on the mortality of A. mellifera. Differences in physiology and modes of action of agrochemicals are discussed as key factors underlying the differences in susceptibility to agrochemicals. ï¿½ 2017 The Authors.			2017-01-18
An inert pesticide adjuvant synergizes viral pathogenicity and mortality in honey bee larvae	Honey bees are highly valued for their pollination services in agricultural settings, and recent declines in managed populations have caused concern. Colony losses following a major pollination event in the United States, almond pollination, have been characterized by brood mortality with specific symptoms, followed by eventual colony loss weeks later. In this study, we demonstrate that these symptoms can be produced by chronically exposing brood to both an organosilicone surfactant adjuvant (OSS) commonly used on many agricultural crops including wine grapes, tree nuts and tree fruits and exogenous viral pathogens by simulating a horizontal transmission event. Observed synergistic mortality occurred during the larval-pupal molt. Using q-PCR techniques to measure gene expression and viral levels in larvae taken prior to observed mortality at metamorphosis, we found that exposure to OSS and exogenous virus resulted in significantly heightened Black Queen Cell Virus (BQCV) titers and lower expression of a Toll 7-like-receptor associated with autophagic viral defense (Am18w). These results demonstrate that organosilicone spray adjuvants that are considered biologically inert potentiate viral pathogenicity in honey bee larvae, and guidelines for OSS use may be warranted. © The Author(s) 2017.			2017-01-16
Multiresidue method for trace pesticide analysis in honeybee wax comb by GC-QqQ-MS	The aim of this analytical study is to develop an improved multi-residue methodology of high sensitivity and expanded scope for pesticide residue analysis in honeybee wax combs. The method was validated for 160 pesticide residues (including acaricides, insecticides, fungicides and herbicides) gas chromatography amenable and covering a wide variety of polarity and chemical structure. This method of analysis applied gas chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer for the quantitative analysis of pesticide residues. The extraction procedure applied was based QuEChERs method allowing acceptable recoveries for most of the pesticides (98%), within the range 60–120% with an associated precision (RSD) <20%, at concentration levels of MQL of 10ï¿½ï¿½gï¿½kg−1for all pesticides with the exception of 3,5-dichloroaniline and chlordane (20ï¿½ï¿½gï¿½kg−1). The expanded uncertainty of the results was ï¿½35% on average (coverage factor k=2 for a confidence level of 95%). The chromatographic multi-residue method was applied to determine levels of pesticide residues in 50 honeybee wax comb samples randomly collected from different apiaries in Spain. A total of 32 pesticide residues (14 insecticides/acaricides, 10 insecticides, 6 fungicides and 2 herbicides) were detected in the samples. The highest pesticide concentrations were found for those with insecticide-acaricide activity like acrinathrin, chlorfenvinphos, coumaphos and fluvalinate-tau, some of them are mainly applied in apiculture for controlling the honeybee parasite Varroa destructor. The total load of pesticide residues ranged from 69 to 1000ï¿½ï¿½gï¿½kg−1for 40% of the analysed samples, 22% contained pesticide residues in the ranges of 1000–2000ï¿½ï¿½gï¿½kg−1, 24% between 2000 and 5000ï¿½ï¿½gï¿½kg−1and 14% of the samples contained residues between 5000 and 9557ï¿½ï¿½gï¿½kg−1. ï¿½ 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A â €'Landscape physiology' approach for assessing bee health highlights the benefits of floral landscape enrichment and semi-natural habitats	Understanding how anthropogenic landscape alteration affects populations of ecologically- and economically-important insect pollinators has never been more pressing. In this context, the assessment of landscape quality typically relies on spatial distribution studies, but, whether habitat-restoration techniques actually improve the health of targeted pollinator populations remains obscure. This gap could be filled by a comprehensive understanding of how gradients of landscape quality influence pollinator physiology. We therefore used this approach for honey bees (Apis mellifera) to test whether landscape patterns can shape bee health. We focused on the pre-wintering period since abnormally high winter colony losses have often been observed. By exposing colonies to different landscapes, enriched in melliferous catch crops and surrounded by semi-natural habitats, we found that bee physiology (i.e. fat body mass and level of vitellogenin) was significantly improved by the presence of flowering catch crops. Catch crop presence was associated with a significant increase in pollen diet diversity. The influence of semi-natural habitats on bee health was even stronger. Vitellogenin level was in turn significantly linked to higher overwintering survival. Therefore, our experimental study, combining landscape ecology and bee physiology, offers an exciting proof-of-concept for directly identifying stressful or suitable landscapes and promoting efficient pollinator conservation. © The Author(s) 2017.			2017-01-13

A review: Risk assessment of pesticides on honey bee and pollination of agriculture crops in Pakistan	This paper reviews the importance of honey bee as pollinator of agriculture crops, fruit, vegetables, seeds etc. and losses in agriculture, honey bee and honey production due to use of chemical pesticides. Honey bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) is economically important insect. Honeybees are existing all around world excluding extreme Polar Regions. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) add approximately US $200 billion to the global economy every year, mainly through crop pollination. Productivity worth of pollination dependent crops equal to US$ 1590 million in Pakistan where 61 main pollinate crops are considered as foodstuff (26 fruits, 19 vegetable, 7 oilseeds, 4 grain legumes, 2 flavoring crops and 3 nut shrubs) depend on honey bee pollination. Honey bee population is declining with alarming speed all around the world and it is endangering global food security because one third of agriculture production depend upon on pollination particularly by honey bee. Current reduction in honey bee population for agriculture pollination is threatening to nuts, fruit, vegetable and seed production in Pakistan. Several factors responsible for decline of honey bee colonies including climate change, predation by other insects, air pollution, ecosemiotic collapse, the alteration of the bee microbiome, electromagnetic radiation from the sun, expose to initial life stress, nano materials, and biochemical pesticides, diseases, parasites surroundings of honey bees. The toxic chemicals are transported in hive through the pollen and nectar which may destroy the entire honey bee colony. Pesticides pattern applied in agriculture have been changed in last decade. This review research indicates how pesticide is used in agricultural crops for control of pests affecting on honey bee health and decline of bee populations. Then concludes with intensive studies on current management protocols would support in procedure formulation and resolution making polices regarding to shelter honey bees and management of pollination for agriculture purpose, which is lacking.			2017-01-01
Exposure of honey bees (Apis mellifera) to different classes of insecticides exhibit distinct molecular effect patterns at concentrations that mimic environmental contamination	Pesticides are implicated in the decline of honey bee populations. Many insecticides are neurotoxic and act by different modes of actions. Although a link between insecticide exposure and changed behaviour has been made, molecular effects underlying these effects are poorly understood. Here we elucidated molecular effects at environmental realistic concentrations of two organophosphates, chlorpyrifos and malathion, the pyrethroid cypermethrin, and the ryanodine receptor activator, chlorantraniliprole. We assessed transcriptional alterations of selected genes at three exposure times (24ï¿½h, 48ï¿½h, 72ï¿½h) in caged honey bees exposed to different concentrations of these compounds. Our targeted gene expression concept focused on several transcripts, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α 1 and α 2 (nAChRα1, nAChRα2) subunits, the multifunctional gene vitellogenin, immune system related genes of three immune system pathways, genes belonging to the detoxification system and ER stress genes. Our data indicate a dynamic pattern of expressional changes at different exposure times. All four insecticides induced strong alterations in the expression of immune system related genes suggesting negative implications for honey bee health, as well as cytochrome P450 enzyme transcripts suggesting an interference with metabolism. Exposure to neurotoxic chlorpyrifos, malathion and cypermethrin resulted in up-regulation of nAChRα1 and nAChRα2. Moreover, alterations in the expression of vitellogenin occurred, which suggests implications on foraging activity. Chlorantraniliprole induced ER stress which may be related to toxicity. The comparison of all transcriptional changes indicated that the expression pattern is rather compound-specific and related to its mode of action, but clusters of common transcriptional changes between different compounds occurred. As transcriptional alterations occurred at environmental concentrations our data provide a molecular basis for observed adverse effects of these insecticides to bees. ï¿½ 2017 Elsevier Ltd		Detoxification, Food products, Genes, Immune system, Insecticides, Pesticides, Population statistics, Environmental concentration, Environmental contamination, Honey bee, Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, Organophosphates, Pesticide exposure, Pyrethroids, Transcriptional changes, Gene expression, chlorantraniliprole, chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, cytochrome P450, insecticide, malathion, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha1, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha2, nicotinic receptor, unclassified drug, vitellogenin, chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, cytochrome P450, insecticide, malathion, pesticide, pollutant, pyrethroid, bee, concentration (composition), gene expression, immune system, insecticide, metabolism, organophosphate, pollution exposure, pyrethroid pesticide, adult, animal experiment, animal tissue, Apis mellifera, Article, concentration (parameters), controlled study, detoxification, endoplasmic reticulum stress, gene expression, genetic transcription, molecular biology, nonhuman, pollution, protein expression, upregulation, animal, bee, drug effects, drug inactivation, metabolism, physiology, pollutant, toxicity, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Animals, Bees, Chlorpyrifos, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, Environmental Pollutants, Gene Expression, Inactivation, Metabolic, Insecticides, Malathion, Pesticides, Pyrethrins, Up-Regulation	2017-01-01
Two commercial formulations of natural compounds for Varroa destructor (Acari: Varroidae) control on Africanized bees under tropical climatic conditions	It is not uncommon for natural pesticide products to perform inconsistently under different test conditions. Because patented treatments based on natural products have not been tested for the control of Varroa destructor on Africanized hybrid bees under tropical climates in field conditions, an experiment comparing the efficacy of two such natural products was performed. Apilife Var® is a product based on thymol, menthol, eucalyptus and camphor, mixed in a matrix of vermiculite. Hive Clean® contains oxalic acid, sucrose, citric acid, formic acid and propolis. Eighteen Jumbo type hives with Africanized hybrid bees of Apis mellifera from the central region of Veracruz, Mexico, were used. A hive was considered as an experimental unit. Hive Clean® and Apilife Var® treatments consisted of 6 hives each, and the control consisted of 3 hives at an apiary at Tejería, Veracruz, Mexico. The experiment took place from October to December 2013, with an average temperature of 28° C. A Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test was used to separate the corrected percentage of fallen varroa. Apilife Var® was significantly more effective (p = 0.002) with a median number of fallen varroa of 95.8% (mean = 95.5%). The results show that Apilife Var® is a product with a considerable acaricide action on varroa infestations, with an even emission of volatiles under a tropical subhumid climate, with no harm to the bee population on the hive. On the other hand, Hive Clean® showed a median percentage of fallen varroa of 19.7% (mean = 16.7%), indicating lower efficacy levels than those reported by European laboratories under temperate climates and with European bees (A. mellifera carnica). Thus, this product may need to be reformulated and re-tested under tropical climate conditions with Africanized bees. © 2017 International Bee Research Association.			2017-01-01
Factors of honeybee colony performances on sunflower at apiary scale	An observatory of honeybee colonies (Apis mellifera), consisting of at least 200 colonies, divided into 10 apiaries of 20 colonies, was monitored for three years on sunflower honeyflow (2015-2017). The purpose of this observatory is to understand which factors control colony performance during sunflower honeyflow in south-western France. From the temporal dynamics of weight gain, statistical analysis reveals a hierarchy of factors. First, variability in apiary scale performance is an image of the effect of resource variability. But, in addition to this primordial factor, two other factors contribute very significantly to performance. On the one hand, the amount of capped brood and the number of bees at the time of the installation of the apiary: these two elements testify to the vitality of the colony. The second remarkable factor is the Varroa load, which strongly penalizes performance beyond a certain threshold. The negative effect of the Varroa load on the colony performance is minimized in case of abondant sunflower honey flow. © A. Kretzschmar and L. Frontero, Published by EDP Sciences, 2017.			2017-01-01
Biophysical characterization of the Varroa destructor Na<inf>V</inf>τ-fluvalinate insecticide	The decline of the western honeybee (Apis mellifera) has been reported to be due to parasitism by Varroa destructor mites and to colony collapse disorder in which these mites may be involved. In-hive chemicals such as τ-fluvalinate are being used to control V. destructor populations. This approach may lead to the chronic exposure of bees to this liposoluble chemical, which tends to accumulate in hives. We cloned a variant of the V. destructor voltage-dependent sodium (VdNaV1) channel and studied its biophysical characteristics and sensitivity to τ-fluvalinate using the Xenopus oocyte expression system and the 2-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. We compared the affinity of VdNaV1 for τ-fluvalinate with the honeybee voltage-dependent sodium ortholog. Our results showed that the honeybee sodium channel is more sensitive to τ-fluvalinate than the V. destructor channel, suggesting that care must be taken when treating hives with this chemical. © FASEB.		insecticide, tau fluvalinate, unclassified drug, voltage gated sodium channel, arthropod protein, fluvalinate, insecticide, nitrile, pyrethroid, sodium channel, amino acid sequence, animal cell, Apis mellifera, Article, binding affinity, heterologous expression, microelectrode, molecular cloning, nonhuman, oocyte, priority journal, Varroa destructor, voltage clamp technique, Xenopus, animal, bee, chemistry, gene expression regulation, genetics, metabolism, parasitology, pharmacogenetic variant, physiology, Varroidae, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Arthropod Proteins, Bees, Cloning, Molecular, Gene Expression Regulation, Insecticides, Nitriles, Oocytes, Pharmacogenomic Variants, Pyrethrins, Sodium Channels, Varroidae, Xenopus	2017-01-01
Combined effects of waggle dance communication and landscape heterogeneity on nectar and pollen uptake in honey bee colonies	The instructive component of waggle dance communication has been shown to increase resource uptake of Apis mellifera colonies in highly heterogeneous resource environments, but an assessment of its relevance in temperate landscapes with different levels of resource heterogeneity is currently lacking. We hypothesized that the advertisement of resource locations via dance communication would be most relevant in highly heterogeneous landscapes with large spatial variation of floral resources. To test our hypothesis, we placed 24 Apis mellifera colonies with either disrupted or unimpaired instructive component of dance communication in eight Central European agricultural landscapes that differed in heterogeneity and resource availability. We monitored colony weight change and pollen harvest as measure of foraging success. Dance disruption did not significantly alter colony weight change, but decreased pollen harvest compared to the communicating colonies by 40%. There was no general effect of resource availability on nectar or pollen foraging success, but the effect of landscape heterogeneity on nectar uptake was stronger when resource availability was high. In contrast to our hypothesis, the effects of disrupted bee communication on nectar and pollen foraging success were not stronger in landscapes with heterogeneous compared to homogenous resource environments. Our results indicate that in temperate regions intra-colonial communication of resource locations benefits pollen foraging more than nectar foraging, irrespective of landscape heterogeneity. We conclude that the so far largely unexplored role of dance communication in pollen foraging requires further consideration as pollen is a crucial resource for colony development and health. © 2017 Nürnberger et al.		advertising, Apis mellifera, dancing, foraging behavior, landscape ecology, nectar, nonhuman	2017-01-01
Multiple pesticide residues in live and poisoned honeybees – Preliminary exposure assessment	Study combines data about the exposure of honeybees to pesticides from plant protection products and veterinary medicinal products. Residues of 200 pesticide and pesticide metabolites in 343 live and 74 poisoned honeybee samples, obtained during the years of 2014–2015, were determined by LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS. In 44% of live honeybee 48 different pesticide residues were found, mainly amitraz metabolites (DMF, DMPF) and chlorpyrifos. In 98% of poisoned honeybee 57 pesticides and metabolites were detected, mainly chlorpyrifos, dimethoate and clothianidin. In total 84 different pesticides were detected both in live and poisoned honeybees, they indicate 30 various modes of action. Differences between mean number of pesticide residues detected in live and poisoned honeybees clearly indicate the impact of multiple pesticides on honeybee health. Possible impact of systemic fungicides on the health of honeybees was studied. Applicability of hazard quotient counted as ratio between concentration of pesticides in honeybees and lethal dose in the interpretation whether detected concentration indicates acute toxic effects was shown. ï¿½ 2017 Elsevier Ltd		Biomolecules, Fungicides, Hazards, Insecticides, Metabolites, Acute toxic effects, Exposure, Hazard quotients, Honeybee, Pesticide metabolites, Pesticide residue, Plant protection products, Veterinary medicinal products, Pesticides, 2,4 dimethylanilin, acetamiprid, amitraz, azoxystrobin, bentazon, boscalid, bromopropylate, bupirimate, carbendazim, chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos methyl, clothianidin, coumafos, cyprodinil, difenoconazole, dimethoate, epoxiconazole, fenazaquin, fenhexamid, fludioxonil, iprodione, pendimethalin, pesticide residue, prochloraz, propamocarb, propiconazole, tebuconazole, thiacloprid, thiophanate methyl, trifloxystrobin, unclassified drug, ((E)-1-(2-chloro-1,3-thiazol-5-ylmethyl)-3-methyl-2-nitroguanidine), amitraz, chlorpyrifos, dimethoate, guanidine derivative, pesticide, pesticide residue, thiazole derivative, toluidine derivative, concentration (composition), fungicide, honeybee, insecticide, metabolite, pesticide residue, pollution effect, pollution exposure, toxicity test, Article, environmental exposure, gas chromatography, gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, hazard, honeybee, intoxication, LD50, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, nonhuman, screening, tandem mass spectrometry, analysis, animal, bee, chemistry, drug effects, environmental exposure, liquid chromatography, Apis mellifera, Animals, Bees, Chlorpyrifos, Chromatography, Liquid, Dimethoate, Environmental Exposure, Guanidines, Pesticide Residues, Pesticides, Tandem Mass Spectrometry, Thiazoles, Toluidines	2017-01-01
Impact of environmental conditions and agro-technical factors on ground beetle populations in arable crops	Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) are the largest family of adephagan beetles. Their role in natural pest control is important due to their predatory polyphagous nutrition and bioindicative value since they are sensitive to environmental and anthropogenic changes. Therefore, the main objectives were to understand how common arable cropping systems in Croatia affect ground beetles abundance in respect to the environmental conditions. We hypothesized that environmental specifics (soil type and structure, climatic conditions) together with cultivation measures (tillage and insecticide application) would affect ground beetle activity and abundance. The research was conducted in two locations Lukač, Virovitica – Podravina County and Tovarnik, Vukovar – Sirmium County. Ground beetles were collected weekly, from May to September 2015, by epigeic pitfall traps and endogeic perforated probes from fields sown with typical arable crops in these areas. In total, 2,582 ground beetle individuals were collected using epigeic traps, and 323 ground beetles were collected using endogeic traps. Significantly lower ground beetle abundance has been recorded in Tovarnik than in Lukač. The crop and cropping history affect the abundance through modification of environmental conditions (soil characteristics, microclimate factors such as temperature and humidity), as well as trough disturbance factors such as tillage schedules and harvest/sowing schedules. © 2017, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.			2017-01-01
Impact of Thiamethoxam on Honey Bee Queen (Apis mellifera carnica) Reproductive Morphology and Physiology	High honey bee losses around the world have been linked in part by the regular use of neonicotinoids in agriculture. In light of the current situation, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of thiamethoxam on the development of the reproductive system and physiology in the honey bee queen. Two experimental groups of honey bee queen larvae were treated with thiamethoxam during artificial rearing, applied via artificial feed in two cycles. In the first rearing cycle, honey bee larvae received a single treatment dose (4.28 ng thiamethoxam/queen larva on the 4th day after larvae grafting in artificial queen cells), while the second honey bee queen rearing cycle received a double treatment dose (total of 8.56 ng thiamethoxam/queen larva on the 4th and 5th day after larvae grafting in artificial queen cells). After emerging, queens were anesthetized and weighed, and after mating with drones were anesthetized, weighed, and sectioned. Ovary mass and number of stored sperm were determined. Body weight differed between untreated and treated honey bee queens. The results also show a decrease in the number of sperm within honey bee queen spermathecae that received the double thiamethoxam dose. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Honey bee colonies remote monitoring system	Bees are very important for terrestrial ecosystems and, above all, for the subsistence of many crops, due to their ability to pollinate flowers. Currently, the honey bee populations are decreasing due to colony collapse disorder (CCD). The reasons for CCD are not fully known, and as a result, it is essential to obtain all possible information on the environmental conditions surrounding the beehives. On the other hand, it is important to carry out such information gathering as non-intrusively as possible to avoid modifying the bees’ work conditions and to obtain more reliable data. We designed a wireless-sensor networks meet these requirements. We designed a remote monitoring system (called WBee) based on a hierarchical three-level model formed by the wireless node, a local data server, and a cloud data server. WBee is a low-cost, fully scalable, easily deployable system with regard to the number and types of sensors and the number of hives and their geographical distribution. WBee saves the data in each of the levels if there are failures in communication. In addition, the nodes include a backup battery, which allows for further data acquisition and storage in the event of a power outage. Unlike other systems that monitor a single point of a hive, the system we present monitors and stores the temperature and relative humidity of the beehive in three different spots. Additionally, the hive is continuously weighed on a weighing scale. Real-time weight measurement is an innovation in wireless beehive—monitoring systems. We designed an adaptation board to facilitate the connection of the sensors to the node. Through the Internet, researchers and beekeepers can access the cloud data server to find out the condition of their hives in real time. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Diet effects on bumblebee health	Among physiological processes, the maintenance of immunity is one of the most energetically costly in invertebrates. Disease resistance can be quantified by measuring immunocompetence, which is defined as the ability of an organism to mount an immune response, either in cellular, humoral or behavioural forms. In insects, immune capacity can be affected by a variety of factors including pesticides, genetic diversity or diet. Here we focus on an important species of domesticated pollinator, Bombus terrestris, and the potential impact of a poor pollen diet (low nutritional content and toxic) on its health. We investigate three responses at both colony and individual levels: behavioural, humoral and cellular. Our results show that poor pollen diets decrease larval and pupal masses and increase larval ejection as well as adult constitutive immunity (i.e., prophenoloxidase assays). The susceptibility of bumblebees to disease and infection might therefore be greater after a nutritive stress. These findings raise the importance of available plant hosts, especially floral plant species providing pollen with suitable nutritive quality (i.e., nutrient pollen content) for bumblebees. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd		bee, diet, disease resistance, genetic variation, immune response, immune system, immunity, immunocompetence, infectious disease, pesticide, pollen, Bombus terrestris, Hexapoda, Invertebrata, animal, animal food, bee, chemistry, diet, growth, development and aging, larva, nutritional value, physiology, pollen, pupa, Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena, Animals, Bees, Diet, Larva, Nutritive Value, Pollen, Pupa	2017-01-01
Non-target evaluation of contaminants in honey bees and pollen samples by gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry	This work presents a non-targeted screening approach for the detection and quantitation of contaminants in bees and pollen, collected from the same hive, by GC-EI-ToF-MS. It consists of a spectral library datasets search using a compound database followed by a manual investigation and analytical standard confirmation together with semi-quantitation purposes. Over 20% of the compounds found automatically by the library search could not be confirmed manually. This number of false positive detections was mainly a consequence of an inadequate ion ratio criterion (±30%), not considered in the automatic searching procedure. Eight compounds were detected in bees and pollen. They include insecticides/acaricides (chlorpyrifos, coumaphos, fluvalinate-tau, chlorfenvinphos, pyridaben, and propyl cresol) at a concentration range of 1–1207 μg kg−1, herbicides (oxyfluorfen) at a concentration range of 212–1773 μg kg−1 and a growth regulator hormone (methoprene). Some compounds were detected only in pollen; such as herbicides (clomazone), insecticides/acaricides and fungicides used to control Varroa mites as benzylbenzoate, bufencarb, allethrin, permethrin, eugenol and cyprodinil. Additional compounds were detected only in bees: flamprop-methyl, 2-methylphenol (2–49 μg kg−1) and naphthalene (1–23 μg kg−1). The proposed method presents important advantages as it can avoid the use of an unachievable number of analytical standards considered target compounds “a priori” but not present in the analyzed samples. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd		Herbicides, Impurities, Mass spectrometry, Naphthalene, Weed control, Bees, Concentration ranges, False positive detection, GC-EI-ToF-MS, Non-targeted, Pollen, Spectral libraries, Time of flight mass spectrometry, Gas chromatography, acaricide, fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, methoprene, naphthalene, ortho cresol, 2-cresol, acaricide, cresol, fluvalinate, fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, nitrile, pollutant, pyrethroid, database, fungicide, gas chromatography, growth regulator, herbicide, honeybee, hormone, mass spectrometry, mite, naphthalene, pollen, Article, contamination, evaluation study, gas chromatograph, gas chromatography, honeybee, limit of quantitation, nonhuman, pollen, time of flight mass spectrometry, Varroa, analysis, animal, bee, chemistry, environmental monitoring, honey, mass fragmentography, pollen, pollutant, procedures, toxicity testing, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Varroa, Acaricides, Animals, Bees, Cresols, Environmental Monitoring, Environmental Pollutants, Fungicides, Industrial, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, Herbicides, Honey, Insecticides, Nitriles, Pollen, Pyrethrins, Toxicity Tests	2017-01-01
Binary mixtures of neonicotinoids show different transcriptional changes than single neonicotinoids in honeybees (Apis mellifera)	Among the many factors responsible for the decline of bee populations are plant protection products such as neonicotinoids. In general, bees are exposed to not only one but mixtures of such chemicals. At environmental realistic concentrations neonicotinoids may display negative effects on the immune system, foraging activity, learning and memory formation of bees. Neonicotinoids induce alterations of gene transcripts such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits, vitellogenin, genes of the immune system and genes linked to memory formation. While previous studies focused on individual compounds, the effect of neonicotinoid mixtures in bees is poorly known. Here we investigated the effects of neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam as single compounds, and binary mixtures thereof in honeybees. We determined transcriptional changes of nAChR subunits and vitellogenin in the brain of experimentally exposed honeybees after exposure up to 72 h. Exposure concentrations were selected on the basis of lowest effect concentrations of the single compounds. Transcriptional induction of nAChRs and vitellogenin was strongest for thiamethoxam, and weakest for acetamiprid. To a large extent, binary mixtures did not show additive transcriptional inductions but they were less than additive. Our data suggest that the joint transcriptional activity of neonicotinoids cannot be explained by concentration addition. The in vivo effects are not only governed by agonistic interaction with nAChRs alone, but are more complex as a result of interactions with other pathways as well. Further studies are needed to investigate the physiological joint effects of mixtures of neonicotinoids and other plant protection products on bees to better understand their joint effects. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd		Bins, Genes, Immune system, Mixtures, Population statistics, Tobacco, Transcription, Honeybees, Neonicotinoids, Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, Transcription analysis, Vitellogenin, Binary mixtures, acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, neonicotinoid, nicotinic receptor, thiamethoxam, vitellogenin, ((E)-1-(2-chloro-1,3-thiazol-5-ylmethyl)-3-methyl-2-nitroguanidine), guanidine derivative, imidazole derivative, insecticide, nitro derivative, oxazine derivative, pyridine derivative, thiazole derivative, brain, concentration (composition), honeybee, neonicotinoid pesticide, physiological response, protein, adult, Apis mellifera, Article, binding affinity, brain, controlled study, gene expression, gene targeting, genetic transcription, in vivo study, mutation, nAChR gene, nonhuman, pest control, quantitative analysis, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, vitellogenin gene, animal, bee, drug effects, drug interaction, genetic transcription, genetics, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Animals, Bees, Drug Interactions, Guanidines, Imidazoles, Insecticides, Nitro Compounds, Oxazines, Pyridines, Receptors, Nicotinic, Thiazoles, Transcription, Genetic	2017-01-01
The effect of the ‘Bee Gym™’ grooming device on Varroa destructor mite fall from honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies	Grooming is a honey bee behavior that has the potential to minimize and manage the detrimental effects of Varroa destructor. Here we tested the efficacy of the Bee Gym™, a device hypothesized to increase honey bee auto-grooming and increase mite removal from colonies. Natural mite fall from 20 colonies was counted for 14 days, after which half the colonies were fitted with a Bee Gym and half with a control object. Mite fall and the proportion of damaged mites were then recorded for another 14 days. Total mite fall was generally higher over the second 14 days, but this increase was not significantly higher for the Bee Gym colonies than for the control colonies. There was also no difference in the proportion of damaged mites between the two treatments. Mite fall and damage to mites may be influenced by other factors, and this is discussed; however, given that we found no effect of the Bee Gym, we conclude that there is no evidence from this study of its efficacy as a management strategy for V. destructor. © 2017 The Author(s).

Lipid characterization of chestnut and willow honeybee-collected pollen: Impact of freeze-drying and microwave-assisted drying	Honeybee-collected pollen is gaining attention as functional food, due to its high content of bioactive compounds, such as essential amino acids, antioxidants, vitamins and lipids. Traditional conservation methods include drying in a hot air chamber or freezing. These techniques influence the pollen organoleptic properties and its content of nutraceutical compounds. We analysed the lipid component of two honeybee-collected pollens, Castanea sativa and Salix alba. Chestnut pollen was characterized by a higher level of omega-6 fatty acids, while willow pollen showed a higher concentration of omega-3 fatty acids and carotenoids. Furthermore, two novel conservation methods, freeze-drying and microwave-assisted drying, were proposed and their impact on the pollen lipid profile was assessed. Only the microwave treatment showed a damaging action on antioxidant compounds (i.e. reduction of tocopherols). Overall, this research shed light on the lipid profile of honeybee-collected pollen, highlighting the nutraceutical importance of pollen as a source of omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.			2017-01-01
Short reads from honey bee (Apis sp.) sequencing projects reflect microbial associate diversity	High throughput (or 'next generation') sequencing has transformed most areas of biological research and is now a standard method that underpins empirical study of or- ganismal biology, and (through comparison of genomes), reveals patterns of evolution. For projects focused on animals, these sequencing methods do not discriminate between the primary target of sequencing (the animal genome) and 'contaminating' material, such as associated microbes. A common first step is to filter out these contaminants to allow better assembly of the animal genome or transcriptome. Here, we aimed to assess if these 'contaminations' provide information with regard to biologically important microorganisms associated with the individual. To achieve this, we examined whether the short read data from Apis retrieved elements of its well established microbiome. To this end, we screened almost 1,000 short read libraries of honey bee (Apis sp.) DNA sequencing project for the presence of microbial sequences, and find sequences from known honey bee microbial associates in at least 11% of them. Further to this, we screened ~500 Apis RNA sequencing libraries for evidence of viral infections, which were found to be present in about half of them. We then used the data to reconstruct draft genomes of three Apis associated bacteria, as well as several viral strains de novo. We conclude that 'contamination' in short read sequencing libraries can provide useful genomic information on microbial taxa known to be associated with the target organisms, and may even lead to the discovery of novel associations. Finally, we demonstrate that RNAseq samples from experiments commonly carry uneven viral loads across libraries.Wenote variation in viral presence and load may be a confounding feature of differential gene expression analyses, and as such it should be incorporated as a random factor in analyses. © 2017 Gerth and Hurst.

Current knowledge of detoxification mechanisms of xenobiotic in honey bees	The western honey bee Apis mellifera is the most important managed pollinator species in the world. Multiple factors have been implicated as potential causes or factors contributing to colony collapse disorder, including honey bee pathogens and nutritional deficiencies as well as exposure to pesticides. Honey bees’ genome is characterized by a paucity of genes associated with detoxification, which makes them vulnerable to specific pesticides, especially to combinations of pesticides in real field environments. Many studies have investigated the mechanisms involved in detoxification of xenobiotics/pesticides in honey bees, from primal enzyme assays or toxicity bioassays to characterization of transcript gene expression and protein expression in response to xenobiotics/insecticides by using a global transcriptomic or proteomic approach, and even to functional characterizations. The global transcriptomic and proteomic approach allowed us to learn that detoxification mechanisms in honey bees involve multiple genes and pathways along with changes in energy metabolism and cellular stress response. P450 genes, is highly implicated in the direct detoxification of xenobiotics/insecticides in honey bees and their expression can be regulated by honey/pollen constitutes, resulting in the tolerance of honey bees to other xenobiotics or insecticides. P450s is also a key detoxification enzyme that mediate synergism interaction between acaricides/insecticides and fungicides through inhibition P450 activity by fungicides or competition for detoxification enzymes between acaricides. With the wide use of insecticides in agriculture, understanding the detoxification mechanism of insecticides in honey bees and how honeybees fight with the xenobiotis or insecticides to survive in the changing environment will finally benefit honeybees’ management. ï¿½ 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Exposure of larvae to thiamethoxam affects the survival and physiology of the honey bee at post-embryonic stages	Under laboratory conditions, the effects of thiamethoxam were investigated in larvae, pupae and emerging honey bees after exposure at larval stages with different concentrations in the food (0.00001 ng/μL, 0.001 ng/μL and 1.44 ng/μL). Thiamethoxam reduced the survival of larvae and pupae and consequently decreased the percentage of emerging honey bees. Thiamethoxam induced important physiological disturbances. It increased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity at all developmental stages and increased glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and carboxylesterase para (CaEp) activities at the pupal stages. For midgut alkaline phosphatase (ALP), no activity was detected in pupae stages, and no effect was observed in larvae and emerging bees. We assume that the effects of thiamethoxam on the survival, emergence and physiology of honey bees may affect the development of the colony. These results showed that attention should be paid to the exposure to pesticides during the developmental stages of the honey bee.

Can the exposure of Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera, Apiadae) larvae to a field concentration of thiamethoxam affect newly emerged bees?	The use of insecticides on crops can affect non-target insects, such as bees. In addition to the adult bees, larvae can be exposed to the insecticide through contaminated floral resources. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the possible effects of the exposure of A. mellifera larvae to a field concentration of thiamethoxam (0.001 ng/μL thiamethoxam) on larval and pupal survival and on the percentage of adult emergence. Additionally, its cytotoxic effects on the digestive cells of midgut, Malpighian tubules cells and Kenyon cells of the brain of newly emerged A. mellifera bees were analyzed. The results showed that larval exposure to this concentration of thiamethoxam did not influence larval and pupal survival or the percentage of adult bee emergence. However, this exposure caused ultra-structural alterations in the target and non-target organs of newly emerged bees. The digestive cell of bees that were exposed to the insecticide exhibited a basal labyrinth without long and thin channels and compromised mitochondria. In Malpighian tubules cells, disorganized basal labyrinth, dilated mitochondria with a deformed shape and a loss of cristae, and disorganized microvilli were observed. The results showed that the exposed bees presented Kenyon cells with alterations in the nucleus and mitochondria. These alterations indicate possible tissue degeneration, demonstrating the cytotoxicity of thiamethoxam in the target and non-target organs of newly emerged bees. Such results suggest cellular organelle impairment that can compromise cellular function of the midgut cells, Malpighian tubules cells and Kenyon cells, and, consequently, can compromise the longevity of the bees of the whole colony. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd		Cytology, Cytotoxicity, Insecticides, Bees, Malpighian tubules, Midgut, Mushroom bodies, Neonicotinoids, Ulstrastrucuture, Cells, insecticide, thiamethoxam, insecticide, nitro derivative, oxazine derivative, thiamethoxam, thiazole derivative, adult, brain, cells and cell components, concentration (composition), digestive system, emergence, honeybee, insecticide, larva, longevity, nontarget organism, pollution effect, pollution exposure, pupa, survival, thiamethoxam, toxicity, ultrastructure, adulthood, Apis mellifera, Article, concentration (parameters), cytotoxicity, gastric cell line, honeybee, kenyon cell, larva, Malpighian tubule, microvillus, midgut, mitochondrion, nonhuman, pupa, survival, animal, bee, crop, digestive system, drug effects, Hymenoptera, longevity, physiology, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Basidiomycota, Hexapoda, Hymenoptera, Animals, Bees, Crops, Agricultural, Digestive System, Hymenoptera, Insecticides, Larva, Longevity, Nitro Compounds, Oxazines, Pupa, Thiazoles	2017-01-01
Cytochrome P450 genes from the aquatic midge Chironomus tentans: Atrazine-induced up-regulation of CtCYP6EX3 enhanced the toxicity of chlorpyrifos	The open reading frames of 19 cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP) genes were sequenced from Chironomus tentans, a commonly used freshwater invertebrate model. Phylogenetic analysis of the 19 CYPs along with a previously reported CYP (CtCYP4G33) revealed that they belong to three different clans, including 3 in CYP4, 15 in CYP3, and 2 in mitochondria clan. When third-instar larvae were exposed to atrazine at 5000 μg/L, the transcription of CtCYP6EX3, CtCYP6EV3, CtCYP9AT1 and CtCYPEX1 was significantly up-regulated. To examine whether CtCYP6EX3 played a role in oxidative activation of chlorpyrifos to chlorpyrifos-oxon, we evaluated larval susceptibility to chlorpyrifos after CtCYP6EX3 transcript was suppressed by RNAi. The larvae fed chitosan/dsCtCYP6EX3 nanoparticles showed a significantly decreased CtCYP6EX3 transcript (53.1%) as compared with the control larvae fed chitosan/dsGFP nanoparticles. When the CtCYP6EX3-silenced larvae were exposed to chlorpyrifos at 6 μg/L or its binary mixture with atrazine (chlorpyrifos at 3 μg/L and atrazine at 1000 μg/L), the larvae became less susceptible to the pesticides as their mortalities decreased by 24.1% and 20.5%, respectively. These results along with our previous findings suggested that the increased toxicity of chlorpyrifos was likely due to an enhanced oxidative process from chlorpyrifos to chlorpyrifos-oxon by CtCYP6EX3 as RNAi of CtCYP6EX3 led to decreased susceptibility of C. tentans larvae to chlorpyrifos alone and the binary mixture of atrazine and chlorpyrifos. However, further study would be necessary to validate our results by functional assays using heterologously expressed CtCYP6EX3 enzyme. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd		Binary mixtures, Bins, Chitin, Chitosan, Genes, Mixtures, Nanoparticles, Toxicity, Transcription, Chironomus, Chlorpyrifos, Cytochrome P450 genes, Freshwater invertebrates, Monooxygenases, Open reading frame, Phylogenetic analysis, RNA interference, Herbicides, atrazine, chitosan, chlorpyrifos, cytochrome P450, cytochrome P450 3A, cytochrome P450 4A, nanoparticle, atrazine, chlorpyrifos, cytochrome P-450 CYP9A1, cytochrome P450, cytochrome P450 family 6, insecticide, O,O-diethyl O-3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl phosphate, aquatic organism, atrazine, chlorpyrifos, cytochrome, ecotoxicology, gene expression, induced response, insect, larva, mortality, nanoparticle, oxidative stress, phylogenetics, pollution effect, pollution exposure, RNA, vulnerability, amino acid sequence, animal tissue, aquatic species, Article, Chironomus tentans, comparative study, controlled study, ctcyp6ev3 gene, ctcyp6ex3 gene, ctcyp9at1 gene, cyctpex1 gene, gene, gene repression, genetic susceptibility, genetic transcription, insect genetics, invertebrate model, larva, nonhuman, nucleotide sequence, open reading frame, phylogenetic tree, phylogeny, RNA interference, sequence analysis, toxicity, upregulation, analogs and derivatives, animal, Chironomidae, drug effects, enzymology, metabolism, upregulation, water pollutant, Chironomidae, Chironomus tentans, Invertebrata, Animals, Atrazine, Chironomidae, Chlorpyrifos, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, Cytochrome P450 Family 6, Insecticides, Larva, Up-Regulation, Water Pollutants, Chemical	2017-01-01
Agricultural pesticides and veterinary substances in Uruguayan beeswax	Over the last decade, Uruguay has expanded and intensified its rainfed crop production. This process has affected beekeeping in several ways: for example, by reducing the space available. This has increased the density of apiaries, the risk of varroosis and acaricide use. Additionally, the dominance of no-tillage crops has increased the frequencies of application and of loads of pesticides in regions where such crops share the land with beekeeping and honey production. Therefore, the exposure of bees to xenobiotics (agricultural pesticides and veterinary products) has increased in line with pollution of hives and their products. To document pollution from hive exposure to pesticides, we surveyed the presence of 30 xenobiotics normally used in Uruguay, in recycled beeswax (RB) and in honey cappings (HC) from the main Uruguayan beekeeping regions. There was contamination of all the analyzed samples (RB and HC) with the herbicide atrazine at a range of 1–2ï¿½ngï¿½g−1. At least three or four additional xenobiotics were detected: insecticides (chlorpyrifos-ethyl and thiacloprid); fungicides (azoxystrobin and tebuconazole); and veterinary products (coumaphos, ethion, and tau-fluvalinate). The frequency of detection of chlorpyrifos-ethyl and coumaphos in RB samples was higher than in those of HC. Moreover, the concentrations of azoxystrobin, coumaphos, and tebuconazole in RB samples were higher than in HC samples. Therefore, we suggest the use of HC to produce recycled printed beeswax films for use in hives to minimize pollution transfer. ï¿½ 2017 Elsevier Ltd		Agriculture, Biochemistry, Crops, Cultivation, Herbicides, Insecticides, Pesticides, Plants (botany), Pollution, Recycling, Waxes, Acaricides, Agricultural pesticides, Azoxystrobin, Beeswax, Chlorpyrifos ethyls, Honey bee, Honey production, Tebuconazole, Food products, acetamiprid, atrazine, bromopropylate, carbaril, carbendazim, chlorpyrifos, clofenvinfos, clothianidin, coumafos, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, dimethoate, dimpylate, environmental, industrial and domestic chemicals, ethion, fipronil, fungicide, imidacloprid, iprodione, methidathion, methomyl, neonicotinoid, parathion methyl, pesticide, propolis, tebuconazole, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, unclassified drug, veterinary substance, xenobiotic agent, acaricide, fluvalinate, fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, nitrile, pesticide, propolis, pyrethroid, wax, xenobiotic agent, acaricide, apiculture, atrazine, dose-response relationship, honeybee, pollution exposure, tebuconazole, wax, xenobiotics, zero tillage, Article, health hazard, honeybee, limit of quantitation, nonhuman, pollution, risk assessment, Uruguay, agriculture, analysis, animal, apiculture, bee, chemistry, geography, honey, mass fragmentography, Uruguay, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Acaricides, Agriculture, Animals, Beekeeping, Bees, Fungicides, Industrial, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, Geography, Herbicides, Honey, Insecticides, Nitriles, Pesticides, Pyrethrins, Risk Assessment, Uruguay, Waxes, Xenobiotics	2017-01-01
Ornamental plants on sale to the public are a significant source of pesticide residues with implications for the health of pollinating insects	Garden centres frequently market nectar- and pollen-rich ornamental plants as “pollinator-friendly”, however these plants are often treated with pesticides during their production. There is little information on the nature of pesticide residues present at the point of purchase and whether these plants may actually pose a threat to, rather than benefit, the health of pollinating insects. Using mass spectrometry analyses, this study screened leaves from 29 different ‘bee-friendly’ plants for 8 insecticides and 16 fungicides commonly used in ornamental production. Only two plants (a Narcissus and a Salvia variety) did not contain any pesticide and 23 plants contained more than one pesticide, with some species containing mixtures of 7 (Ageratum houstonianum) and 10 (Erica carnea) different agrochemicals. Neonicotinoid insecticides were detected in more than 70% of the analysed plants, and chlorpyrifos and pyrethroid insecticides were found in 10% and 7% of plants respectively. Boscalid, spiroxamine and DMI-fungicides were detected in 40% of plants. Pollen samples collected from 18 different plants contained a total of 13 different pesticides. Systemic compounds were detected in pollen samples at similar concentrations to those in leaves. However, some contact (chlorpyrifos) and localised penetrant pesticides (iprodione, pyroclastrobin and prochloraz) were also detected in pollen, likely arising from direct contamination during spraying. The neonicotinoids thiamethoxam, clothianidin and imidacloprid and the organophosphate chlorpyrifos were present in pollen at concentrations between 6.9 and 81 ng/g and at levels that overlap with those known to cause harm to bees. The net effect on pollinators of buying plants that are a rich source of forage for them but simultaneously risk exposing them to a cocktail of pesticides is not clear. Gardeners who wish to gain the benefits without the risks should seek uncontaminated plants by growing their own from seed, plant-swapping or by buying plants from an organic nursery. © 2017		Agricultural chemicals, Drug products, Fungicides, Health risks, Insecticides, Mass spectrometry, Pesticides, Seed, Exposure, Mass spectrometry analysis, Neonicotinoid insecticides, Neonicotinoids, Organophosphate, Ornamental plants, Pollen, Pyrethroid insecticide, Plants (botany), boscalid, chlorpyrifos, clothianidin, demethylation inhibiting fungicide, fungicide, imidacloprid, iprodione, neonicotinoid, pesticide, pesticide residue, prochloraz, pyrethroid, pyroclastrobin, spiroxamine, thiamethoxam, unclassified drug, ((E)-1-(2-chloro-1,3-thiazol-5-ylmethyl)-3-methyl-2-nitroguanidine), agricultural chemical, fungicide, guanidine derivative, imidazole derivative, insecticide, nectar, nitro derivative, oxazine derivative, pesticide, pesticide residue, thiazole derivative, bee, nontarget organism, organophosphorus pesticide, ornamental species, pesticide residue, pollen, pollination, pollution exposure, Ageratum houstonianum, Article, concentration (parameters), controlled study, crop production, environmental exposure, Erica carnea, Ericaceae, forage, mass spectrometry, Narcissus, nonhuman, ornamental plant, pesticide spraying, plant insect interaction, plant leaf, pollen, pollinator, residue analysis, risk benefit analysis, Salvia, animal, bee, chemistry, drug effects, environmental monitoring, gardening, insect, nectar, plant seed, pollination, Ageratum houstonianum, Apoidea, Erica carnea, Hexapoda, Narcissus, Salvia, Spermatophyta, Agrochemicals, Animals, Bees, Environmental Monitoring, Fungicides, Industrial, Gardening, Guanidines, Imidazoles, Insecticides, Insects, Nitro Compounds, Oxazines, Pesticide Residues, Pesticides, Plant Nectar, Pollen, Pollination, Seeds, Thiazoles	2017-01-01
Influence of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam on miRNA expression in the honey bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae)	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous noncoding single-stranded RNAs regulating gene expression in eukaryotes. They play important roles in regulating caste differentiation, behavior development, and immune defences in the honey bee, Apis mellifera (Linnaeus) (Hymenoptera: Apidae). In this study, we explored the effect of the neonicotinoid insecticide, thiamethoxam, on miRNA expression in this species using deep small RNA sequencing. The results showed that seven miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed (q-value <0.01 and |log2(fold-change)| >1) upon exposure to 10 ppb thiamethoxam over 10 d. Some candidate target genes were related to behavior, immunity, and neural function. Several miRNAs, including ame-miR-124, ame-miR-981, ame-miR-3791, and ame-miR-6038, were selected and further validated using real-time quantitative PCR analysis.

Risk assessment of the endocrine-disrupting effects of nine chiral pesticides	The increased release of chiral pesticides into the environment has generated interest in the role of enantioselectivity in the environmental fate and ecotoxicological effects of these compounds. However, the information on the endocrine disrupting effects (EDEs) of chiral pesticides is still limited and discrepancies are also usually observed among different assays. In this study, we investigated the enantioselectivity of EDEs via estrogen and thyroid hormone receptors for nine chiral pesticides using in vitro and in silico approaches. The results of the luciferase reporter gene assays showed 7 chiral pesticides possessed enantioselective estrogenic activities and 2 chiral pesticides exerted thyroid hormone antagonistic effects. Proliferation assays in MCF-7 and GH3 cells were also used to verify the results of the dual-luciferase reporter gene assays. At last, the molecular docking results indicated that the enantioselective EDEs of chiral pesticides were partially due to enantiospecific binding affinities with receptors. Our data not only show enantioselective EDEs of nine chiral pesticides, but also would be helpful to better understanding the molecular biological mechanisms of enantioselectivity in EDEs of chiral pesticides. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Spontaneous honeybee behaviour is altered by persistent organic pollutants	The effect of environmental pollutants on honeybee behaviour has focused mainly on currently used pesticides. However, honeybees are also exposed to persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The aim of this laboratory based study was to determine if exposure to sublethal field-relevant concentrations of POPs altered the spontaneous behaviour of foraging-age worker honeybees. Honeybees (Apis mellifera) were orally exposed to either a sublethal concentration of the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture Aroclor 1254 (100 ng/ml), the organochlorine insecticide lindane (2.91 ng/ml) or vehicle (0.01% DMSO, 0.00015% ethanol in 1M sucrose) for 1–4 days. The frequency of single event behaviours and the time engaged in one of four behavioural states (walking, flying, upside down and stationary) were monitored for 15 min after 1, 2, 3 and 4 days exposure. Exposure to Aroclor 1254 but not lindane increased the frequency and time engaged in honeybee motor activity behaviours in comparison to vehicle. The Aroclor 1254—induced hyperactivity was evident after 1 day of exposure and persisted with repeated daily exposure. In contrast, 1 day of exposure to lindane elicited abdominal spasms and increased the frequency of grooming behaviours in comparison to vehicle exposure. After 4 days of exposure, abdominal spasms and increased grooming behaviours were also evident in honeybees exposed to Aroclor 1254. These data demonstrate that POPs can induce distinct behavioural patterns, indicating different toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic properties. The changes in spontaneous behaviour, particularly the PCB-induced chronic hyperactivity and the associated energy demands, may have implications for colony health. ï¿½ 2016, The Author(s).		aroclor 1254, lindane, polychlorinated biphenyl, aroclor 1254, chlorinated hydrocarbon, insecticide, lindane, pollutant, polychlorinated biphenyl, behavioral response, foraging behavior, grooming, HCH, honeybee, PCB, persistent organic pollutant, pollution effect, pollution exposure, sublethal effect, animal behavior, Article, centrifugation, controlled study, environmental exposure, flying, foraging behavior, grooming, honeybee, hyperactivity, molecular dynamics, multivariate analysis of variance, muscle spasm, nonhuman, stationary, toxicokinetics, upside down, walking, animal, animal behavior, bee, drug effects, physiology, pollutant, toxicity, Apis mellifera, Animals, Bees, Behavior, Animal, Chlorodiphenyl (54% Chlorine), Environmental Pollutants, Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated, Insecticides, Lindane, Polychlorinated Biphenyls	2017-01-01
Honey bee deformed wing virus structures reveal that conformational changes accompany genome release	The picornavirus-like deformed wing virus (DWV) has been directly linked to colony collapse; however, little is known about the mechanisms of host attachment or entry for DWV or its molecular and structural details. Here we report the three-dimensional (3-D) structures of DWV capsids isolated from infected honey bees, including the immature procapsid, the genome-filled virion, the putative entry intermediate (A-particle), and the empty capsid that remains after genome release. The capsids are decorated by large spikes around the 5-fold vertices. The 5-fold spikes had an open flower-like conformation for the procapsid and genome-filled capsids, whereas the putative A-particle and empty capsids that had released the genome had a closed tube-like spike conformation. Between the two conformations, the spikes undergo a significant hinge-like movement that we predicted using a Robetta model of the structure comprising the spike. We conclude that the spike structures likely serve a function during host entry, changing conformation to release the genome, and that the genome may escape from a 5-fold vertex to initiate infection. Finally, the structures illustrate that, similarly to picornaviruses, DWV forms alternate particle conformations implicated in assembly, host attachment, and RNA release. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.		capsid protein, protein VP2, protein VP4, viral protein, adult, amino terminal sequence, Article, carboxy terminal sequence, conformational transition, controlled study, deformed wing virus, female, gene loss, honeybee, image processing, image reconstruction, nonhuman, Picornaviridae, priority journal, protein assembly, protein cleavage, protein conformation, sequence alignment, three dimensional imaging, virus attachment, virus capsid, virus entry, amino acid sequence, animal, bee, chemistry, genetics, insect virus, metabolism, molecular model, physiology, Picornaviridae, ultrastructure, virion, virology, virus capsid, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Bees, Capsid, Insect Viruses, Models, Molecular, Picornaviridae, Protein Conformation, Viral Proteins, Virion	2017-01-01
Longevity extension of worker honey bees (Apis mellifera) by royal jelly: Optimal dose and active ingredient	In the Western honey bee, Apis mellifera, queens and workers have different longevity although they share the same genome. Queens consume royal jelly (RJ) as the main food throughout their life, including as adults, but workers only eat worker jelly when they are larvae less than 3 days old. In order to explore the effect of RJ and the components affecting longevity of worker honey bees, we first determined the optimal dose for prolonging longevity of workers as 4% RJ in 50% sucrose solution, and developed a method of obtaining long lived workers. We then compared the effects of longevity extension by RJ 4% with bee-collected pollen from rapeseed (Brassica napus). Lastly, we determined that a water soluble RJ protein obtained by precipitation with 60% ammonium sulfate (RJP60) contained the main component for longevity extension after comparing the effects of RJ crude protein extract (RJCP), RJP30 (obtained by precipitation with 30% ammonium sulfate), and RJ ethanol extract (RJEE). Understanding what regulates worker longevity has potential to help increase colony productivity and improve crop pollination efficiency. © 2017 Yang et al.		ammonium sulfate, bovine serum albumin, royal jelly, royal jelly crude protein extract, sucrose, unclassified drug, water, Apis mellifera, Article, high performance liquid chromatography, honey, longevity, nonhuman, optimal drug dose, pollen, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, protein analysis, rapeseed, shelf life, survival rate	2017-01-01
Value of neonicotinoid seed treatments to US soybean farmers	BACKGROUND: The benefits of neonicotinoid seed treatment to soybean farmers have received increased scrutiny. Rather than use data from small-plot experiments, this research uses survey data from 500 US farmers to estimate the benefit of neonicotinoid seed treatments to them. As seed treatment users, farmers are familiar with their benefits in the field and have economic incentives to only use them if they provide value. RESULTS: Of the surveyed farmers, 51% used insecticide seed treatments, averaging 87% of their soybean area. Farmers indicated that human and environmental safety is an important consideration affecting their pest management decisions and reported aphids as the most managed and important soybean pest. Asking farmers who used seed treatments to state how much value they provided gives an estimate of $US 28.04 ha−1 treated in 2013, net of seed treatment costs. Farmer-reported average yields provided an estimated average yield gain of 128.0 kg ha−1 treated in 2013, or about $US 42.20 ha−1 treated, net of seed treatment costs. CONCLUSION: These estimates using different data and methods are consistent and suggest the value of insecticide seed treatments to the US soybean farmers who used them in 2013 was around $US 28–42 ha−1 treated, net of seed treatment costs. ï¿½ 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. ï¿½ 2016 Society of Chemical Industry		aphid, crop pest, data acquisition, insecticide, neonicotinoid pesticide, pest control, seed treatment, soybean, United States, Aphididae, Aphis glycines, Glycine max, anabasine, insecticide, agricultural worker, cost benefit analysis, economics, pest control, plant seed, soybean, Anabasine, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Farmers, Insecticides, Pest Control, Seeds, Soybeans	2017-01-01
Risks and benefits of the biological interface between managed and wild bee pollinators	Increasing global human populations and climate change not only increase the demand for food but require it to be supplied in sustainable quantities. One crucial aspect for sustainability is to ensure pollinator services for crop production and ecosystem services. The global distribution of universal bee pollinators and the different degrees of intensity of bee-keeping have resulted in a high variability of impacts. It is therefore essential to separate the different pollinator populations, in particular the cases of honeybees and bumblebees, into wild/feral and managed populations, which can and will interact. Such interactions can be either beneficial or deleterious. A deleterious interaction between wild/feral colonies and the managed populations may result in disease and pest transmission. However, a wild/feral population could easily buffer the effects of newly introduced pathogens increasing the resistance of the population as a whole. Varroa mites that caused the loss of the wild population of Apis mellifera in Europe have recently been established in South Africa. Studies of the mite's introduction into South Africa suggest that African honeybee populations are less affected by the mite and can deal with and survive parasite loads which would kill colonies in the Northern Hemisphere. This observed resilience in Africa and Americas is most likely based on the interactions between wild and managed bees, since a large proportion of the total honeybee population is wild in these regions and therefore not influenced by humans. This allows the wild population to adapt to new parasites/pathogens, without human interference, with the large numbers of wild colonies ensuring that resilience is high. A high ratio of wild to managed colonies could also ensure that beneficial adaptations in the wild population filter through to the managed population. Whether a similar situation prevails in bumblebees with wild and managed populations needs to be more carefully examined, particularly in the context of the global trade in colonies of these bees. Our current understanding of the interaction between wild/feral and managed populations suggests that transporting of species out of their endemic range should be done with great caution.

Quantifying exposure of wild bumblebees to mixtures of agrochemicals in agricultural and urban landscapes	The increased use of pesticides has caused concern over the possible direct association of exposure to combinations of these compounds with bee health problems. There is growing proof that bees are regularly exposed to mixtures of agrochemicals, but most research has been focused on managed bees living in farmland, whereas little is known about exposure of wild bees, both in farmland and urban habitats. To determine exposure of wild bumblebees to pesticides in agricultural and urban environments through the season, specimens of five different species were collected from farms and ornamental urban gardens in three sampling periods. Five neonicotinoid insecticides, thirteen fungicides and a pesticide synergist were analysed in each of the specimens collected. In total, 61% of the 150 individuals tested had detectable levels of at least one of the compounds, with boscalid being the most frequently detected (35%), followed by tebuconazole (27%), spiroxamine (19%), carbendazim (11%), epoxiconazole (8%), imidacloprid (7%), metconazole (7%) and thiamethoxam (6%). Quantifiable concentrations ranged from 0.17 to 54.4ï¿½ng/g (bee body weight) for individual pesticides. From all the bees where pesticides were detected, the majority (71%) had more than one compound, with a maximum of seven pesticides detected in one specimen. Concentrations and detection frequencies were higher in bees collected from farmland compared to urban sites, and pesticide concentrations decreased through the season. Overall, our results show that wild bumblebees are exposed to multiple pesticides when foraging in agricultural and urban landscapes. Such mixtures are detected in bee tissues not just during the crop flowering period, but also later in the season. Therefore, contact with these combinations of active compounds might be more prolonged in time and widespread in the environment than previously assumed. These findings may help to direct future research and pesticide regulation strategies to promote the conservation of wild bee populations. ï¿½ 2017 Elsevier Ltd		Agricultural chemicals, Agriculture, Farms, Fungicides, Insecticides, Mixtures, Pesticides, Detection frequency, Neonicotinoid insecticides, Neonicotinoids, Pesticide concentrations, Pesticide exposure, Pesticide mixture, Urban environments, Wild bumblebees, Urban growth, agricultural chemical, boscalid, carbendazim, epoxiconazole, fungicide, imidacloprid, metconazole, neonicotinoid, pesticide, spiroxamine, tebuconazole, thiamethoxam, unclassified drug, agricultural chemical, fungicide, insecticide, nitro derivative, agrochemical, bee, fungicide, nontarget organism, pollution effect, pollution exposure, quantitative analysis, agricultural land, animal experiment, Article, Bombus hortorum, Bombus lapidarius, Bombus pascuorum, Bombus pratorum, Bombus terrestris, bumblebee, chemical analysis, concentration (parameters), controlled study, environmental exposure, flowering, foraging, geographic distribution, landscape, LD50, nonhuman, population dynamics, quantitative analysis, residue analysis, seasonal variation, species comparison, species habitat, urban area, wild animal, agriculture, animal, bee, city, comparative study, drug effects, wild animal, Apoidea, Agriculture, Agrochemicals, Animals, Animals, Wild, Bees, Cities, Fungicides, Industrial, Insecticides, Nitro Compounds	2017-01-01
Cryo-electron microscopy study of the genome release of the dicistrovirus Israeli acute bee paralysis virus	Viruses of the family Dicistroviridae can cause substantial economic damage by infecting agriculturally important insects. Israeli acute bee paralysis virus (IAPV) causes honeybee colony collapse disorder in the United States. Highresolution molecular details of the genome delivery mechanism of dicistroviruses are unknown. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy analysis of IAPV virions induced to release their genomes in vitro. We determined structures of full IAPV virions primed to release their genomes to a resolution of 3.3 ï¿½ and of empty capsids to a resolution of 3.9 ï¿½. We show that IAPV does not form expanded A particles before genome release as in the case of related enteroviruses of the family Picornaviridae. The structural changes observed in the empty IAPV particles include detachment of the VP4 minor capsid proteins from the inner face of the capsid and partial loss of the structure of the N-terminal arms of the VP2 capsid proteins. Unlike the case for many picornaviruses, the empty particles of IAPV are not expanded relative to the native virions and do not contain pores in their capsids that might serve as channels for genome release. Therefore, rearrangement of a unique region of the capsid is probably required for IAPV genome release. ï¿½ 2017 American Society for Microbiology.		capsid protein, protein VP2, protein VP4, Acute bee paralysis virus, amino terminal sequence, Article, cryoelectron microscopy, in vitro study, Israeli acute bee paralysis virus, nonhuman, virion, virus capsid, virus examination, virus genome, virus morphology, virus particle, virus release, animal, bee, chemistry, Dicistroviridae, genetics, metabolism, molecular model, physiology, protein conformation, ultrastructure, virology, virus assembly, virus genome, virus uncoating, Animals, Bees, Capsid, Capsid Proteins, Cryoelectron Microscopy, Dicistroviridae, Genome, Viral, Models, Molecular, Protein Conformation, Virion, Virus Assembly, Virus Uncoating	2017-01-01
Planting of neonicotinoid-coated corn raises honey bee mortality and sets back colony development	Worldwide occurrences of honey bee colony losses have raised concerns about bee health and the sustainability of pollination-dependent crops. While multiple causal factors have been identified, seed coating with insecticides of the neonicotinoid family has been the focus of much discussion and research. Nonetheless, few studies have investigated the impacts of these insecticides under field conditions or in commercial beekeeping operations. Given that corn-seed coating constitutes the largest single use of neonicotinoid, our study compared honey bee mortality from commercial apiaries located in two different agricultural settings, i.e. corn-dominated areas and corn-free environments, during the corn planting season. Data was collected in 2012 and 2013 from 26 bee yards. Dead honey bees from five hives in each apiary were counted and collected, and samples were analyzed using a multi-residue LC-MS/MS method. Long-term effects on colony development were simulated based on a honey bee population dynamic model. Mortality survey showed that colonies located in a corn-dominated area had daily mortality counts 3.51 times those of colonies from corn crop-free sites. Chemical analyses revealed that honey bees were exposed to various agricultural pesticides during the corn planting season, but were primarily subjected to neonicotinoid compounds (54% of analysed samples contained clothianidin, and 31% contained both clothianidin and thiamethoxam). Performance development simulations performed on hive populations' show that increased mortality during the corn planting season sets back colony development and bears contributions to collapse risk but, most of all, reduces the effectiveness and value of colonies for pollination services. Our results also have implications for the numerous large-scale and worldwide-cultivated crops that currently rely on pre-emptive use of neonicotinoid seed treatments. © 2017 Samson-Robert et al.		clothianidin, neonicotinoid, thiamethoxam, Article, chemical analysis, honeybee, liquid chromatography, maize, mass spectrometry, mortality, nonhuman, organism colony, pollination, population dynamics	2017-01-01
Plant-insect interactions: The role of ecological stoichiometry	The energy budget of organisms is a primary factor used to generate hypotheses in ecosystem ecology and evolutionary theory. Therefore, previous studies have focused on the energy costs and benefits of adaptations, the efficiency of energy acquisition and investment, and energy budget limitations. The maintenance of stoichiometric balance is equally important because inconsistency between the chemical composition of the consumer's tissues and that of its food sources strongly affects the major life-history traits of the consumer and may influence the consumer's fitness and shape plant-herbivore interactions. In this short review, the framework of ecological stoichiometry is introduced, focusing on plant-insect interactions in terrestrial ecosystems. The use of the trophic stoichiometric ratio (TSR) index is presented as a useful tool for indicating the chemical elements that are scarce in food and have the potential to limit the growth and development of herbivores, thereby influencing plant - herbivorous insect interactions. As an example, the elemental composition and stoichiometry of a pollen consumer (mason bee Osmia bicornis) and its preferred pollen are compared. The growth and development of O. bicornis may be colimited by the scarcity of K, Na, and N in pollen, whereas the development of the cocoon might be colimited by the scarcity of P, Mg, K, Na, Zn, Ca, and N. A literature review of the elemental composition of pollen shows high taxonomical variability in the concentrations of bee-limiting elements. The optimized collection of pollen species based on the elemental composition may represent a strategy used by bees to overcome stoichiometric mismatches, influencing their interactions with plants. It is concluded that the dependence of life-history traits on food stoichiometry should be considered when discussing life history evolution and plant-herbivore interactions. The TSR index may serve as a convenient and powerful tool in studies investigating plant-insect interactions. © The Author(s) 2017.			2017-01-01
Assessment of pollen rewards by foraging bees	The removal of pollen by flower-visiting insects is costly to plants, not only in terms of production, but also via lost reproductive potential. Modern angiosperms have evolved various reward strategies to limit these costs, yet many plant species still offer pollen as a sole or major reward for pollinating insects. The benefits plants gain by offering pollen as a reward for pollinating are defined by the behaviour of their pollinators, some of which feed on the pollen at the flower, while others collect pollen to provision offspring. We explore how pollen impacts on the behaviour and foraging decisions of pollen-collecting bees, drawing comparisons with what is known for nectar rewards. This question is of particular interest since foraging bees typically do not eat pollen during collection, meaning the sensory pathways involved in evaluating this resource are not immediately obvious. Previous research has focussed on whether foraging bees can determine the quality of pollen sources offered by different plant species, and attempted to infer the mechanisms underpinning such evaluations, mainly through observations of collection preferences in the field More recently experimental research has started to ask whether pollen itself can mediate the detection of, and learning about, pollen sources and associated floral cues. We review advancements in the understanding of how bees forage for pollen and respond to variation in pollen quality, and discuss future directions for studying how this ancestral floral food reward shapes the behaviour of pollinating insects.

Arthropod pest control for UK oilseed rape - Comparing insecticide efficacies, side effects and alternatives	Oilseed rape (Brassica napus) is an important combinable break crop in the UK, which is largely protected from arthropod pests by insecticidal chemicals. Despite ongoing debate regarding the use of neonicotinoids, the dominant seed treatment ingredients used for this crop, there is little publicly available data comparing the efficacy of insecticides in controlling key arthropod pests or comparing the impacts on non-target species and the wider environment. To provide an insight into these matters, a UK-wide expert survey targeting agronomists and entomologists was conducted from March to June 2015. Based on the opinions of 90 respondents, an average of 20% yield loss caused by the key arthropod pests was expected to have occurred in the absence of insecticide treatments. Relatively older chemical groups were perceived to have lower efficacy for target pests than newer ones, partly due to the development of insecticide resistance. Without neonicotinoid seed treatments, a lack of good control for cabbage stem flea beetle was perceived. Wide spectrum foliar insecticide sprays were perceived to have significantly greater negative impacts than seed treatments on users' health, natural enemies, pollinators, soil and water, and many foliar active ingredients have had potential risks for non-target arthropod species in UK oilseed rape fields for the past 25 years. Overall, 72% of respondents opposed the neonicotinoid restriction, while 10% supported it. Opposition and support of the restriction were largely based on concerns for pollinators and the wider environment, highlighting the uncertainty over the side effects of neonicotinoid use. More people from the government and research institutes leaned towards neutrality over the issue, compared to those directly involved in growing the crop. Neonicotinoid restriction was expected to result in greater effort and expenditure on pest control and lower production (0-1 t/ha less). Alternatives for future oilseed rape protection were then discussed. © 2017 Zhang et al.

Larval exposure to field-realistic concentrations of clothianidin has no effect on development rate, over-winter survival or adult metabolic rate in a solitary bee, Osmia bicornis	There is widespread concern regarding the effects of agro-chemical exposure on bee health, of which neonicotinoids, systemic insecticides detected in the pollen and nectar of both crops and wildflowers, have been the most strongly debated. The majority of studies examining the effect of neonicotinoids on bees have focussed on social species, namely honey bees and bumble bees. However, most bee species are solitary, their life histories differing considerably from these social species, and thus it is possible that their susceptibility to pesticides may be quite different. Studies that have included solitary bees have produced mixed results regarding the impact of neonicotinoid exposure on survival and reproductive success. While the majority of studies have focused on the effects of adult exposure, bees are also likely to be exposed as larvae via the consumption of contaminated pollen. Here we examined the effect of exposure of Osmia bicornis larvae to a range of field-realistic concentrations (0-10 ppb) of the neonicotinoid clothianidin, observing no effect on larval development time, overwintering survival or adult weight. Flow-through respirometry was used to test for latent effects of larval exposure on adult physiological function. We observed differences between male and female bees in the propensity to engage in discontinuous gas exchange; however, no effect of larval clothianidin exposure was observed. Our results suggest that previously reported adverse effects of neonicotinoids on O. bicornis are most likely mediated by impacts on adults. © 2017 Nicholls et al.		acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, neonicotinoid, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, adult, animal experiment, Article, body mass, breathing pattern, bumblebee, cocoon, controlled study, defecation, developmental stage, female, gas exchange, hatching, honeybee, humidity, larval development, limit of detection, limit of quantitation, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, male, metabolic rate, mortality rate, nonhuman, overwintering, pollen, respirometry, weight reduction	2017-01-01
Pollinators in life cycle assessment: towards a framework for impact assessment	Human activities are threatening biodiversity at an unprecedented scale and pace, thus potentially affecting also the provision of critical ecosystem services, including insect pollination. Insect pollinators play an essential functional role in terrestrial ecosystems, supporting ecological stability and food security worldwide. Therefore, assessing impact on pollinators is fundamental in any effort aiming at enhancing the environmental sustainability of human production and consumption, especially in the agri-food supply chains. Different drivers are leading to pollinator populations’ declines. Improving a supply-chain oriented assessment of the occurrence of pressure and impacts on pollinators is needed. However, current methodologies assessing impact along supply chains, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), miss to assess impact on pollinators. In fact, none of the existing life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models effectively accounts for pollinators. Some LCIA models have mentioned pollination, but none has presented key drivers of impact and a proposal for integrating pollinators as target group for biodiversity protection within an LCIA framework. In order to devise a pathway towards the inclusion of impacts on pollinators in LCIA, we conducted a literature review of environmental and anthropogenic pressures acting on insect pollinators, potentially threatening pollination services. Based on the evidence in literature, we identified and described eight potential impact drivers, primarily deriving from industrial development and intensive agricultural practice: 1) intensified land use as a result of uncontrolled expansion of urban areas and modern agricultural practices; 2) use of pesticides; 3) presence of invasive alien plants; 4) competition with invasive alien pollinator species; 5) global and local climate change; 6) spread of pests and pathogens; 7) electro-magnetic pollution and 8) genetically modified crops. To account for these drivers in LCIA, there are specific modeling needs. Hence, the current study provides recommendation on how future research should be oriented to improve the current models and how novel indicators should be developed in order to cover the existing conceptual and methodological gaps. © 2016 The Authors		Agriculture, Biodiversity, Climate change, Competition, Ecology, Ecosystems, Food supply, Genetically modified plants, Industrial plants, Land use, Supply chains, Sustainable development, Ecosystem services, Environmental sustainability, Food sector, LCIA, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Life cycle impact assessment, Pollination, Production and consumption, Life cycle	2017-01-01
Microsporidia: Obligate intracellular pathogens within the fungal kingdom	Microsporidia are obligate intracellular pathogens related to Fungi. These organisms have a unique invasion organelle, the polar tube, which upon appropriate environmental stimulation rapidly discharges out of the spore, pierces a host cell's membrane, and serves as a conduit for sporoplasm passage into the host cell. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that microsporidia are related to the Fungi, being either a basal branch or sister group. Despite the description of microsporidia over 150 years ago, we still lack an understanding of the mechanism of invasion, including the role of various polar tube proteins, spore wall proteins, and host cell proteins in the formation and function of the invasion synapse. Recent advances in ultrastructural techniques are helping to better define the formation and functioning of the invasion synapse. Over the past 2 decades, proteomic approaches have helped define polar tube proteins and spore wall proteins as well as the importance of posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation in the functioning of these proteins, but the absence of genetic techniques for the manipulation of microsporidia has hampered research on the function of these various proteins. The study of the mechanism of invasion should provide fundamental insights into the biology of these ubiquitous intracellular pathogens that can be integrated into studies aimed at treating or controlling microsporidiosis. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.

Israeli acute paralysis virus infection leads to an enhanced rna interference response and not its suppression in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris	RNA interference (RNAi) is the primary antiviral defense system in insects and its importance for pollinator health is indisputable. In this work, we examined the effect of Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) infection on the RNAi process in the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, and whether the presence of possible functional viral suppressors could alter the potency of the host’s immune response. For this, a two-fold approach was used. Through a functional RNAi assay, we observed an enhancement of the RNAi system after IAPV infection instead of its suppression, despite only minimal upregulation of the genes involved in RNAi. Besides, the presence of the proposed suppressor 1A and the predicted OrfX protein in IAPV could not be confirmed using high definition mass spectrometry. In parallel, when bumblebees were infected with cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), known to encode a suppressor of RNAi, no increase in RNAi efficiency was seen. For both viruses, pre-infection with the one virus lead to a decreased replication of the other virus, indicating a major effect of competition. These results are compelling in the context of Dicistroviridae in multi-virus/multi-host networks as the effect of a viral infection on the RNAi machinery may influence subsequent virus infections. ï¿½ 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.		green fluorescent protein, Article, Bombus terrestris, chromatography by mobile phase, comparative study, controlled study, fat pad, gene expression assay, Israeli acute paralysis virus, mass spectrometry, mortality, nonhuman, open reading frame, polymerase chain reaction, receptor upregulation, RNA extraction, RNA interference, sequence analysis, time of flight mass spectrometry, animal, bee, Dicistroviridae, host pathogen interaction, immunology, physiology, virology, virus interference, virus replication, Animals, Bees, Dicistroviridae, Host-Pathogen Interactions, RNA Interference, Viral Interference, Virus Replication	2016-12-19
Bumble bees regulate their intake of essential protein and lipid pollen macronutrients	Bee population declines are linked to the reduction of nutritional resources due to land-use intensification, yet we know little about the specific nutritional needs of many bee species. Pollen provides bees with their primary source of protein and lipids, but nutritional quality varies widely among host-plant species. Therefore, bees might have adapted to assess resource quality and adjust their foraging behavior to balance nutrition from multiple food sources. We tested the ability of two bumble bee species, Bombus terrestris and Bombus impatiens, to regulate protein and lipid intake. We restricted B. terrestris adults to single synthetic diets varying in protein:lipid ratios (P:L). The bees over-ate protein on low-fat diets and over-ate lipid on high-fat diets to reach their targets of lipid and protein, respectively. The bees survived best on a 10:1 P:L diet; the risk of dying increased as a function of dietary lipid when bees ate diets with lipid contents greater than 5:1 P:L. Hypothesizing that the P:L intake target of adult worker bumble bees was between 25:1 and 5:1, we presented workers from both species with unbalanced but complementary paired diets to determine whether they self-select their diet to reach a specific intake target. Bees consumed similar amounts of proteins and lipids in each treatment and averaged a 14:1 P:L for B. terrestris and 12:1 P:L for B. impatiens. These results demonstrate that adult worker bumble bees likely select foods that provide them with a specific ratio of P:L. These P:L intake targets could affect pollen foraging in the field and help explain patterns of host-plant species choice by bumble bees. © 2016 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.		fat intake, lipid, protein intake, animal, bee, bioassay, chemistry, diet, drug effects, fat intake, feeding behavior, metabolism, pharmacology, physiology, pollen, proportional hazards model, protein intake, survival analysis, Animals, Bees, Biological Assay, Diet, Dietary Fats, Dietary Proteins, Feeding Behavior, Lipids, Pollen, Proportional Hazards Models, Survival Analysis	2016-12-15
Prevalence of bee viruses among Apis cerana populations in Vietnam	We studied the prevalence and distribution of seven honey bee viruses, namely: acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV); cloudy wing virus (CWV); Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV); Kashmir bee virus (KBV); sacbrood virus (SBV); black queen cell virus (BQCV); and deformed wing virus (DWV), in healthy colonies from ten provinces in Vietnam. Colonies from each apiary were randomly selected to check viral infection. To confirm virus infection, samples were tested by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction using specific primer pairs. The positive products were sequenced and compared with the reference sequences using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for molecular confirmation. In 360 Apis cerana samples, we found that the most prevalent virus was SBV (in 18.33% of samples), followed by BQCV (6.11%) and DWV (3.33%). The other four viruses, ABPV, CWV, IAPV, and KBV, were not detected in any sample. Infection rates were higher in adult bees than in larvae. The prevalences of SBV, BQCV, and DWV were 25.00, 10.56, and 6.11% in adult bees, and 11.67, 1.11, and 0.56% in larvae, respectively. The occurrence of BQCV and DWV varied across geographic regions. BQCV occurred mainly in the northern provinces, while DWV was predominant in the southern provinces. SBV, however, was found in all sampled provinces and exhibited similar infection rates. In adult bees, co-infection rates of BQCV with SBV or DWV were 2.22 and 0.60%, respectively. © 2016 International Bee Research Association.			2016-12-05
Epidemiology, risk factors and varroa mite control in the Estonian honey bee population	This is the first large scale study demonstrating the status of varroa infestation and control and related risk factors in Estonian apiaries. Colonies in one hundred and ninety-six apiaries were sampled during 2012–2013. A questionnaire was used to record management, as well as treatment procedures applied. The majority of apiaries sampled (98.5, 95% CI = 95.6; 99.7%) were infested with varroa mites and the mean proportion of affected colonies within apiaries was high (78.9, 95% CI 77.2; 80.6%). Apiary median colony infestation level was 2 mites per 300 bees (mean 4.5, range 0–25). According to multivariable random-effect logistic regression analysis, the numbers of colonies in an apiary (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.01; 1.06, p = 0.004) and the presence of a hybrid breed of bees (OR = 2.22, 95% CI 0.88; 5.61, p = 0.093) were associated with higher risk of colony varroa infestation. Apiary management by a professional beekeeper (OR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.15; 0.97, p = 0.044), bees of the Buckfast breed (OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.11; 1.13, p = 0.079), synchronized treatments between neighboring beekeepers (OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.16; 0.68, p = 0.003) and the presence of farmland around the apiary (OR = 0.29, 95% CI 0.09; 0.95, p = 0.041) were factors protective against colony varroa infestation. Varroa treatment was applied in 93% of the studied apiaries.

Floral diversity of pollen collected by honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) - validation of the chromatic assessment method	Pollen collected from flowers by forager bees is the only natural protein source for the hive. This nutritional compound is fundamental for the nurse bee and brood development, and for the queen activity. Pollen has a strong influence on colony health. It is also known that the pollen quality, in terms of the amino acid profile and total protein content, varies significantly according to the floral origin. For this reason, the palynological diversity assessed in corbicular pollen is a good measure of the quality of the environment the bees live in, in terms of available food. An international research initiative “C.S.I. Pollen” aims to elaborate a pollen diversity map for all of Europe, carried out by beekeepers. Chromatic assessment of pellet colours will be used as a method. In our study, we wanted to validate this idea, through the comparison between the two methods: chromatic assessment of the diversity of pollen pellet colours and palynological assessment of the real pollen type diversity. In other words, we wanted to verify whether the pellet-colour profile reflects the palynological one. We found a significant correlation between results obtained from the two methods but some improvements are also proposed in order to increase the determination coefficient and to reduce the differences given by the two answers. ï¿½ 2016, Research Inst Pomology Floriculture.

Evaluation of oregano (Lippia berlandieri) essential oil and Entomopathogenic Fungi for Varroa destructor<sup>1</sup> control in colonies of honey bee, Apis mellifera<sup>2</sup>	Potential of organic compounds to control Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman, on honey bee, Apis mellifera L. colonies was evaluated at Cuauhtémoc, Chihuahua, México (28°26′53″N, 106°49′46″W). Treatments were 1.16, 1.33, and 1.50 ml of oregano pure oil (carvacrol 60%); a mixture of oregano oil (7, 8, and 9% carvacrol) with canola oil (v/v); and as a biological control agent, native strains of Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae (108 CFU/g). The efficacy of organic compounds and biological agents was compared with that of amitraz (1%) to eliminate mites from infested colonies of honey bees. In two assays, amitraz was significantly (P < 0.01) the most effective acaricide, with a mean efficacy of 97% in eliminating V. destructor from infested honey bee colonies. However, the most effective organic compound after amitraz in killing V. destructor was 1.16 and 1.5 ml of oregano pure oil, with efficacies of 57 to 74% (P < 0.01). Results suggested that oregano pure oil should be considered a viable alternative to synthetic acaricides for controlling V. destructor in honey bee colonies. The amount of carvacrol in honey produced by bees treated with oregano essential oil did not exceed the taste detection threshold of 0.1 ppm, and therefore, did not pose a risk of taste modification of natural honey.			2016-12-01
Multi-residue analysis of pesticide residues in crude pollens by UPLC-MS/MS	A multi-residue method for the determination of 54 pesticide residues in pollens has been developed and validated. The proposed method was applied to the analysis of 48 crude pollen samples collected from eight provinces of China. The recovery of analytes ranged from 60% to 136% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) below 30%. Of the 54 targeted compounds, 19 pesticides were detected. The major detection rates of each compound were 77.1% for carbendazim, 58.3% for fenpropathrin, 56.3% for chlorpyrifos, 50.0% for fluvalinate, 31.3% for chlorbenzuron, and 29.2% for triadimefon in crude pollen samples. The maximum values of each pesticide were 4516 ng/g for carbendazim, 162.8 ng/g for fenpropathrin, 176.6 ng/g for chlorpyrifos, 316.2 ng/g for fluvalinate, 437.2 ng/g for chlorbenzuron, 79.00 ng/g for triadimefon, and so on. This study provides basis for the research on the risks to honeybee health. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.			2016-12-01
Sublethal effects of imidacloprid on honey bee colony growth and activity at three sites in the U.S.	Imidacloprid is a neonicotinoid pesticide heavily used by the agricultural industry and shown to have negative impacts on honey bees above certain concentrations. We evaluated the effects of different imidacloprid concentrations in sugar syrup using cage and field studies, and across different environments. Honey bee colonies fed sublethal concentrations of imidicloprid (0, 5, 20 and 100 ppb) over 6 weeks in field trials at a desert site (Arizona), a site near intensive agriculture (Arkansas) and a site with little nearby agriculture but abundant natural forage (Mississippi) were monitored with respect to colony metrics, such as adult bee and brood population sizes, as well as pesticide residues. Hive weight and internal hive temperature were monitored continuously over two trials in Arizona. Colonies fed 100 ppb imidacloprid in Arizona had significantly lower adult bee populations, brood surface areas and average frame weights, and reduced temperature control, compared to colonies in one or more of the other treatment groups, and consumption rates of those colonies were lower compared to other colonies in Arizona and Arkansas, although no differences in capped brood or average frame weight were observed among treatments in Arkansas. At the Mississippi site, also rich in alternative forage, colonies fed 5 ppb imidacloprid had less capped brood than control colonies, but contamination of control colonies was detected. In contrast, significantly higher daily hive weight variability among colonies fed 5 ppb imidacloprid in Arizona suggested greater foraging activity during a nectar flow post treatment, than any other treatment group. Imidacloprid concentrations in stored honey corresponded well with the respective syrup concentrations fed to the colonies and remained stable within the hive for at least 7 months after the end of treatment. ï¿½ This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Sepsis and hemocyte loss in honey bees (Apis mellifera) Infected with serratia marcescens strain sicaria	Global loss of honey bee colonies is threatening the human food supply. Diverse pathogens reduce honey bee hardiness needed to sustain colonies, especially in winter. We isolated a free-living Gram negative bacillus from hemolymph of worker honey bees (Apis mellifera) found separated from winter clusters. In some hives, greater than 90% of the dying bees detached from the winter cluster were found to contain this bacterium in their hemolymph. Throughout the year, the same organism was rarely found in bees engaged in normal hive activities, but was detected in about half of Varroa destructor mites obtained from colonies that housed the septic bees. Flow cytometry of hemolymph from septic bees showed a significant reduction of plasmatocytes and other types of hemocytes. Interpretation of the16S rRNA sequence of the bacterium indicated that it belongs to the Serratia genus of Gramnegative Gammaproteobacteria, which has not previously been implicated as a pathogen of adult honey bees. Complete genome sequence analysis of the bacterium supported its classification as a novel strain of Serratia marcescens, which was designated as S. marcescens strain sicaria (Ss1). When compared with other strains of S. marcescens, Ss1 demonstrated several phenotypic and genetic differences, including 65 genes not previously found in other Serratia genomes. Some of the unique genes we identified in Ss1 were related to those from bacterial insect pathogens and commensals. Recovery of this organism extends a complex pathosphere of agents which may contribute to failure of honey bee colonies. © 2016 Burritt et al.

How landscape, pollen intake and pollen quality affect colony growth in Bombus terrestris	Context: Abundance and diversity of bumblebees have been declining over the past decades. To successfully conserve bumblebee populations, we need to understand how landscape characteristics affect the quantity and quality of floral resources collected by colonies and subsequently colony performance. Objectives: We therefore investigated how amount and composition of pollen collected by buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris colonies was affected by the surrounding landscape (i.e. the proportion of forest, urban, semi-natural habitats) and how they were related to colony growth. Methods: Thirty B. terrestris colonies were placed at grassland sites differing in surrounding landscape. Colonies were established in spring when availability of flowering plants was highest, and their weight gain was monitored for 1 month. We additionally recorded the quantity and compared plant taxonomic composition and nutritional quality (i.e. amino acid composition) of pollen stored. Results: Bumblebee colonies varied little in the pollen spectra collected despite differences in surrounding landscape composition. They collected on average 80 % of pollen from woody plants, with 34 % belonging to the genus Acer. Early colony growth positively correlated with total amount of woody pollen and protein collected and decreased with increasing proportions of semi-natural habitats and total amino acid concentrations. Conclusions: Our results suggest that woody plant species represent highly important pollen sources for the generalist forager B. terrestris early in the season. We further show that colony growth of B. terrestris is predominantly affected by the quantity, not quality, of forage, indicating that several abundant plant species flowering throughout the bumblebees’ foraging season may cover the colonies’ nutritional needs. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.		amino acid, bee, floral trait, food intake, foraging behavior, generalist, landscape structure, nutritional status, plant-pollinator interaction, pollen, protein, shrub, taxonomy, Acer, Bombus terrestris, Magnoliophyta	2016-12-01
Levels of selected persistent organic pollutants (PCB, PBDE) and pesticides in honey bee pollen sampled in Poland	Chemical plant protection is a commonly discussed factor potentially responsible for decline in pollinators and other beneficial insect populations. Various groups of chemicals including persistent organic pollutants could impact a bee colony's welfare and are reported to be present in bee tissue and apiary products. The aim of this work was to evaluate the presence of selected persistent organic pollutant and pesticide residues in bee pollen originating from different geographical regions of Poland. Pesticide residues were identified in 60% of tested bee pollen samples. The compounds identified were mainly active ingredients of fungicide preparations. Insecticide active ingredients were up to 30% of the identified residues. The triazole fungicide tebuconazole and the neonicotinoid insecticide thiacloprid were the most frequently found pesticides in pollen. The highest pesticide concentration was determined for prothioconazole (356 μg kg-1). Mean concentrations of chlorinated biphenyls-EC6 and EC12 were 194 pg g-1 and 74 pg g-1, respectively. CB # 28 has the greatest share in the EC6 profile (mean 61 pg g-1, 31% contribution). Relatively high contributions were also observed for CBs # 101 (35 pg g-1, 18%), # 138 (36 pg g-1, 19%) and # 153 (33 pg g-1, 17%). CB # 114 and 118 have the highest share in the dioxin-like biphenyls fraction with mean concentrations of 17.6 and 37.6 pg g-1 (respectively 23 and 50%). Mean calculated concentrations of 39 polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners (∑39 BDE) were 20 - 27.7 pg g-1. High variability was observed between maximal and minimal determined concentration values. Individual BDEs were found at different frequencies and varying concentration levels. BDEs # 47, 75 and 99 dominated the profile with average concentrations of 3 pg g-1, 3.1 pg g-1, and 2.9 pg g-1, respectively. © 2016 Roszko et al.

Differential gene expression in Varroa jacobsoni mites following a host shift to European honey bees (Apis mellifera)	Background: Varroa mites are widely considered the biggest honey bee health problem worldwide. Until recently, Varroa jacobsoni has been found to live and reproduce only in Asian honey bee (Apis cerana) colonies, while V. destructor successfully reproduces in both A. cerana and A. mellifera colonies. However, we have identified an island population of V. jacobsoni that is highly destructive to A. mellifera, the primary species used for pollination and honey production. The ability of these populations of mites to cross the host species boundary potentially represents an enormous threat to apiculture, and is presumably due to genetic variation that exists among populations of V. jacobsoni that influences gene expression and reproductive status. In this work, we investigate differences in gene expression between populations of V. jacobsoni reproducing on A. cerana and those either reproducing or not capable of reproducing on A. mellifera, in order to gain insight into differences that allow V. jacobsoni to overcome its normal species tropism. Results: We sequenced and assembled a de novo transcriptome of V. jacobsoni. We also performed a differential gene expression analysis contrasting biological replicates of V. jacobsoni populations that differ in their ability to reproduce on A. mellifera. Using the edgeR, EBSeq and DESeq R packages for differential gene expression analysis, we found 287 differentially expressed genes (FDR ≤ 0.05), of which 91% were up regulated in mites reproducing on A. mellifera. In addition, mites found reproducing on A. mellifera showed substantially more variation in expression among replicates. We searched for orthologous genes in public databases and were able to associate 100 of these 287 differentially expressed genes with a functional description. Conclusions: There is differential gene expression between the two mite groups, with more variation in gene expression among mites that were able to reproduce on A. mellifera. A small set of genes showed reduced expression in mites on the A. mellifera host, including putative transcription factors and digestive tract developmental genes. The vast majority of differentially expressed genes were up-regulated in this host. This gene set showed enrichment for genes associated with mitochondrial respiratory function and apoptosis, suggesting that mites on this host may be experiencing higher stress, and may be less optimally adapted to parasitize it. Some genes involved in reproduction and oogenesis were also overexpressed, which should be further studied in regards to this host shift. © 2016 The Author(s).		transcriptome, arthropod protein, RNA, transcriptome, adult, Apis cerana, Apis mellifera, apoptosis, Article, cell function, controlled study, down regulation, female, gene cluster, gene expression, gene expression regulation, gene number, gene replication, gene sequence, genetic analysis, genetic association, genetic parameters, genetic variation, host parasite interaction, nonhuman, oocyte development, RNA extraction, RNA sequence, sequence alignment, transcriptome assembly, tropism, upregulation, Varroa, Varroa jacobsoni, animal, bee, chemistry, cluster analysis, DNA sequence, genetic database, genetics, isolation and purification, metabolism, parasitology, physiology, Varroidae, Animals, Arthropod Proteins, Bees, Cluster Analysis, Databases, Genetic, Down-Regulation, Female, RNA, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Transcriptome, Up-Regulation, Varroidae	2016-11-16
Synthesis of Enantiopure Alicyclic Ethers and Their Activity on the Chemosensory Organ of the Ectoparasite of Honey Bees, Varroa destructor	The preparation of enantiopure conformationally restricted alicyclic ethers and their inhibitory activities on the chemosensory organ of the Varroa destructor, a parasite of honey bees, are reported in this article. We tested the effect of enantiopure ethers of cis-5-(2′-hydroxyethyl)cyclopent-2-en-1-ol on the Varroa chemosensory organ by electrophysiology, for their ability to inhibit the responses to two honey bee-produced odors that are important for the mite to locate its host: nurse bee head space odor and (E)-β-ocimene, a honey bee brood pheromone. Previous work with the racemic compounds showed that they suppress the mite's olfactory response to its bee host, which led to incorrect host choice. Based on a structure-activity relationship, we predicted that the two most active compounds - cis-1-butoxy-5-(2′-methoxyethyl)cyclopent-2-ene, cy{4,1}, and (cis-1-ethoxy-5-(2′ethoxyethyl)cyclopent-2-ene, cy{2,2} - could have opposite active enantiomers. Here we studied the enantiomers of both ethers, whose preparation involved enzymatic resolution of racemic diol cis-5-(2′-hydroxyethyl)cyclopent-2-en-1-ol using Lipase AK with vinyl acetate. The racemic diol was prepared from commercially available 2,5-norbornadiene. We observed that the responses of the chemosensory organ to honey bee head space volatiles were significantly decreased by both enantiomers of cy{4,1} and cy{2,2}, but that responses to (E)-β-ocimene were decreased significantly only by (+)-cy{4,1} (1R,5S) and (a)-cy{2,2} (1S,5R) and not by their respective enantiomers. The importance of this result is that the racemates could be used to inhibit olfactory detection of bee odors by mites, without a loss in activity relative to the more expensive enantiopure compounds. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

Residues in Beeswax: A Health Risk for the Consumer of Honey and Beeswax?	A scenario analysis in regard to the risk of chronic exposure of consumers to residues through the consumption of contaminated honey and beeswax was conducted. Twenty-two plant protection products and veterinary substances of which residues have already been detected in beeswax in Europe were selected. The potential chronic exposure was assessed by applying a worst-case scenario based on the addition of a "maximum" daily intake through the consumption of honey and beeswax to the theoretical maximum daily intake through other foodstuffs. For each residue, the total exposure was finally compared to the acceptable daily intake. It is concluded that the food consumption of honey and beeswax contaminated with these residues considered separately does not compromise the consumer's health, provided proposed action limits are met. In regard to residues of flumethrin in honey and in beeswax, "zero tolerance" should be applied. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

Flight behaviour of honey bee (Apis mellifera) workers is altered by initial infections of the fungal parasite Nosema apis	Honey bees (Apis mellifera) host a wide range of parasites, some being known contributors towards dramatic colony losses as reported over recent years. To counter parasitic threats, honey bees possess effective immune systems. Because immune responses are predicted to cause substantial physiological costs for infected individuals, they are expected to trade off with other life history traits that ultimately affect the performance and fitness of the entire colony. Here, we tested whether the initial onset of an infection negatively impacts the flight behaviour of honey bee workers, which is an energetically demanding behaviour and a key component of foraging activities. To do this, we infected workers with the widespread fungal pathogen Nosema apis, which is recognised and killed by the honey bee immune system. We compared their survival and flight behaviour with non-infected individuals from the same cohort and colony using radio frequency identification tags (RFID). We found that over a time frame of four days post infection, Nosema did not increase mortality but workers quickly altered their flight behaviour and performed more flights of shorter duration. We conclude that parasitic infections influence foraging activities, which could reduce foraging ranges of colonies and impact their ability to provide pollination services. © The Author(s) 2016.			2016-11-09
Queen replacement: the key to prevent winter colony losses in Argentina	Honey bee colony losses during winter are a multi-factorial phenomenon. Environmental conditions, beekeeping practices and different pathogens are all considered as potential causes of honey bee colony losses. However, these factors may be diverse in different regions and there are no regional studies about winter losses in South America. The objective of this study was to identify risks factors associated with winter losses in temperate climate honey bee colonies in Argentina. Parasitic mite infestation level, colony strength measures, and percentage of colonies losses during winter 2013 were evaluated in 62 apiaries distributed in four different regions in east-central Argentina. Data regarding management practices in each apiary were collected by means of a questionnaire. A logistic regression model was constructed to associate management variables with the risk of winter losses higher than 10% of the colonies. Beekeepers who reported replacing less than 50% of the queens in their apiaries showed higher winter losses than apiaries who replaced more than 50% of their queens (OR = 18.15; CI 95%: 1.76–187.43; p = 0.01). There were no significant spatial clusters detected in our analysis (p > 0.05). Even considering that the winter colony losses can be explained by a complex interaction of factors, requeening appears as one of the most important management practices to reduce this phenomenon in Argentina. © 2016 International Bee Research Association.			2016-11-02
Identifying bacterial predictors of honey bee health	Non-targeted approaches are useful tools to identify new or emerging issues in bee health. Here, we utilise next generation sequencing to highlight bacteria associated with healthy and unhealthy honey bee colonies, and then use targeted methods to screen a wider pool of colonies with known health status. Our results provide the first evidence that bacteria from the genus Arsenophonus are associated with poor health in honey bee colonies. We also discovered Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc spp. were associated with healthier honey bee colonies. Our results highlight the importance of understanding how the wider microbial population relates to honey bee colony health. © 2016		bacterial RNA, animal, bee, high throughput sequencing, microbiology, polymerase chain reaction, Animals, Bees, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, Polymerase Chain Reaction, RNA, Bacterial	2016-11-01
Honey bee colony losses: What's happening in South America?	The concerns for the effects of honey bee declines have spurred several large-scale surveys of honey bee health around the world to evaluate potential drivers of colony losses. United States and Europe already have well developed honey bee surveys, however, no large-scale survey has yet been developed in South America. In this paper, we present such an initiative of a national survey of honey bee health in Argentina, which hosts the largest population of managed honey bee colonies in South America. It is also one of the top honey-producing countries in the world. We developed a volunteer-based survey using a standardized questionnaire and distributed it to a national network of beekeepers. The rapid mobilization and support from beekeepers shows an interest in and a need for this type of national survey. We call for help from the readers of American Bee Journal to improve the dissemination of the questionnaire among potential interested parties in Argentina. We provide methods and recommendations to help the development of national surveys of honey bee health and also encourage such initiatives in other South American countries.			2016-11-01
Screening of pesticide residues in honeybee wax comb by LC-ESI-MS/MS. A pilot study	A developed multi-residue method using microflow-LC-ESI-QqQ-MS provided a wide-scope analysis for medium-polar and polar pesticide residues (120 compounds including breakdown products). Honeybee wax comb samples were extracted using a generic QuEChERS based procedure. Acceptable recoveries at concentration levels of 5 and 50 μg kg−1 were within the 70–120% range with an associated precision RSD <20%. The LOQ values were mostly 5 μg kg−1 for almost all pesticides. Aprox. 31 of 120 LC-amenable pesticides tested (25.8%) were detected in a pilot study of 60 samples. Pesticide residues detected using the proposed method were: the breakdown products of amitraz, DMPF and DMF, an acaricide used for Varroa mite control, with a range of concentration from 5 to 464 μg kg−1 (sum of DMPF + DMF), organophosphate insecticides from 1 to 464 μg kg−1, acaricides at concentrations > 9 μg kg−1; fungicides at concentrations ranging from 1 to 23 μg kg−1. The number of positive detections due to herbicides was lower as expected and at a lower level of concentration, from 1 to 5.9 μg kg−1. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd		Trace analysis, Breakdown products, Concentration levels, Honeybee wax comb, LC-Amenable compounds, LC-MS/MS, Multiresidue method, Organophosphate insecticides, Pesticide residue, Pesticides, acaricide, acetamiprid, amitraz, azinphos methyl, carbaril, carbendazim, clofentezine, clothianidin, cyprodinil, cyromazine, dichlorvos, dicrotophos, difenoconazole, dimethoate, dimethyl sulfone, dimpylate, epoxiconazole, ethion, ethoprop, fenamiphos, fenoxycarb, fenpropimorph, fipronil, formetanate, fungicide, herbicide, neonicotinoid, pesticide residue, profenofos, propolis, pesticide residue, propolis, wax, cells and cell components, chemical control, concentration (composition), extraction method, honeybee, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, mite, pesticide residue, trace element, animal experiment, Article, comb, concentration (parameters), controlled study, dilution, electrospray mass spectrometry, honeybee, liquid chromatography, measurement accuracy, nonhuman, pilot study, reduction, screening test, tandem mass spectrometry, Varroa, analysis, animal, bee, electrospray mass spectrometry, honey, liquid chromatography, metabolism, procedures, tandem mass spectrometry, Acari, Apis mellifera, Varroa, Animals, Bees, Chromatography, Liquid, Honey, Pesticide Residues, Pilot Projects, Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization, Tandem Mass Spectrometry, Waxes	2016-11-01
Combined effect of pollen quality and thiamethoxam on hypopharyngeal gland development and protein content in Apis mellifera	Pollen diet is essential to nurse bees to develop hypopharyngeal glands (HPGs) and produce royal jelly to feed larvae. The effect of different diet regimes combined with pesticide exposure on the development of HPGs in honeybees was studied. In particular, a high-quality pollen mixture (high pollen diversity and protein content) and a low-quality diet (low pollen diversity and protein content) were combined with the chronic administration of thiamethoxam (10 and 40ï¿½μg/L). The impact of these stressors was evaluated by measuring the size of HPG acini and the total protein content of bee heads in 8- and 12-day-old bees. Bees fed with sub-lethal concentrations of thiamethoxam and with the low-quality diet exhibited smaller and irregularly shaped acini. The total protein content in bee head was also affected by pesticide administration, while the pollen quality did not cause significant modifications. In conclusion, these results highlighted the importance of the food quality, considered as nutritional value and pesticide contamination, for the physiological development of honeybees. ï¿½ 2016, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		concentration (composition), developmental biology, diet, ecotoxicology, food quality, honeybee, insecticide, neonicotinoid pesticide, pollen, pollution exposure, protein, sublethal effect, toxicity test, Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2016-11-01
Haplotype identification and detection of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in Varroa destructor mites using ARMS and PCR–RFLP methods	In the present study, amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) and polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) methods were used for identification of recently described Serbia 1 (S1) and Peshter 1 (P1) mitochondrial haplotypes of Varroa destructor. Based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within cytochrome oxidase 1 (cox1) and cytochrome b (cytb) gene sequences, a total of 64 adult V. destructor females were analyzed from locations where the S1 and P1 haplotypes had been detected previously. Results of haplotype identification obtained by ARMS and PCR–RFLP methods were completely consistent with the sequencing data. Furthermore, in some analyzed samples the occurrence of site heteroplasmy at haplotype-defining sites was detected, as it was confirmed by double peaks in the sequence chromatograms. Neither mites with simultaneous nucleotide variability, nor those with combined SNP and heteroplasmy in cox1 and cytb were found. Given that this is the first occurrence of site heteroplasmy in V. destructor, the origin of this phenomenon and possible specific traits of heteroplasmic mites have yet to be determined. ï¿½ 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.		genetic analysis, genetic marker, mite, mitochondrial DNA, polymerase chain reaction, polymorphism, Acari, Varroa destructor, mitochondrial DNA, animal, DNA sequence, economics, female, genetics, haplotype, nucleic acid amplification, polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment length polymorphism, Serbia, Varroidae, Animals, DNA, Mitochondrial, Female, Haplotypes, Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Serbia, Varroidae	2016-11-01
Honeybee health in South America	Honeybees are essential components to modern agriculture and economy. However, a continuous increase in cases of colony losses and colony depopulation are being reported worldwide. This critical situation has put the fragile equilibrium between bees and plants on the edge. As a consequence, several scientists have begun to focus their lines of research on this issue. Most researchers agree that there is no single explanation for the observed colony losses. Instead, these losses result from a synergistic interaction between different stressors. South America is not the exception; several cases of colony losses and colony depopulation were reported by beekeepers throughout the continent, yet no accurate data has been published to date. Therefore, this article attempts to analyze the past and present situation of honeybee health in South America, specifically in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, and Venezuela. Furthermore, it is intended to serve as a comparison to future colony losses, as well as to provide guidance for future hypothesis-driven research on the causes of colony mortality. We evaluate the impact of the main parasites and pathogens affecting honeybee colonies and discuss the role of each with respect to reported honeybee losses. We also contemplate the main challenges that each nation must confront with regards to honeybee health. ï¿½ 2016, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		apiculture, colonization, disequilibrium, environmental stress, honeybee, host-parasite interaction, mortality, population decline, synergism, South America, Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2016-11-01
Review of field and monitoring studies investigating the role of nitro-substituted neonicotinoid insecticides in the reported losses of honey bee colonies (Apis mellifera)	The nitro-substituted neonicotinoid insecticides, which include imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and clothianidin, are widely used to control a range of important agricultural pests both by foliar applications and also as seed dressings and by soil application. Since they exhibit systemic properties, exposure of bees may occur as a result of residues present in the nectar and/or pollen of seed- or soil-treated crop plants and so they have been the subject of much debate about whether they cause adverse effects in pollinating insects under field conditions. Due to these perceived concerns, the use of the three neonicotinoids imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam has been temporarily suspended in the European Union for seed treatment, soil application and foliar treatment in crops attractive to bees. Monitoring data from a number of countries are available to assess the presence of neonicotinoid residues in honey bee samples and possible impacts at the colony level and these are reviewed here together with a number of field studies which have looked at the impact of clothiandin on honey bees in relation to specific crop use and in particular with oilseed rape. Currently there is considerable uncertainty with regards to the regulatory testing requirements for field studies. Accordingly, a testing protocol was developed to address any acute and chronic risks from oilseed rape seeds containing a coating with 10 g clothianidin and 2 g beta-cyfluthrin per kg seeds (Eladoï¿½) for managed honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies, commercially bred bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) colonies and red mason bees (Osmia bicornis) as a representative solitary bee species.

Floral abundance and resource quality influence pollinator choice	Pollinator declines caused by forage habitat loss threaten insect pollination services. Pollinating insects depend on adequate floral resources, and their ability to track these resources. Variability of these resources and the effect on insect foraging choice is poorly understood. We record patterns of visitation to six wildflower species and test the hypotheses that: pollinators preferentially visit the most rewarding flowers; nectar diurnal variations affect foraging preferences; pollinators respond most strongly to nectar rewards. Nectar volume and sugar concentration were negatively correlated within plant species over time of day where greater concentration and lower volume was evident in the afternoon, but this did not correspond to pollinator visitation. Both floral abundance and nectar quality (total sugar per inflorescence) positively affect insect visitation. For some foragers, the positive effects of high-quality rewards were only evident when floral abundance was high (>50 inflorescences per patch), perhaps reflecting the low probability of pollinators detecting scarce rewards. Pollen quality (total protein per inflorescence) was negatively related to visitation of Apis mellifera and Bombus pascuorum. Fewer pollinators visiting flowers of higher pollen quality could reflect plant allocation trade-offs or the presence of secondary metabolites in pollen, meaning pollen foraging is likely affected by factors other than protein concentration. Nectar rather than pollen appeared to be the main driver of floral choice by insects in this system. Conservation schemes for bees in farmland or gardens might benefit from ensuring that rewarding plant species are present at high density and/or are aggregated in space. ï¿½ 2016 The Royal Entomological Society			2016-11-01
Bee pollen as a bioindicator of environmental pesticide contamination	Honeybees and bee products are potential bioindicators of the presence of contaminants in the environment, enabling monitoring of large areas due to the long distances travelled by bees. This work evaluates the use of bee pollen as a bioindicator of environmental contamination by pesticides. A GC-MS/MS analytical method for multiresidue determination of 26 different pesticides in pollen was developed and validated in accordance with the recommendations of the European Union SANCO guide. Environmental monitoring was conducted using the analysis of 145 pollen samples collected from ten beehives in the experimental apiary of Embrapa in Jaguariúna (São Paulo State, Brazil). Bioallethrin and pendimethalin were identified in four and eighteen samples, respectively, at concentrations below the LOQ of the method (25 ng g−1). Passive sampling with polyurethane foam discs was used as a control, and no pesticides were found. The detection of pesticide residues in seven samples (33%) from commercial apiaries in Ribeirão Preto (São Paulo State) confirmed the efficiency of the analytical method and the need for environmental monitoring for the presence of pesticide residues. The results demonstrated the potential of bee pollen as a bioindicator of environmental contamination by pesticides. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd		Biomarkers, Contamination, Environmental engineering, Foam control, Bee pollen, Environmental contamination, Environmental Monitoring, GC-MS/MS, Multiresidue determination, Multiresidues, Pesticide contaminations, Polyurethane Foam, Pesticides, 1,1,1 trichloro 2 (2 chlorophenyl) 2 (4 chlorophenyl)ethane, abamectin, acetochlor, alachlor, aldrin, bifenthrin, bioallethrin, chlorpyrifos methyl, disulfoton, endosulfan, fluazifop, heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene, malathion, parathion, parathion methyl, pendimethalin, permethrin, pesticide, phenthoate, phosalone, terbufos, trifluralin, allethrin, ion, pesticide, pesticide residue, pollutant, apiculture, bioindicator, concentration (composition), environmental monitoring, European Union, gas chromatography, guideline, honeybee, mass spectrometry, pesticide residue, pollen, pollution incidence, Article, contamination, controlled study, environmental monitoring, limit of quantitation, mass fragmentography, pollen, analysis, animal, bee, Brazil, calibration, chemistry, high performance liquid chromatography, limit of detection, pollen, pollutant, procedures, tandem mass spectrometry, Brazil, Jaguariuna, Sao Paulo [Brazil], Apoidea, Allethrin, Animals, Bees, Brazil, Calibration, Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid, Environmental Monitoring, Environmental Pollutants, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, Ions, Limit of Detection, Pesticide Residues, Pesticides, Pollen, Tandem Mass Spectrometry	2016-11-01
Age structure is critical to the population dynamics and survival of honeybee colonies	Age structure is an important feature of the division of labour within honeybee colonies, but its effects on colony dynamics have rarely been explored. We present a model of a honeybee colony that incorporates this key feature, and use this model to explore the effects of both winter and disease on the fate of the colony. The model offers a novel explanation for the frequently observed phenomenon of ‘spring dwindle’, which emerges as a natural consequence of the age-structured dynamics. Furthermore, the results indicate that a model taking age structure into account markedly affects the predicted timing and severity of disease within a bee colony. The timing of the onset of disease with respect to the changing seasons may also have a substantial impact on the fate of a honeybee colony. Finally, simulations predict that an infection may persist in a honeybee colony over several years, with effects that compound over time. Thus, the ultimate collapse of the colony may be the result of events several years past. ï¿½ 2016 The Authors.			2016-11-01
Beneficial microorganisms for honey bees: problems and progresses	Nowadays, honey bees are stressed by a number of biotic and abiotic factors which may compromise to some extent the pollination service and the hive productivity. The EU ban of antibiotics as therapeutic agents against bee pathogens has stimulated the search for natural alternatives. The increasing knowledge on the composition and functions of the bee gut microbiota and the link between a balanced gut microbiota and health status have encouraged the research on the use of gut microorganisms to improve bee health. Somehow, we are assisting to the transfer of the “probiotic concept” into the bee science. In this review, we examine the role of the honey bee gut microbiota in bee health and critically describe the available applications of beneficial microorganisms as pest control agents and health support. Most of the strains, mainly belonging to the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Bacillus, are isolated from honey bee crop or gut, but some applications involve environmental strains or formulation for animal and human consumption. Overall, the obtained results show the favourable effect of applied microbial strains on bee health and productivity, in particular if strains of bee origin are used. However, it is actually not yet possible to conclude whether this strategy will ever work. In particular, many aspects regarding the overall setup of the experiments, the dose, the timing and the duration of the treatment need to be optimized, also considering the microbiological safety of the hive products (i.e. pollen and honey). In addition, a deep investigation about the effect on host immunity and physiology is envisaged. Lastly, the final users of the formulations, i.e. beekeepers, should be taken into account for the achievement of high-quality, cost-effective and easy-to-use products. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Island population of European honey bees in Northeastern Brazil that have survived Varroa infestations for over 30 years	European honey bees were introduced to Fernando de Noronha Island in 1984 already infested by Varroa destructor, and since then they have survived without any control measures. In 2012, adult and brood infestation rates were measured and compared to historical records. There was no significant difference in mite levels between the values obtained in 1996 (14 mites/100 adult bees) and 2012 (16.5 mites/100 bees). The percentage of mites that reproduced in worker brood cells also was not significantly different from the data obtained in 1996. The frequency of hygienic behavior was similar to data obtained for resistant African-derived honey bees. Average fecundity decreased slightly between 1996 and 2012, but remained high. From our data, we conclude that those bees have maintained stable infestation levels for at least 16 years. Infestation rates remain high, at rates that would be fatal to honey bees in most regions of the world, but there is no Varroa-related colony mortality on the island. © 2016, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		fecundity, honeybee, hygiene, infectivity, introduced species, island biogeography, mite, mortality, natural selection, reproduction, survival, Europe, Fernando de Noronha, Pernambuco, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2016-11-01
Diet-related gut bacterial dysbiosis correlates with impaired development, increased mortality and Nosema disease in the honeybee (Apis mellifera)	Dysbiosis, defined as unhealthy shifts in bacterial community composition, can lower the colonization resistance of the gut to intrinsic pathogens. Here, we determined the effect of diet age and type on the health and bacterial community composition of the honeybee (Apis mellifera). We fed newly emerged bees fresh or aged diets, and then recorded host development and bacterial community composition from four distinct regions of the hosts’ digestive tract. Feeding fresh pollen or fresh substitute, we found no difference in host mortality, diet consumption, development or microbial community composition. In contrast, bees fed aged diets suffered impaired development, increased mortality and developed a significantly dysbiotic microbiome. The consumption of aged diets resulted in a significant reduction in the core ileum bacterium Snodgrassella alvi and a corresponding increase in intrinsic pathogen Frischella perrara. Moreover, the relative abundance of S. alvi in the ileum was positively correlated with host survival and development. The inverse was true for both F. perrara and Parasacharibacter apium. Collectively, our findings suggest that the early establishment of S. alvi is associated with healthy nurse development and potentially excludes F. perrara and P. apium from the ileum. Although at low abundance, establishment of the common midgut pathogen Nosema spp. was significantly associated with ileum dysbiosis and associated host deficiencies. Moreover, dysbiosis in the ileum was reflected in the rectum, mouthparts and hypopharyngeal glands, suggesting a systemic host effect. Our findings demonstrate that typically occurring alterations in diet quality play a significant role in colony health and the establishment of a dysbiotic gut microbiome. © Published 2016.

Large-scale monitoring of effects of clothianidin-dressed oilseed rape seeds on pollinating insects in Northern Germany: effects on honey bees (Apis mellifera)	Possible effects of clothianidin seed-treated oilseed rape on honey bee colonies were investigated in a large-scale monitoring project in Northern Germany, where oilseed rape usually comprises 25–33 % of the arable land. For both reference and test sites, six study locations were selected and eight honey bee hives were placed at each location. At each site, three locations were directly adjacent to oilseed rape fields and three locations were situated 400 m away from the nearest oilseed rape field. Thus, 96 hives were exposed to fully flowering oilseed rape crops. Colony sizes and weights, the amount of honey harvested, and infection with parasites and diseases were monitored between April and September 2014. The percentage of oilseed rape pollen was determined in pollen and honey samples. After oilseed rape flowering, the hives were transferred to an extensive isolated area for post-exposure monitoring. Total numbers of adult bees and brood cells showed seasonal fluctuations, and there were no significant differences between the sites. The honey, which was extracted at the end of the exposure phase, contained 62.0–83.5 % oilseed rape pollen. Varroa destructor infestation was low during most of the course of the study but increased at the end of the study due to flumethrin resistance in the mite populations. In summary, honey bee colonies foraging in clothianidin seed-treated oilseed rape did not show any detrimental symptoms as compared to colonies foraging in clothianidin-free oilseed rape. Development of colony strength, brood success as well as honey yield and pathogen infection were not significantly affected by clothianidin seed-treatment during this study. ï¿½ 2016, The Author(s).		clothianidin, flumethrin, ((E)-1-(2-chloro-1,3-thiazol-5-ylmethyl)-3-methyl-2-nitroguanidine), guanidine derivative, thiazole derivative, colony, honeybee, monitoring, neonicotinoid pesticide, pollinator, seed treatment, Article, biological monitoring, controlled study, flowering, foraging, Germany, honeybee, imago, insecticide resistance, mite, nonhuman, oilseed rape seed, organism colony, parasitosis, plant seed, pollen, pollination, population growth, priority journal, symptom, varroosis, animal, bee, chemistry, crop, drug effects, environmental monitoring, insect, physiology, plant seed, rapeseed, toxicity, Germany, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Brassica napus, Hexapoda, Varroa destructor, Animals, Bees, Brassica napus, Crops, Agricultural, Environmental Monitoring, Germany, Guanidines, Insects, Pollination, Seeds, Thiazoles	2016-11-01
Interactive effects of pesticide exposure and pathogen infection on bee health – a critical analysis	Bees are fundamentally important for pollination services and declines in populations could have significant economic and environmental implications. Pesticide exposure and pathogen infection are recognised as potential stressors impacting upon bee populations and recently there has been a surge in research on pesticide–disease interactions to reflect environmentally realistic scenarios better. We critically analyse the findings on pesticide–disease interactions, including effects on the survival, pathogen loads and immunity of bees, and assess the suitability of various endpoints to inform our mechanistic understanding of these interactions. We show that pesticide exposure and pathogen infection have not yet been found to interact to affect worker survival under field-realistic scenarios. Colony-level implications of pesticide effects on Nosema infections, viral loads and honey bee immunity remain unclear as these effects have been observed in a laboratory setting only using a small range of pesticide exposures, generally exceeding those likely to occur in the natural environment, and assessing a highly selected series of immune-related endpoints. Future research priorities include the need for a better understanding of pesticide effects on the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) component of an individual's immune response and on social defence behaviours. Interactions between pesticide exposure and bacterial and fungal infections have yet to be addressed. The paucity of studies in non-Apis bee species is a further major knowledge gap. © 2015 Cambridge Philosophical Society		pesticide, animal, bee, drug effects, microbiology, Nosema, physiology, pollination, social behavior, Animals, Bees, Nosema, Pesticides, Pollination, Social Behavior	2016-11-01
Genotype diversity in the honey bee parasite Nosema ceranae: multi-strain isolates, cryptic sex or both?	Background: There is great controversy as to whether Microsporidia undergo a sexual cycle. In the paradigmatic case of Nosema ceranae, although there is no morphological evidence of sex, some meiosis-specific genes are present in its reduced genome and there is also high intraspecific variability, with incongruent phylogenies having been systematically obtained. The possibility of sexual recombination is important from an epidemiological standpoint, particularly as N. ceranae is considered to be a major factor in the current disquieting epidemic of widespread bee colony losses. This parasite apparently originated in oriental honey bees, spreading out of Asia and Australia to infect honey bees worldwide. This study had three main objectives: i) to obtain genetic markers that are not part of known multi-copy arrays for strain determination; ii) to shed light on the intraspecific variability and recombination of N. ceranae; and iii) to assess the variability in N. ceranae populations. The answers to these questions are critical to understand the capacity of adaptation of microsporidia. Results: Biallelic polymorphisms were detected at a number of specific points in the five coding loci analyzed from European and Australian isolates of N. ceranae. Heterozygous genotypes were abundant and cloning experiments demonstrate that they reflect the existence of multiple alternative sequences in each isolate. The comparisons of different clones and genotypes clearly indicate that new haplotypes are generated by homologous recombination. Conclusions: The N. ceranae isolates from honey bees correspond to genotypically distinct populations, revealing that individual honey bees may not be infected by a particular clone but rather, a pool of different strains. Homologous recombination implies the existence of a cryptic sex cycle yet to be described in N. ceranae. There are no diagnostic alleles associated with Australian or European origins, nor are there differences between the two hosts, A. cerana and A. mellifera, supporting the absence of biological barriers for N. ceranae transmission. Diversity is high among microsporidia of both these origins, and the maintenance of a high heterozygosis in the recently invaded European populations, could hypothetically underlie the stronger virulence of N. ceranae observed in A. mellifera. © 2016 The Author(s).		adaptation, crypsis, genetic marker, genotype, heterozygosity, honeybee, parasite transmission, phylogeny, recombination, sexual reproduction, virulence, Asia, Australia, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Microsporidia, Nosema ceranae, genetic marker, animal, Australia, bee, fungal genome, genetic marker, genetic variation, genetics, haplotype, homologous recombination, isolation and purification, meiosis, Nosema, parasitology, phylogeny, physiology, single nucleotide polymorphism, virulence, Animals, Australia, Bees, Genetic Markers, Genetic Variation, Genome, Fungal, Haplotypes, Homologous Recombination, Meiosis, Nosema, Phylogeny, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Virulence	2016-10-18
Fast determination of neonicotinoid insecticides in bee pollen using QuEChERS and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry	In this study, a new method has been developed to determine seven neonicotinoid insecticides (acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam) in bee pollen using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a selective MS detector (qTOF). An efficient sample treatment involving an optimized quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe method was proposed. In all cases, average analyte recoveries were between 91 and 105%, and no matrix effect was observed. Chromatographic analysis (6.5 min) was performed on a core-shell technology based column (Kinetex® EVO C18, 50×2.1 mm, 1.7 μm, 100 Å). The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% of formic acid in ACN, with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min in gradient elution mode. The fully validated method was selective, linear from LOQ to 500 μg/kg, precise and accurate; relative standard deviation and relative error values were below 8%. Low limits LODs and LOQs were obtained, ranging from 0.6 to 1.3 μg/kg (LODs) and 2.1 to 4.0 μg/kg (LOQs). The method was applied to neonicotinoid analysis in several commercial bee pollen samples from different Spanish regions. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Importance of ecological factors and colony handling for optimizing health status of apiaries in mediterranean ecosystems	We analyzed six apiaries in several natural environments with a Mediterranean ecosystem in Madrid, central Spain, in order to understand how landscape and management characteristics may influence apiary health and bee production in the long term. We focused on five criteria (habitat quality, landscape heterogeneity, climate, management and health), as well as 30 subcriteria, and we used the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to rank them according to relevance. Habitat quality proved to have the highest relevance, followed by beehive management. Within habitat quality, the following subcriteria proved to be most relevant: orographic diversity, elevation range and important plant species located 1.5 km from the apiary. The most important subcriteria under beehive management were honey production, movement of the apiary to a location with a higher altitude and wax renewal. Temperature was the most important subcriterion under climate, while pathogen and Varroa loads were the most significant under health. Two of the six apiaries showed the best values in the AHP analysis and showed annual honey production of 70 and 28 kg/colony. This high productivity was due primarily to high elevation range and high orographic diversity, which favored high habitat quality. In addition, one of these apiaries showed the best value for beehive management, while the other showed the best value for health, reflected in the low pathogen load and low average number of viruses. These results highlight the importance of environmental factors and good sanitary practices to maximize apiary health and honey productivity. © 2016 Asensio et al.

Laboratory cage studies on the efficacy of some medicinal plant essential oils for controlling varroosis in Apis mellifera (Hym.: Apidae)	Varroosis is a disease of Apis mellifera L. caused by the mite Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman. Essential oils and their chemical constituents offer a safe alternative to synthetic acaricides for the control of this mite in bee hives. The present study was conducted to evaluate anti-parasitic activity of essential oils from Thymus kotschyanus Bioss & Hohen., Mentha longifolia L., Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh., and Ferula gummosa L. at concentrations of 1, 2.5, 4, and 5.5 μl/l air for 5 and 10 h. Findings indicated that mite mortality increased as oils concentration and exposure time increased. T. kotschyanus oil at 5.5 μl/l air caused a mite mortality rate of 54.4% and 84.43% after 5 and 10 h fumigation, respectively. At the same concentration and exposure time, the honey bee mortality was 0% and 7.2%, respectively. Application of M. longifolia and E. camaldulensis oils at 5.5 μl/l air resulted in 65.53% and 71.06% mortality in Varroa mites and 10.13% and 12% mortality in honey bees after 10 h exposure. Despite moderate acaricidal activity of F. gummosa oil against Varroa mite (49.69%), it was highly toxic to honey bee (30%). Also, GC/MS analysis of the oils showed that carvacrol (47.99%) and thymol (30.61%) in T. kotschyanus oil, piperitenone (36.86%), piperitenone oxide (27.53%),Cispiperitone epoxide (22.21%), and pulegone (8.38%) in M. longifoliaoil, 1,8-cineol (74.7%) and α-pinene (8.35%) in E. camaldulensis oil, and β-pinene (87.29%) in F. gummosa oil were the main chemical constituents. Collectively, our results led to a conclusion that T. kotschyanus, M. longifolia, and E. camaldulensis oils have enough potential to play an important role in integrated control programs of varroosis in apiaries. © 2017 Systematic & Applied Acarology Society.			2016-10-01
Effects of a neonicotinoid pesticide on thermoregulation of African honey bees (Apis mellifera scutellata)	Thiamethoxam is a widely used neonicotinoid pesticide that, as agonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, has been shown to elicit a variety of sublethal effects in honey bees. However, information concerning neonicotinoid effects on honey bee thermoregulation is lacking. Thermoregulation is an essential ability for the honey bee that guarantees the success of foraging and many in-hive tasks, especially brood rearing. We tested the effects of acute exposure to thiamethoxam (0.2, 1, 2 ng/bee) on the thorax temperatures of foragers exposed to low (22 °C) and high (33 °C) temperature environments. Thiamethoxam significantly altered honey bee thorax temperature at all doses tested; the effects elicited varied depending on the environmental temperature and pesticide dose to which individuals were exposed. When bees were exposed to the high temperature environment, the high dose of thiamethoxam increased their thorax temperature 1–2 h after exposure. When bees were exposed to the low temperature, the higher doses of the neonicotinoid reduced bee thorax temperatures 60–90 min after treatment. In both experiments, the neonicotinoid decreased the temperature of bees the day following the exposure. After a cold shock (5 min at 4 °C), the two higher doses elicited a decrease of the thorax temperature, while the lower dose caused an increase, compared to the control. These alterations in thermoregulation caused by thiamethoxam may affect bee foraging activity and a variety of in-hive tasks, likely leading to negative consequences at the colony level. Our results shed light on sublethal effect of pesticides which our bees have to deal with. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd		colony structure, foraging behavior, high temperature, honeybee, sublethal effect, thermoregulation, thiamethoxam, Apis mellifera, Apis mellifera scutellata, Apoidea, insecticide, nitro derivative, oxazine derivative, thiamethoxam, thiazole derivative, animal, bee, cold shock response, drug effects, physiology, thermoregulation, Animals, Bees, Body Temperature Regulation, Cold-Shock Response, Insecticides, Nitro Compounds, Oxazines, Thiazoles	2016-10-01
Improving reliability and reducing overhead in low-power sensor networks using trust and forgiveness	Wireless sensor networks operate in open environments with potentially rough conditions. The utilised protocols to implement routing decisions in such networks are typically designed to work under challenging external influences. In this paper, we focus on the most popular representative, the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), and propose a set of techniques to improve the routing schemes. We transfer the concepts of computational trust and forgiveness as known from the Organic Computing domain and equip participating nodes with dynamic decision schemes to choose interaction partners in RPL. We evaluate the different concepts in simulations with changing topological structure and different attacks. Based on this setting, we identify which concept promises the highest benefit and outline how this can be utilised in RPL. © 2016 IEEE.

In-hive Pesticide Exposome: Assessing risks to migratory honey bees from in-hive pesticide contamination in the Eastern United States	This study measured part of the in-hive pesticide exposome by analyzing residues from live in-hive bees, stored pollen, and wax in migratory colonies over time and compared exposure to colony health. We summarized the pesticide burden using three different additive methods: (1) the hazard quotient (HQ), an estimate of pesticide exposure risk, (2) the total number of pesticide residues, and (3) the number of relevant residues. Despite being simplistic, these models attempt to summarize potential risk from multiple contaminations in real-world contexts. Colonies performing pollination services were subject to increased pesticide exposure compared to honey-production and holding yards. We found clear links between an increase in the total number of products in wax and colony mortality. In particular, we found that fungicides with particular modes of action increased disproportionally in wax within colonies that died. The occurrence of queen events, a significant risk factor for colony health and productivity, was positively associated with all three proxies of pesticide exposure. While our exposome summation models do not fully capture the complexities of pesticide exposure, they nonetheless help elucidate their risks to colony health. Implementing and improving such models can help identify potential pesticide risks, permitting preventative actions to improve pollinator health. ï¿½ The Author(s) 2016.			2016-09-15
Land-use change reduces habitat suitability for supporting managed honey bee colonies in the Northern Great Plains	Human reliance on insect pollination services continues to increase even as pollinator populations exhibit global declines. Increased commodity crop prices and federal subsidies for biofuel crops, such as corn and soybeans, have contributed to rapid land-use change in the US Northern Great Plains (NGP), changes that may jeopardize habitat for honey bees in a part of the country that supports >40% of the US colony stock. We investigated changes in biofuel crop production and grassland land covers surrounding ?18,000 registered commercial apiaries in North and South Dakota from 2006 to 2014. We then developed habitat selection models to identify remotely sensed land-cover and land-use features that influence apiary site selection by Dakota beekeepers. Our study demonstrates a continual increase in biofuel crops, totaling 1.2 Mha, around registered apiary locations in North and South Dakota. Such crops were avoided by commercial beekeepers when selecting apiary sites in this region. Furthermore, our analysis reveals how grasslands that beekeepers target when selecting commercial apiary locations are becoming less common in eastern North and South Dakota, changes that may have lasting impact on pollinator conservation efforts. Our study highlights how land-use change in the NGP is altering the landscape in ways that are seemingly less conducive to beekeeping. Our models can be used to guide future conservation efforts highlighted in the US national pollinator health strategy by identifying areas that support high densities of commercial apiaries and that have exhibited significant land-use changes.		apiculture, Conference Paper, controlled study, energy crop, grassland, habitat, habitat selection, honeybee, land use, landscape, nonhuman, predictor variable, priority journal, South Dakota, agriculture, animal, bee, ecosystem, environmental protection, growth, development and aging, human, maize, physiology, pollination, soybean, Agriculture, Animals, Bees, Conservation of Natural Resources, Ecosystem, Humans, Pollination, South Dakota, Soybeans, Zea mays	2016-09-13
Infestation of Apis mellifera colonies by Megaselia scalaris (Loew, 1866) in Abruzzo and Molise regions, central-southern Italy	Phoridae, which belong to the Diptera order, were identified as the cause of serious infestations of Apis mellifera colonies in the American continent such as Phoridae from the genus “Melaloncha” in Central America and Apocephalus borealis in the USA. Some authors identified a novel phorid, Megaselia scalaris, as a possible parasitoid of honey bee in Brazil. Recently, in Europe, Diptera from the genus Megaselia was found able to parasitize adults of A. mellifera. So far, in the old continent, such infestation was reported only in bees dead or affected by other diseases, but never in healthy bees. From July through August 2014, the prevalence of myiases affecting A. mellifera was verified in Abruzzo and Molise regions. Most of the selected apiaries showed a great infestation of bees due to M. scalaris, even if they were apparently healthy, during trapping back from their foraging trip. Here, we report the results of our work to stress the impact that this parasitoid might have on health condition of beehive. Â© 2016 The Author(s).

A pest and disease survey of the isolated Norfolk Island honey bee (Apis mellifera) population	Norfolk Island is one of Australia’s most remote communities, located about 1,400 km east of the mainland. This report is the first documented survey of pests and diseases affecting the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) population on Norfolk Island. The only invertebrate pest detected during the survey was the lesser wax moth (Achroia grisella), and only one honey bee virus was identified (Lake Sinai virus 1). The microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae was also detected in the majority of adult bee samples, but Nosema apis was not present in any of the samples analyzed. Given that honey bee imports to Norfolk Island ceased in 1992, we discuss possible scenarios for N. ceranae introduction to the island. Lineage analysis also determined that Norfolk Island’s honey bees are for the most part from Eastern Europe (probably A. m. ligustica and A. m. carnica) with a small percentage from Western Europe (probably A. m. mellifera). This survey has identified a remote and isolated honey bee population that is relatively free from major pests and diseases that affect honey bees around the world. This knowledge will help inform trade policy and management strategies for maintaining the unique health status of honey bees on Norfolk Island. © 2016 International Bee Research Association.			2016-09-12
Variations in the availability of pollen resources affect honey bee health	Intensive agricultural systems often expose honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) to large temporal variations in the availability (quantity, quality and diversity) of nutritional resources. Such nutritional irregularity is expected to affect honey bee health. We therefore tested under laboratory conditions the effect of such variation in pollen availability on honey bee health (survival and nursing physiology-hypopharyngeal gland development and vitellogenin expression). We fed honey bees with different diets composed of pollen pellets collected by honey bees in an agricultural landscape of western France. Slight drops (5-10%) in the availability of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) pollen resulted in significant reductions of all tested variables. Despite some variations in taxonomic diversity and nutritional quality, the pollen mixes harvested over the season had a similar positive influence on honey bee health, except for the one collected in late July that induced poor survival and nursing physiology. This period coincided with the mass-flowering of maize (Zea mays L.), an anemophilous crop which produces poor-quality pollen. Therefore, changes in bee health were not connected to variations in pollen diversity but rather to variations in pollen depletion and quality, such as can be encountered in an intensive agricultural system of western France. Finally, even though pollen can be available ad libitum during the mass-flowering of some crops (e.g. maize), it can fail to provide bees with diet adequate for their development. © 2016 Di Pasquale et al.

Go east for better honey bee health: Apis cerana is faster at hygienic behavior than A. mellifera	The poor health status of the Western honey bee, Apis mellifera, compared to its Eastern counterpart, Apis cerana, is remarkable. This has been attributed to lower pathogen prevalence in A. cerana colonies and to their ability to survive infestations with the ectoparasitic mite, Varroa destructor. These properties have been linked to an enhanced removal of dead or unhealthy immature bees by adult workers in this species. Although such hygienic behavior is known to contribute to honey bee colony health, comparative data of A. mellifera and A. cerana in performing this task are scarce. Here, we compare for the first time the removal of freeze-killed brood in one population of each species and over two seasons in China. Our results show that A. cerana was significantly faster than A. mellifera at both opening cell caps and removing freeze-killed brood. The fast detection and removal of diseased brood is likely to limit the proliferation of pathogenic agents. Given our results can be generalized to the species level, a rapid hygienic response could contribute to the better health of A. cerana. Promoting the fast detection and removal of worker brood through adapted breeding programs could further improve the social immunity of A. mellifera colonies and contribute to a better health status of the Western honey bee worldwide. © 2016 Lin et al.

Application of wireless sensor networks for beehive monitoring and in-hive thermal patterns detection	As cold-blooded animals, bees seek to control the environment thermal variation to live and work in their hives. In semi-arid regions, such as in Northeast Brazil, bees lead a natural thermoregulation mechanism inside their hives so that they can deal with high temperatures. However, when thermoregulation is not fully accomplished, all bees can leave the nest in a process known as colony absconding. In such a process, absconding is due to a thermal stress stimulus. In this context, here we propose a proactive monitoring of hives using a wireless sensor network which detects atypical heating. Through thermal patterns obtained on a daily basis, we developed a mechanism for detecting the temperature rise inside the hive (microclimate). Our results show various thermal patterns related to hive conditions, and highlight the temperature as a key factor to detect potential absconding conditions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of dicyclohexylamine and fumagillin on Nosema ceranae-infected honey bee (Apis mellifera) mortality in cage trial assays	Both commercially available fumagillin-based treatments for honey bees (Apis mellifera), Fumagilin-B® as well as Fumidil-B®, contain the reportedly genotoxic and tumorigenic compound dicyclohexylamine (DCH) as the counter ion in the fumagillin-DCH salt. The effect of DCH, purified fumagillin (containing no DCH), and the commercial formulation Fumagilin-B® (containing both fumagillin as well as DCH) on the mortality of caged Nosema ceranae-infected honey bees was investigated. A statistically significant risk of bee mortality associated with oral exposure to DCH was observed. DCH is also known to be significantly more stable than fumagillin in honey under a variety of temperature conditions, both in the presence and absence of light. The presence of DCH in the hive is therefore a potential concern for bee health and also for food safety. © 2015, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		food safety, genotoxicity, honey, honeybee, mortality, organic compound, pollution effect, pollution exposure, salt, statistical analysis, temperature gradient, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Nosema ceranae	2016-09-01
Influence of pollen deprivation on the fore wing asymmetry of honeybee workers and drones	Environmental stress during development can be linked to changes in morphological traits of the organism such as increased fluctuating asymmetry. In suboptimal conditions, like food deprivation, developmental stability may be perturbed, because organisms are not able to buffer disturbances caused by stressors and, in effect, greater degrees of asymmetry can arise during development. In this study, honeybee workers and drones were reared in colonies with limited and unlimited access to pollen. The developmental instability of the workers and drones in these colonies was assessed using the asymmetry of their fore wing venation. Both workers and drones showed a similar directional asymmetry of size—in favour of the right wing—and significant, but dissimilar, differences of wing shape. Limited access to pollen caused some differences in the fluctuating asymmetry of size and shape in pollen-deprived workers and drones compared to the control bees. However, more pronounced differences were found due to replication than to pollen deprivation itself. © 2016, The Author(s).		adaptation, body shape, developmental stability, ecomorphology, environmental stress, fluctuating asymmetry, honeybee, instability, pollen, rearing, wing, Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2016-09-01
Key management practices to prevent high infestation levels of Varroa destructor in honey bee colonies at the beginning of the honey yield season	Varroa destructor is considered one of the main threats to worldwide apiculture causing a variety of physiological effects at individual and colony level. Also, Varroa mites are often associated with several honey bee viruses presence. Relatively low levels of Varroa during the spring, at the beginning of the honey yield season, can have a significant economic impact on honey production and colony health. Winter treatments against Varroa and certain management practices may delay mite population growth during following spring and summer improving colonies performance during the honey yield season. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with the presence of Varroa destructor in late spring in apiaries from temperate climate. A longitudinal study was carried out in 48 apiaries, randomly selected to evaluate V. destructor infestation level throughout the year. The percentage of infestation with V. destructor was assessed four times during one year and the beekeepers answered a survey concerning all management practices applied in the colonies. We used a generalized linear mixed model to determine association between risk of achieving 2% infestation on adult bees at the beginning of the honey yield season and all potential explanatory variables. The complete dataset was scanned to identify colonies clusters with a higher probability of achieving damage thresholds throughout the year. Colonies that achieved ≥2% of infestation with V. destructor during spring were owned by less experienced beekeepers. Moreover, as Varroa populations increase exponentially during spring and summer, if the spring sampling time is later this growth remains unobserved. Monitoring and winter treatment can be critical for controlling mite population during the honey production cycle. Spatial distribution of colonies with a higher risk of achieving high Varroa levels seems to be better explained by management practices than a geographical condition. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.		animal, apiculture, Argentina, bee, honey, longitudinal study, parasitology, procedures, risk factor, season, Varroidae, Animals, Argentina, Beekeeping, Bees, Honey, Longitudinal Studies, Risk Factors, Seasons, Varroidae	2016-09-01
Species-specific diagnostics of Apis mellifera trypanosomatids: A nine-year survey (2007–2015) for trypanosomatids and microsporidians in Serbian honey bees	In this study, honey bees collected in Serbia over 9 consecutive years (2007–2015) were retrospectively surveyed to determine the prevalence of eukaryotic gut parasites by molecular screening of archival DNA samples. We developed species-specific primers for PCR to detect the two known honey bee trypanosomatid species, Crithidia mellificae and the recently described Lotmaria passim. These primers were validated for target specificity under single and mixed-species conditions as well as against the bumblebee trypanosomatid Crithidia bombi. Infections by Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae (Microsporidia) were also determined using PCR. Samples from 162 colonies (18 from each year) originating from 57 different localities were surveyed. L. passim was detected in every year with an overall frequency of 62.3% and annual frequencies ranging from 38.9% to 83.3%. This provides the earliest confirmed record to date for L. passim and the first report of this species in Serbia. N. ceranae was ubiquitous, occurring in every year and at 95.7% overall frequency, ranging annually from 83.3% to 100%. The majority of colonies (60.5%) were co-infected with L. passim and N. ceranae, but colony infections by each species were statistically independent of one another over the nine years. Although C. mellificae and N. apis have both been reported recently at low frequency in Europe, neither of these species was detected in Serbia. These results support the hypothesis that L. passim has predominated over C. mellificae in A. mellifera during the past decade. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.		animal, bee, parasitology, polymerase chain reaction, Serbia, species difference, Trypanosomatidae, Animals, Bees, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Serbia, Species Specificity, Trypanosomatina	2016-09-01
Season and landscape composition affect pollen foraging distances and habitat use of Honey bees	Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) show a large variation in foraging distances and use a broad range of plant species as pollen resources, even in regions with intensive agriculture. However, it is unknown how increasing areas of mass-flowering crops like oilseed rape (Brassica napus; OSR) or a decrease of seminatural habitats (SNH) change the temporal and spatial availability of pollen resources for honey bee colonies, and thus foraging distances and firequency in different habitat types. We studied pollen foraging of honey bee colonies in 16 agricultural landscapes with independent gradients of OSR and SNH area within 2 km and used waggle dances and digital geographic maps with major land cover types to reveal the distance and visited habitat type on a landscape level. Mean pollen foraging distance of 1347 decoded bee dances was 1015 m (± 26 m; SEM). In spring, increasing area of flowering OSR within 2 km reduced mean pollen foraging distances from 1324 m to only 435 m. In summer, increasing cover of SNH areas close to the colonies (within 200 m radius) reduced mean pollen foraging distances from 846 to 469 m. Frequency of pollen foragers per habitat type, measured as the number of dances per hour and hectare, was equally high for SNH, grassland, and OSR fields, but lower for other crops and forests. In landscapes with a small proportion of SNH a significantly higher density of pollen foragers on SNH was observed, indicating that pollen resources in such simple agricultural landscapes are more limited. Overall, we conclude that SNH and mass-fowering crops can reduce foraging distances of honey bee colonies at different scales and seasons with possible benefits for the performance of honey bee colonies. Further, mixed agricultural landscapes with a high proportion of SNH reduce foraging densities of honey bees in SNH and thus possible competition for pollen resources. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.		agricultural land, competition (ecology), habitat type, habitat use, honeybee, intensive agriculture, land cover, pollen, seasonal variation, vegetable oil, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Brassica napus, animal, animal dispersal, bee, crop, ecosystem, flying, physiology, pollen, season, Animal Distribution, Animals, Bees, Crops, Agricultural, Ecosystem, Flight, Animal, Pollen, Seasons	2016-09-01
Stock composition of northern neotropical honey bees: mitotype and morphotype diversity in Mexico (Hymenoptera: Apidae)	The stock of honey bees in the northern neotropics is likely a composite of European and African lineages, but the genetic makeup of most populations in this region has remained unstudied. We analyzed the genetic composition of honey bees across temperate and tropical regions of Mexico using mitochondrial and morphometric analyses. The results showed that honey bees from Mexico are descendent almost in similar proportion from matrilines of African and European origins. However, morphometrics indicate that most colonies are the result of extensive introgressive hybridization with Africanized bees. While large-scale displacement of European honey bees seems to have occurred in the tropical regions, higher frequencies of colonies with a mixed range of African-European markers were identified in the temperate areas. Our results suggest that the outcome of the hybridization between Africanized and European honey bees in Mexico has been significantly associated with climate. © 2015, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		character displacement, DNA, honeybee, hybridization, mitochondrion, morphotype, Neotropical Region, population genetics, Africa, Europe, Mexico [Mexico (NTN)], Mexico [North America], Apidae, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hymenoptera	2016-09-01
The canary in the coalmine; bee declines as an indicator of environmental health	Bee declines have received much attention of late, but there is considerable debate and confusion as to the extent, significance and causes of declines. In part, this reflects conflation of data for domestic honeybees, numbers of which are largely driven by economic factors, with those for wild bees, many of which have undergone marked range contractions but for the majority of which we have no good data on population size. There is no doubt that bees are subject to numerous pressures in the modern world. The abundance and diversity of flowers has declined along with availability of suitable nest sites, bees are chronically exposed to cocktails of agrochemicals, and they are simultaneously exposed to novel parasites and pathogens accidentally spread by humans. Climate change is likely to exacerbate these problems in the future, particularly for coolclimate specialists such as bumblebees. Stressors do not act in isolation; for example pesticide exposure can impair both detoxification mechanisms and immune responses, rendering bees more susceptible to parasites. It seems certain that chronic exposure to multiple, interacting stressors is driving honeybee colony losses and declines of wild pollinators. Bees have a high profile and so their travails attract attention, but these same stressors undoubtedly bear upon other wild organisms, many of which are not monitored and have few champions. Those wild insects for which we do have population data (notably butterflies and moths) are overwhelmingly also in decline. We argue that bee declines are indicators of pervasive and ongoing environmental damage that is likely to impact broadly on biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides. ï¿½ 2016, Science Reviews 2000 Ltd.

Toxicity, monitoring and biodegradation of the fungicide carbendazim	The increasing use of toxic pesticides is a major environmental concern. Carbendazim is a systemic fungicide having wide applications for controlling fungal diseases in agriculture, forestry and veterinary medicines. Carbendazim is a major pollutant detectable in food, soil and water. Carbendazim extensive and repeated use induces acute and delayed toxic effects on humans, invertebrates, aquatic life forms and soil microorganisms. Here, we review the pollution, non-target toxicity and microbial degradation of carbendazim for crop and veterinary purposes. We found that carbendazim causes embryotoxicity, apoptosis, teratogenicity, infertility, hepatocellular dysfunction, endocrine-disrupting effects, disruption of haematological functions, mitotic spindle abnormalities, mutagenic and aneugenic effect. We also found that carbendazim disrupted the microbial community structure in various ecosystems. The detection of carbendazim in soil and reservoir sites is performed by spectroscopic, chromatographic, voltammetric, nanoparticles, carbon electrodes and mass spectrometry. A review of the degradation of carbendazim shows that carbendazim undergoes partial to complete biodegradation in the soil and water by Azospirillum, Aeromonas, Alternaria, Bacillus, Brevibacillus, Nocardioides, Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, Rhodococcus, Sphingomonas, Streptomyces and Trichoderma. ï¿½ 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.			2016-09-01
Migratory management and environmental conditions affect lifespan and oxidative stress in honey bees	Most pollination in large-scale agriculture is dependent on managed colonies of a single species, the honey bee Apis mellifera. More than 1 million hives are transported to California each year just to pollinate the almonds, and bees are trucked across the country for various cropping systems. Concerns have been raised about whether such "migratory management" causes bees undue stress; however to date there have been no longer-term studies rigorously addressing whether migratory management is detrimental to bee health. To address this issue, we conducted field experiments comparing bees from commercial and experimental migratory beekeeping operations to those from stationary colonies to quantify effects on lifespan, colony health and productivity, and levels of oxidative damage for individual bees. We detected a significant decrease in lifespan of migratory adult bees relative to stationary bees. We also found that migration affected oxidative stress levels in honey bees, but that food scarcity had an even larger impact; some detrimental effects of migration may be alleviated by a greater abundance of forage. In addition, rearing conditions affect levels of oxidative damage incurred as adults. This is the first comprehensive study on impacts of migratory management on the health and oxidative stress of honey bees.		adult, apiculture, field experiment, forage, honeybee, lifespan, oxidative stress, productivity, quantitative study, rearing	2016-08-24
Drone exposure to the systemic insecticide Fipronil indirectly impairs queen reproductive potential	A species that requires sexual reproduction but cannot reproduce is doomed to extinction. The important increasing loss of species emphasizes the ecological significance of elucidating the effects of environmental stressors, such as pesticides, on reproduction. Despite its special reproductive behavior, the honey bee was selected as a relevant and integrative environmental model because of its constant and diverse exposure to many stressors due to foraging activity. The widely used insecticide Fipronil, the use of which is controversial because of its adverse effects on honey bees, was chosen to expose captive drones in hives via syrup contaminated at 0.1 μg/L and gathered by foragers. Such environmental exposure led to decreased spermatozoa concentration and sperm viability coupled with an increased sperm metabolic rate, resulting in drone fertility impairment. Subsequently, unexposed queens inseminated with such sperm exhibited fewer spermatozoa with lower viability in their spermatheca, leaving no doubt about the detrimental consequences for the reproductive potential of queens, which are key for colony sustainability. These findings suggest that pesticides could contribute to declining honey bee populations through fertility impairment, as exemplified by Fipronil. More broadly, reproductive disorders should be taken into consideration when investigating the decline of other species. © The Author(s) 2016.			2016-08-23
Queens become workers: Pesticides alter caste differentiation in bees	Bees are important for the world biodiversity and economy because they provide key pollination services in forests and crops. However, pesticide use in crops has adversely affected (decreased) queen production because of increased mortality among larvae. Here, we demonstrated that in vitro-reared queens of a neotropical social bee species (Plebeia droryana) also showed high larval mortality after exposure to an organophosphate pesticide (chlorpyrifos) via larval food. Moreover, most of the surviving larvae that were destined to develop into queens became workers more likely because they ate less food than expected without pesticide skewing thus caste differentiation in this bee species. This adverse effect has not been previously reported for any other social insects, such as honeybees or bumblebees. Queens are essential for breeding and colony growth. Therefore, if our data are applicable to other pantropical social bee species across the globe, it is likely that these bees are at a serious risk of failure to form new colonies. ï¿½ The Author(s) 2016.			2016-08-17
Honey bee gut microbiome is altered by in-hive pesticide exposures	Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are the primary pollinators of major horticultural crops. Over the last few decades, a substantial decline in honey bees and their colonies have been reported. While a plethora of factors could contribute to the putative decline, pathogens, and pesticides are common concerns that draw attention. In addition to potential direct effects on honey bees, indirect pesticide effects could include alteration of essential gut microbial communities and symbionts that are important to honey bee health (e.g., immune system). The primary objective of this study was to determine the microbiome associated with honey bees exposed to commonly used in-hive pesticides: coumaphos, tau-fluvalinate, and chlorothalonil. Treatments were replicated at three independent locations near Blacksburg Virginia, and included a no-pesticide amended control at each location. The microbiome was characterized through pyrosequencing of V2-V3 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS region. Pesticide exposure significantly affected the structure of bacterial but not fungal communities. The bee bacteriome, similar to other studies, was dominated by sequences derived from Bacilli, Actinobacteria, α-, β-, γ-proteobacteria. The fungal community sequences were dominated by Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes. The Multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP) and subsequent Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis indicated that chlorothalonil caused significant change to the structure and functional potential of the honey bee gut bacterial community relative to control. Putative genes for oxidative phosphorylation, for example, increased while sugar metabolism and peptidase potential declined in the microbiome of chlorothalonil exposed bees. The results of this field-based study suggest the potential for pesticide induced changes to the honey bee gut microbiome that warrant further investigation. ï¿½ 2016 Kakumanu, Reeves, Anderson, Rodrigues and Williams.		chlorothalonil, coumafos, fluvalinate, pesticide, RNA 16S, Actinobacteria, Article, Bacilli, controlled study, Firmicutes, honeybee, intestine flora, microbial diversity, nonhuman, oxidative phosphorylation, phylogeny, Proteobacteria, pyrosequencing, Rhodocyclales, sequence analysis	2016-08-16
Land use in the Northern Great Plains region of the U.S. influences the survival and productivity of honey bee colonies	The Northern Great Plains region of the US annually hosts a large portion of commercially managed U.S. honey bee colonies each summer. Changing land use patterns over the last several decades have contributed to declines in the availability of bee forage across the region, and the future sustainability of the region to support honey bee colonies is unclear. We examined the influence of varying land use on the survivorship and productivity of honey bee colonies located in six apiaries within the Northern Great Plains state of North Dakota, an area of intensive agriculture and high density of beekeeping operations. Land use surrounding the apiaries was quantified over three years, 2010-2012, and survival and productivity of honey bee colonies were determined in response to the amount of bee forage land within a 3.2-km radius of each apiary. The area of uncultivated forage land (including pasture, USDA conservation program fields, fallow land, flowering woody plants, grassland, hay land, and roadside ditches) exerted a positive impact on annual apiary survival and honey production. Taxonomic diversity of bee-collected pollen and pesticide residues contained therein varied seasonally among apiaries, but overall were not correlated to large-scale land use patterns or survival and honey production. The predominant flowering plants utilized by honey bee colonies for pollen were volunteer species present in unmanaged (for honey bees), and often ephemeral, lands; thus placing honey bee colonies in a precarious situation for acquiring forage and nutrients over the entire growing season. We discuss the implications for land management, conservation, and beekeeper site selection in the Northern Great Plains to adequately support honey bee colonies and insure long term security for pollinator-dependent crops across the entire country. ï¿½ 2016 Elsevier B.V.		agricultural management, apiculture, biological production, colony, forage, honey, honeybee, intensive agriculture, land use change, pesticide residue, pollen, site selection, survivorship, sustainability, taxonomy, Great Plains, North Dakota, United States, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Magnoliophyta	2016-08-16
Early gut colonizers shape parasite susceptibility and microbiota composition in honey bee workers	Microbial symbionts living within animal guts are largely composed of resident bacterial species, forming communities that often provide benefits to the host. Gut microbiomes of adult honey bees (Apis mellifera) include core residents such as the betaproteobacterium Snodgrassella alvi, alongside transient parasites such as the protozoan Lotmaria passim. To test how these species affect microbiome composition and host physiology, we administered S. alvi and/or L. passim inocula to newly emergedworker bees from four genetic backgrounds (GH) and reared them in normal (within hives) or stressed (proteindeficient, asocial) conditions.Microbiota acquired by normal bees were abundant but quantitatively differed across treatments, indicating treatment-associated dysbiosis. Pretreatment with S. alvi made normal bees more susceptible to L. passim and altered developmental and detoxification gene expression. Stressed bees were more susceptible to L. passim and were depauperate in core microbiota, yet supplementation with S. alvi did not alter this susceptibility. Microbiomes were generally more variable by GH in stressed bees, which also showed opposing and comparatively reduced modulation of gene expression responses to treatments compared with normal bees. These data provide experimental support for a link between altered gut microbiota and increased parasite and pathogen prevalence, as observed from honey bee colony collapse disorder.		adult, animal experiment, Article, bacterial colonization, Betaproteobacteria, colony collapse, controlled study, detoxification, dysbiosis, gene expression, honeybee, host pathogen interaction, intestine, intestine flora, Lotmania passim, microbial community, microbiome, nonhuman, parasite, priority journal, protozoon, Snodgrassella alvi, animal, bee, disease predisposition, gastrointestinal tract, genetics, microbiology, parasitology, cytochrome P450, Animals, Bees, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, Disease Susceptibility, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Gastrointestinal Tract	2016-08-16
Bay laurel (Laurus nobilis) as potential antiviral treatment in naturally BQCV infected honeybees	Viral diseases are one of the multiple factors associated with honeybee colony losses. Apart from their innate immune system, including the RNAi machinery, honeybees can use secondary plant metabolites to reduce or fully cure pathogen infections. Here, we tested the antiviral potential of Laurus nobilis leaf ethanolic extracts on forager honeybees naturally infected with BQCV (Black queen cell virus). Total viral loads were reduced even at the lowest concentration tested (1 mg/ml). Higher extract concentrations (≥5 mg/ml) significantly reduced virus replication. Measuring vitellogenin gene expression as an indicator for transcript homeostasis revealed constant RNA levels before and after treatment, suggesting that its expression was not impacted by the L. nobilis treatment. In conclusion, plant secondary metabolites can reduce virus loads and virus replication in naturally infected honeybees. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Proteome analysis of the hemolymph, mushroom body, and antenna provides novel insight into honeybee resistance against varroa infestation	Varroa destructor has been identified as a major culprit responsible for the losses of millions of honeybee colonies. Varroa sensitive hygiene (VSH) is a suite of behaviors from adult bees to suppress mite reproduction by uncapping and/or removing mite infested pupae from a sealed brood. Despite the efforts to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of VSH, they remain largely unknown. We investigated the proteome of mushroom bodies (MBs) and antennae of adult bees with and without VSH from a stock selected for VSH based on their response to artificially Varroa-infected brood cells by near-infrared camera observation. The pupal hemolymph proteome was also compared between the VSH-line and the line that was not selected for VSH. The identified 8609 proteins in the hemolymph, MBs, and antennae represent the most depth coverage of the honeybee proteome (>55%) to date. In the hemolymph, the VSH-line adapts a unique strategy to boost the social immunity and drive pupal organogenesis by enhancing energy metabolism and protein biosynthesis. In MBs, the up-regulated proteins implicated in neuronal sensitivity suggest their roles to promote the execution of VSH by activation of synaptic vesicles and calcium channel activities. In antennae, the highly expressed proteins associated with sensitivity of olfactory senses and signal transmissions signify their roles by inputting a strong signal to the MBs for initiating VSH. These observations illustrate that the enhanced social immunities and olfactory and neuronal sensitivity play key roles in the combat against Varroa infestation. The identified candidate markers may be useful for accelerating marker-associated selection for VSH to aid in resistance to a parasite responsible for decline in honeybee health. © 2016 American Chemical Society.		calcium channel, proteome, proteome, adult, antenna (organ), Article, controlled study, energy metabolism, hemolymph, honeybee, infection resistance, mushroom body, nonhuman, organogenesis, priority journal, protein analysis, protein expression, protein synthesis, signal transduction, synapse vesicle, upregulation, Varroa destructor, varroosis, animal, bee, chemistry, cytology, host parasite interaction, immunology, mite infestation, olfactory receptor neuron, parasitology, pathogenicity, proteomics, pupa, Varroidae, Animals, Arthropod Antennae, Bees, Energy Metabolism, Hemolymph, Host-Parasite Interactions, Mite Infestations, Mushroom Bodies, Olfactory Receptor Neurons, Protein Biosynthesis, Proteome, Proteomics, Pupa, Signal Transduction, Up-Regulation, Varroidae	2016-08-05
Detection and quantification of boscalid and its metabolites in honeybees	Boscalid is a new-generation fungicide that has been detected in several bee matrices. The objective of this work was to characterize boscalid metabolites in honeybees based on in vivo experimentation, and next to verify the presence of theses metabolites into honeybees from colonies presenting troubles. A methodology based on complementary mass spectrometric tools, namely ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QToF) or triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ) was implemented. Honeybees were sprayed with boscalid, at field rate (to induce the metabolization process) and the parent compound with its generated metabolites were then extracted using modified EU-QuEChERS method. The mass characteristics including exact mass, isotopic profile and mass fragments allowed assuming the structure of several metabolites. Some of them were unambiguously identified by comparison with synthesized analytical standards. The metabolites were resulted from hydroxylation and dechlorination of the parent compound as well as the substitution of a chlorine atom with an hydroxyl group. The metabolites were then quantified in bee samples collected from various beehives located in France. Boscalid and three of its metabolites were present in some samples at a level ranged between 0.2 and 36.3 ng/g. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Spermatozoa capacitation in female Varroa destructor and its influence on the timing and success of female reproduction	Mating of Varroa destructor takes place inside the sealed honey bee brood cell. During copulation, male mites transfer the spermatozoa into the genital openings of the females. Before the fertilization of female germ cells, the transferred spermatozoa have to pass through a final maturation process inside the genital tract of the female, the so-called capacitation. We here describe for the first time the morphological changes and chronological sequence of spermatozoa capacitation within female V. destructor. We have defined seven distinct stages of spermatozoa during the process of capacitation and have shown that it takes about 5 days from mating to the occurrence of spermatozoa ready for fertilization. This might explain the results of an additional experiment where we could show that freshly mated daughter mites need a phoretic phase on bees before their first reproduction cycle. The transfer of non-capacitated spermatozoa from male V. destructor and the resulting long capacitation period within the female mites seems to be a consequence of an adaptive pressure for the male mites to inseminate several daughter mites within the short time span inside the sealed honey bee brood cell. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.		copulation, female, fertilization (reproduction), germ cell, honeybee, maturation, mite, morphology, reproduction, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Varroa destructor, animal, bee, female, male, parasitology, physiology, reproduction, spermatozoon capacitation, Varroidae, Animals, Bees, Female, Male, Reproduction, Sperm Capacitation, Varroidae	2016-08-01
Abiotic and biotic factors affecting the replication and pathogenicity of bee viruses	Bees are important pollinators of plants in both agricultural and non-agricultural landscapes. Recent losses of both managed and wild bee species have negative impacts on crop production and ecosystem diversity. Therefore, in order to mitigate bee losses, it is important to identify the factors most responsible. Multiple factors including pathogens, agrochemical exposure, lack of quality forage, and reduced habitat affect bee health. Pathogen prevalence is one factor that has been associated with colony losses. Numerous pathogens infect bees including fungi, protists, bacteria, and viruses, the majority of which are RNA viruses including several that infect multiple bee species. RNA viruses readily infect bees, yet there is limited understanding of their impacts on bee health, particularly in the context of other stressors. Herein we review the influence environmental factors have on the replication and pathogenicity of bee viruses and identify research areas that require further investigation. © 2016 The Authors.			2016-08-01
The Effects of Crop Intensification on the Diversity of Native Pollinator Communities	Increases in agricultural conversion are leading to declines in native grasslands and natural resources critical for beneficial insects. However, little is known regarding how these changes affect pollinator diversity. Land use types were categorized within 300 m and 3 km radii of pollinator sampling locations in Brookings County, SD. Pollinator abundance and species richness were regressed on the proportion of the landscape dedicated to row crops, grass and pasture, forage crops, small grains, and aquatic habitats using variance components modeling. Row crops had a negative effect on bee abundance at 300 m, after fixed effects modeling accounted for outliers skewing this relationship. At 3 km, corn positively affected bee abundance and richness, while soybean acreage decreased species richness. The landscape matrix of outlying sites consisted of large monocultured areas with few alternative habitat types available, leading to inflated populations of Melissodes and Halictidae. Syrphids had a positive parabolic relationship between diversity and row crops, indicating potential for competitive exclusion from intermediate landscapes. Unlike other studies, landscape diversity within 300 m was not found to significantly benefit pollinator diversity. Within especially agriculturally developed areas of the region, high abundances of pollinators suggest selection for a few dominant species. There was no effect of forage crops or aquatic habitats on pollinator diversity, indicating that less highly managed areas still represent degraded habitat within the landscape. Incorporating pollinator-friendly crops at the farm level throughout the region is likely to enhance pollinator diversity by lessening the negative effects of large monocultures. © The Authors 2016.		abundance, agricultural intensification, agricultural land, bee, crop production, ecological modeling, environmental effect, forage, grass, insect, landscape ecology, maize, pollinator, population decline, soybean, species richness, Brookings County, South Dakota, United States, Apoidea, Glycine max, Halictidae, Hexapoda, Melissodes, Syrphidae, Zea mays, agriculture, alfalfa, animal, bee, biodiversity, crop, growth, development and aging, maize, physiology, pollination, population density, procedures, South Dakota, soybean, Agriculture, Animals, Bees, Biodiversity, Crops, Agricultural, Medicago sativa, Pollination, Population Density, South Dakota, Soybeans, Zea mays	2016-08-01
The neonicotinoid pesticide, imidacloprid, affects Bombus impatiens (bumblebee) sonication behavior when consumed at doses below the LD50	We investigated changes in sonication (or buzz-pollination) behavior of Bombus impatiens bumblebees, after consumption of the neonicotinoid pesticide, imidacloprid. We measured sonication frequency, sonication length, and flight (wing beat) frequency of marked bees collecting pollen from Solanum lycopsersicum (tomato), and then randomly assigned bees to consume 0, 0.0515, 0.515, or 5.15 ng of imidacloprid. We recorded the number of bees in each treatment group that resumed sonication behavior after consuming imidacloprid, and re-measured sonication and flight behavior for these bees. We did not find evidence that consuming 0.0515 ng imidacloprid affected the sonication length, sonication frequency, or flight frequency for bees that sonicated after consuming imidacloprid; we were unable to test changes in these variables for bees that consumed 0.515 or 5.15 ng because we did not observe enough of these bees sonicating after treatment. We performed Cox proportional hazard regression to determine whether consuming imidacloprid affected the probability of engaging in further sonication behavior on S. lycopersicum and found that bumblebees who consumed 0.515 or 5.15 ng of imidacloprid were significantly less likely to sonicate after treatment than bees who consumed no imidacloprid. At the end of the experiment, we classified bees as dead or alive; our data suggest a trend of increasing mortality with higher doses of imidacloprid. Our results show that even modest doses of imidacloprid can significantly affect the likelihood of bumblebees engaging in sonication, a behavior critical for the pollination of a variety of crops and other plants. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.		imidacloprid, imidacloprid, imidazole derivative, insecticide, nitro derivative, bee, behavioral response, crop plant, ecotoxicology, imidacloprid, mortality, native species, pollination, vibration, animal behavior, Article, Bombus impatiens, colony formation, controlled study, environmental exposure, flight, foraging behavior, LD50, long term exposure, mortality, nonhuman, organism colony, physical parameters, pollination, priority journal, probability, proportional hazards model, sonication frequency, sonication length, tomato, ultrasound, wingbeat frequency, animal, animal behavior, bee, crop, dose response, drug effects, LD50, physiology, pollination, toxicity testing, ultrasound, Apoidea, Bombus impatiens, Lycopersicon, Lycopersicon esculentum, Solanum, Animals, Bees, Behavior, Animal, Crops, Agricultural, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Imidazoles, Insecticides, Lethal Dose 50, Nitro Compounds, Pollination, Sonication, Toxicity Tests	2016-08-01
Pathogenesis of varroosis at the level of the honey bee (Apis mellifera) colony	The parasitic mite Varroa destructor, in interaction with different viruses, is the main cause of honey bee colony mortality in most parts of the world. Here we studied how effects of individual-level parasitization are reflected by the bee colony as a whole. We measured disease progression in an apiary of 24 hives with differing degree of mite infestation, and investigated its relationship to 28 biometrical, physiological and biochemical indicators. In early summer, when the most heavily infested colonies already showed reduced growth, an elevated ratio of brood to bees, as well as a strong presence of phenoloxidase/prophenoloxidase in hive bees were found to be predictors of the time of colony collapse. One month later, the learning performance of worker bees as well as the activity of glucose oxidase measured from head extracts were significantly linked to the timing of colony collapse. Colonies at the brink of collapse were characterized by reduced weight of winter bees and a strong increase in their relative body water content. Our data confirm the importance of the immune system, known from studies of individually-infested bees, for the pathogenesis of varroosis at colony level. However, they also show that single-bee effects cannot always be extrapolated to the colony as a whole. This fact, together with the prominent role of colony-level factors like the ratio between brood and bees for disease progression, stress the importance of the superorganismal dimension of Varroa research. ï¿½ 2016 Elsevier Ltd.		biochemical composition, biometry, disease transmission, enzyme activity, honeybee, immunity, learning, mite, morphology, mortality, parasite, pathogenicity, physiological response, virus, worker caste, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Deformed wing virus, Varroa, Varroa destructor, animal, bee, larva, parasitology, physiology, population dynamics, pupa, Varroidae, Animals, Bees, Larva, Population Dynamics, Pupa, Varroidae	2016-08-01
Hungry for quality—individual bumblebees forage flexibly to collect high-quality pollen	Abstract: Nutritional deficits may be one factor contributing to the ongoing decline of wild and managed bees. As a consequence, interest in understanding the effect of floral resource availability on nutritional intake - and subsequently bee health and performance - has increased. However, the proximate mechanisms underlying bee foraging choices are still poorly understood. We do, for instance, not yet know whether and how bees assess the nutritional quality of pollen or whether they use information on pollen quality to adjust foraging patterns. In a previous study, we showed that Bombus terrestris workers use their sense of taste to discriminate pollen differing in concentration and, thus, nutrient content. We now investigated whether they translate this ability into foraging behavior by observing microcolonies offered the choice between two feeders containing different pollen types and concentrations and, thus, qualities. We examined whether bumblebees used direct (chemotactile) or indirect (olfactory) cues to assess pollen quality and whether they individually assessed pollen quality or relied on larval feedback. By changing pollen quality after 21 days, we further tested whether information on pollen quality was subsequently associated with other (faster assessable) cues (e.g., odor) or continuously re-assessed. We found that bees always preferred pollen of higher quality and individually assessed quality based on chemotactile cues. Moreover, changing pollen quality resulted in rapid equivalent changes in foraging behavior, even without feedback from larvae. Consequently, individual bumblebee foragers continuously re-assess pollen quality to provide their colonies with high-quality food. Significance statement: The ongoing decline of wild and managed bees is likely driven by several factors with nutritional deficits being one of them. Because bees are amongst the most important pollinators, interest in understanding the effect of floral resource availability on nutritional intake and, subsequently, bee health and performance has increased. However, the proximate mechanisms underlying bee foraging choices are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how bumblebees differentiate between different pollen qualities by observing microcolonies offered the choice between different diets. We found that bees always preferred pollen of higher quality and individually assessed quality based on chemotactile cues. This finding increases our understanding of how social bees assess nutritional quality and make appropriate foraging choices. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.		bee, chemical cue, concentration (composition), food preference, food quality, foraging efficiency, nutritional status, olfactory cue, pollen, pollinator, population decline, protein, resource availability, Apoidea, Bombus terrestris	2016-08-01
Israeli acute paralysis virus associated paralysis symptoms, viral tissue distribution and Dicer-2 induction in bumblebee workers (Bombus terrestris)	Although it is known that Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) can cause bee mortality, the symptoms of paralysis and the distribution of the virus in different body tissues and their potential to respond with an increase of the siRNA antiviral immune system have not been studied. In this project we worked with Bombus terrestris, which is one of the most numerous bumblebee species in Europe and an important pollinator for wild flowers and many crops in agriculture. Besides the classic symptoms of paralysis and trembling prior to death, we report a new IAPV related symptom, crippled/immobilized forelegs. Reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR showed that IAPV accumulates in different body tissues (midgut, fat body, brain and ovary). The highest levels of IAPV were observed in the fat body. With fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) we detected IAPV in the Kenyon cells of mushroom bodies and neuropils from both antennal and optic lobes of the brain in IAPV-infected workers. Finally, we observed an induction of Dicer-2, a core gene of the RNAi antiviral immune response, in the IAPV-infected tissues of B. terrestris workers. According to our results, tissue tropism and the induction strength of Dicer-2 could not be correlated with virus-related paralysis symptoms. © Printed in Great Britain.		antenna (organ), Article, Bombus terrestris, crop, dicer 2 gene, Europe, fat pad, flower, fluorescence in situ hybridization, immune response gene, Israeli acute paralysis virus, kenyon cell, mortality, mushroom body, neuropil, nonhuman, optic lobe, paralysis, pollinator, polymerase chain reaction, priority journal, tissue distribution, tremor, viral tropism, virus infection, virus load, animal, animal structures, bee, Dicistroviridae, immunology, isolation and purification, pathogenicity, pathology, real time polymerase chain reaction, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RNA virus infection, veterinary, virology, ribonuclease III, virus RNA, Animal Structures, Animals, Bees, Dicistroviridae, Europe, In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, Ribonuclease III, RNA Virus Infections, RNA, Viral	2016-08-01
Comparison of Varroa destructor and Worker Honeybee Microbiota Within Hives Indicates Shared Bacteria	The ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor is a major pest of the honeybee Apis mellifera. In a previous study, bacteria were found in the guts of mites collected from winter beehive debris and were identified using Sanger sequencing of their 16S rRNA genes. In this study, community comparison and diversity analyses were performed to examine the microbiota of honeybees and mites at the population level. The microbiota of the mites and honeybees in 26 colonies in seven apiaries in Czechia was studied. Between 10 and 50 Varroa females were collected from the bottom board, and 10 worker bees were removed from the peripheral comb of the same beehive. Both bees and mites were surface sterilized. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene libraries revealed significant differences in the Varroa and honeybee microbiota. The Varroa microbiota was less diverse than was the honeybee microbiota, and the relative abundances of bacterial taxa in the mite and bee microbiota differed. The Varroa mites, but not the honeybees, were found to be inhabited by Diplorickettsia. The relative abundance of Arsenophonus, Morganella, Spiroplasma, Enterococcus, and Pseudomonas was higher in Varroa than in honeybees, and the Diplorickettsia symbiont detected in this study is specific to Varroa mites. The results demonstrated that there are shared bacteria between Varroa and honeybee populations but that these bacteria occur in different relative proportions in the honeybee and mite bacteriomes. These results support the suggestion of bacterial transfer via mites, although only some of the transferred bacteria may be harmful. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.		bacterial DNA, RNA 16S, animal, bee, biodiversity, classification, comparative study, DNA sequence, female, genetics, isolation and purification, male, microbiology, microflora, parasitology, season, Spiroplasma, symbiosis, Varroidae, Animals, Bees, Biodiversity, DNA, Bacterial, Female, Male, Microbiota, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Seasons, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Spiroplasma, Symbiosis, Varroidae	2016-08-01
Atrazine exposure affects longevity, development time and body size in Drosophila melanogaster	Atrazine is the one of the most widely used herbicides in the United States and non-target organisms may encounter it in the environment. Atrazine is known to affect male reproduction in both vertebrates and invertebrates but less is known about its effects on other fitness traits. Here we assessed the effects of five different chronic exposure levels on a variety of fitness traits in Drosophila melanogaster. We measured male and female longevity, development time, proportion pupated, proportion emerged, body size, female mating rate, fertility and fecundity. Atrazine exposure decreased the proportion pupated, the proportion emerged and adult survival. Development time was also affected by atrazine and exposed flies pupated and emerged earlier than controls. Although development time was accelerated, body size was actually larger in some of the exposures. Atrazine exposure had no effect on female mating rate and the effects on female fertility and fecundity were only observed in one of the two independent experimental blocks. Many of the traits showed non-monotonic dose response curves, where the intermediate concentrations showed the largest effects. Overall this study shows that atrazine influences a variety of life history traits in the model genetic system, D. melanogaster, and future studies should aim to identify the molecular mechanisms of toxicity. ï¿½ 2016 Elsevier Ltd.		atrazine, biological development, body size, ecotoxicology, fitness, fly, inclusive fitness, longevity, nontarget organism, pollution effect, pollution exposure, reproductive biology, survival, toxicity, vertebrate, United States, Drosophila melanogaster, Invertebrata, Vertebrata, atrazine, herbicide, animal, body size, Drosophila melanogaster, drug effects, female, fertility, growth, development and aging, larva, longevity, male, pupa, sexual behavior, Animals, Atrazine, Body Size, Drosophila melanogaster, Female, Fertility, Herbicides, Larva, Longevity, Male, Pupa, Sexual Behavior, Animal	2016-08-01
Parasite resistance and tolerance in honeybees at the individual and social level	Organisms living in large groups, such as social insects, are particularly vulnerable to parasite transmission. However, they have evolved diverse defence mechanisms which are not only restricted to the individual's immune response, but also include social defences. Here, we review cases of adaptations at the individual and social level in the honeybee Apis mellifera against the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor and the endoparasitic microsporidians Nosema ceranae and Nosema apis. They are considered important threats to honeybee health worldwide. We highlight how individual resistance may result in tolerance at the colony level and vice versa. © 2016 The Authors		animal, bee, host parasite interaction, Nosema, parasitology, physiology, social behavior, Varroidae, Animals, Bees, Host-Parasite Interactions, Nosema, Social Behavior, Varroidae	2016-08-01
Approaches and Challenges to Managing Nosema (Microspora: Nosematidae) Parasites in Honey Bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Colonies	The microsporidia Nosema apis (Zander) and Nosema ceranae (Fries) are common intestinal parasites in honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies. Though globally prevalent, there are mixed reports of Nosema infection costs, with some regions reporting high parasite virulence and colony losses, while others report high Nosema prevalence but few costs. Basic and applied studies are urgently needed to help beekeepers effectively manage Nosema spp., ideally through an integrated pest management approach that allows beekeepers to deploy multiple strategies to control Nosema when Nosema is likely to cause damage to the colonies, rather than using prophylactic treatments. Beekeepers need practical and affordable technologies that facilitate disease diagnosis and science-backed guidelines that recommend when, if at all, to treat infections. In addition, new treatment methods are needed, as there are several problems associated with the chemical use of fumagillin (the only currently extensively studied, but not globally available treatment) to control Nosema parasites. Though selective breeding of Nosema-resistant or tolerant bees may offer a long-term, sustainable solution to Nosema management, other treatments are needed in the interim. Furthermore, the validation of alternative treatment efficacy in field settings is needed along with toxicology assays to ensure that treatments do not have unintended, adverse effects on honey bees or humans. Finally, given variation in Nosema virulence, development of regional management guidelines, rather than universal guidelines, may provide optimal and cost-effective Nosema management, though more research is needed before regional plans can be developed. ï¿½ 2016 The Authors.

Neonicotinoid-contaminated pollinator strips adjacent to cropland reduce honey bee nutritional status	Worldwide pollinator declines are attributed to a number of factors, including pesticide exposures. Neonicotinoid insecticides specifically have been detected in surface waters, non-target vegetation, and bee products, but the risks posed by environmental exposures are still not well understood. Pollinator strips were tested for clothianidin contamination in plant tissues, and the risks to honey bees assessed. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) quantified clothianidin in leaf, nectar, honey, and bee bread at organic and seed-treated farms. Total glycogen, lipids, and protein from honey bee workers were quantified. The proportion of plants testing positive for clothianidin were the same between treatments. Leaf tissue and honey had similar concentrations of clothianidin between organic and seed-treated farms. Honey (mean±SE: 6.61 ± 0.88 ppb clothianidin per hive) had seven times greater concentrations than nectar collected by bees (0.94 ± 0.09 ppb). Bee bread collected from organic sites (25.8 ± 3.0 ppb) had significantly less clothianidin than those at seed treated locations (41.6 ± 2.9 ppb). Increasing concentrations of clothianidin in bee bread were correlated with decreased glycogen, lipid, and protein in workers. This study shows that small, isolated areas set aside for conservation do not provide spatial or temporal relief from neonicotinoid exposures in agricultural regions where their use is largely prophylactic.			2016-07-14
Macronutrient ratios in pollen shape bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) foraging strategies and floral preferences	To fuel their activities and rear their offspring, foraging bees must obtain a sufficient quality and quantity of nutritional resources from a diverse plant community. Pollen is the primary source of proteins and lipids for bees, and the concentrations of these nutrients in pollen can vary widely among host-plant species. Therefore we hypothesized that foraging decisions of bumble bees are driven by both the protein and lipid content of pollen. By successively reducing environmental and floral cues, we analyzed pollen-foraging preferences of Bombus impatiens in (i) host-plant species, (ii) pollen isolated from these host-plant species, and (iii) nutritionally modified single-source pollen diets encompassing a range of protein and lipid concentrations. In our semifield experiments, B. impatiens foragers exponentially increased their foraging rates of pollen from plant species with high protein: lipid (P:L) ratios; the most preferred plant species had the highest ratio (∼4.6:1). These preferences were confirmed in cage studies where, in pairwise comparisons in the absence of other floral cues, B. impatiens workers still preferred pollen with higher P:L ratios. Finally, when presented with nutritionally modified pollen, workers were most attracted to pollen with P:L ratios of 5:1 and 10:1, but increasing the protein or lipid concentration (while leaving ratios intact) reduced attraction. Thus, macronutritional ratios appear to be a primary factor driving bee pollen-foraging behavior and may explain observed patterns of host-plant visitation across the landscape. The nutritional quality of pollen resources should be taken into consideration when designing conservation habitats supporting bee populations. © 2016, National Academy of Sciences.

A 10 year survey of acaricide residues in beeswax analysed in Italy	BACKGROUND: The aim of this work was to provide an overview of the prevalence and level of acaricides in beeswax used in Italy in the past 10 years by analysing 1319 beeswax samples processed by the certified laboratory of the Italian Bee Research Institute. RESULTS: The proportion of samples positive to at least one active ingredient decreased between 2005 and 2009 (from 69 to 32%) and then increased again between 2009 and 2014 (from 32 to 91%). This trend is in agreement with reports from beekeepers that the use of synthetic acaricides decreased in the second half of the past decade and increased after the beginning of the colony losses phenomenon. The active ingredient with the greatest overall proportion of positive samples was coumaphos (49%), followed by fluvalinate (38%) and chlorphenvinphos (25%). The indicator for amitraz, 2,4-dimethylphenylformamide (DMPF), was detected in a very small proportion of samples (6%), while residues of cymiazole were never found. CONCLUSIONS: In more than half of the analysed samples, residues of at least one active ingredient were detected. The mean levels of residues of all the considered active ingredients in the positive samples may represent a source of accumulation in beeswax and pose risks to honey bee health. ï¿½ 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.		acaricide, apiculture, bioaccumulation, biomonitoring, colony, field survey, gas chromatography, health risk, honeybee, mite, organic farming, pesticide residue, pollution effect, research institution, wax, Italy, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Varroa destructor, acaricide, amitraz, clofenvinfos, coumafos, cymiazole, fluvalinate, nitrile, pesticide residue, propolis, pyrethroid, thiazole derivative, toluidine derivative, wax, chemistry, Italy, questionnaire, Acaricides, Chlorfenvinphos, Coumaphos, Italy, Nitriles, Pesticide Residues, Pyrethrins, Surveys and Questionnaires, Thiazoles, Toluidines, Waxes	2016-07-01
Multiple stressors: using the honeybee model BEEHAVE to explore how spatial and temporal forage stress affects colony resilience	The causes underlying the increased mortality of honeybee Apis mellifera colonies observed over the past decade remain unclear. Since so far the evidence for monocausal explanations is equivocal, involvement of multiple stressors is generally assumed. We here focus on various aspects of forage availability, which have received less attention than other stressors because it is virtually impossible to explore them empirically. We applied the colony model BEEHAVE, which links within-hive dynamics and foraging, to stylized landscape settings to explore how foraging distance, forage supply, and “forage gaps”, i.e. periods in which honeybees cannot find any nectar and pollen, affect colony resilience and the mechanisms behind. We found that colony extinction was mainly driven by foraging distance, but the timing of forage gaps had strongest effects on time to extinction. Sensitivity to forage gaps of 15 days was highest in June or July even if otherwise forage availability was sufficient to survive. Forage availability affected colonies via cascading effects on queen's egg-laying rate, reduction of new-emerging brood stages developing into adult workers, pollen debt, lack of workforce for nursing, and reduced foraging activity. Forage gaps in July led to reduction in egg-laying and increased mortality of brood stages at a time when the queen's seasonal egg-laying rate is at its maximum, leading to colony failure over time. Our results demonstrate that badly timed forage gaps interacting with poor overall forage supply reduce honeybee colony resilience. Existing regulation mechanisms which in principle enable colonies to cope with varying forage supply in a given landscape and year, such as a reduction in egg-laying, have only a certain capacity. Our results are hypothetical, as they are obtained from simplified landscape settings, but they are consistent with existing empirical knowledge. They offer ample opportunities for testing the predicted effects of forage stress in controlled experiments. © 2015 The Authors		colony, ecological modeling, ecosystem resilience, egg production, environmental stress, extinction, food availability, forage, foraging behavior, honeybee, mortality, nectar, queen, survival, Apis mellifera	2016-07-01
Parasites modulate within-colony activity and accelerate the temporal polyethism schedule of a social insect, the honey bee	Task allocation in social insect colonies is generally organised into an age-related division of labour, termed the temporal polyethism schedule, which may in part have evolved to reduce infection of the colony’s brood by pests and pathogens. The temporal polyethism schedule is sensitive to colony perturbations that may lead to adaptive changes in task allocation, maintaining colony homeostasis. Though social insects can be infected by a range of parasites, little is known of how these parasites impact within-colony behaviour and the temporal polyethism schedule. We use honey bees (Apis mellifera) experimentally infected by two of their emerging pathogens, Deformed wing virus (DWV), which is relatively understudied concerning its behavioural impact on its host, and the exotic microsporidian Nosema ceranae. We examined parasite effects on host temporal polyethism and patterns of activity within the colony. We found that pathogens accelerated the temporal polyethism schedule, but without reducing host behavioural repertoire. Infected hosts exhibited increased hyperactivity, allocating more time to self-grooming and foraging-related tasks. The strength of behavioural alterations we observed was found to be pathogen specific; behavioural modifications were more pronounced in virus-treated hosts versus N. ceranae-treated hosts, with potential benefits for the colony in terms of reducing within-colony transmission. Investigating the effects of multiple pathogens on behavioural patterns of social insects could play a crucial role in understanding pathogen spread within a colony and their effects on colony social organisation. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.		colony, homeostasis, honeybee, host-parasite interaction, parasite, pathogen, pest species, polyethism, social insect, social organization, virus, Apis mellifera, Deformed wing virus, Hexapoda, Nosema ceranae	2016-07-01
Effects of wintering environment and parasite-Pathogen interactions on honey bee colony loss in north temperate regions	Extreme winter losses of honey bee colonies are a major threat to beekeeping but the combinations of factors underlying colony loss remain debatable. We monitored colonies in two environments (colonies wintered indoors or outdoors) and characterized the effects of two parasitic mites, seven viruses, and Nosema on honey bee colony mortality and population loss over winter. Samples were collected from two locations within hives in fall, mid-winter and spring of 2009/2010. Although fall parasite and pathogen loads were similar in outdoor and indoor-wintered colonies, the outdoor-wintered colonies had greater relative reductions in bee population score over winter. Seasonal patterns in deformed wing virus (DWV), black queen cell virus (BQCV), and Nosema level also differed with the wintering environment. DWV and Nosema levels decreased over winter for indoor-wintered colonies but BQCV did not. Both BQCV and Nosema concentration increased over winter in outdoor-wintered colonies. The mean abundance of Varroa decreased and concentration of Sacbrood virus (SBV), Kashmir bee virus (KBV), and Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) increased over winter but seasonal patterns were not affected by wintering method. For most viruses, either entrance or brood area samples were reasonable predictors of colony virus load but there were significant season∗sample location interactions for Nosema and BQCV, indicating that care must be taken when selecting samples from a single location. For Nosema spp., the fall entrance samples were better predictors of future infestation levels than were fall brood area samples. For indoor-wintered colonies, Israeli acute paralysis virus IAPV concentration was negatively correlated with spring population size. For outdoor-wintered hives, spring Varroa abundance and DWV concentration were positively correlated with bee loss and negatively correlated with spring population size. Multivariate analyses for fall collected samples indicated higher DWV was associated with colony death as did high SBV for spring-collected samples. © 2016 Desai, Currie.

Elevated virulence of an emerging viral genotype as a driver of honeybee loss	Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have contributed significantly to the current biodiversity crisis, leading to widespread epidemics and population loss. Owing to genetic variation in pathogen virulence, a complete understanding of species decline requires the accurate identification and characterization of EIDs. We explore this issue in the Western honeybee, where increasing mortality of populations in the Northern Hemisphere has caused major concern. Specifically, we investigate the importance of genetic identity of the main suspect in mortality, deformed wing virus (DWV), in driving honeybee loss. Using laboratory experiments and a systematic field survey, we demonstrate that an emerging DWV genotype (DWV-B) is more virulent than the established DWV genotype (DWV-A) and is widespread in the landscape. Furthermore, we show in a simple model that colonies infected with DWV-B collapse sooner than colonies infected with DWV-A. We also identify potential for rapid DWV evolution by revealing extensive genome-wide recombination in vivo. The emergence of DWV-B in naive honeybee populations, including via recombination with DWV-A, could be of significant ecological and economic importance. Our findings emphasize that knowledge of pathogen genetic identity and diversity is critical to understanding drivers of species decline. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Engaging indigenous and academic knowledge on bees in the Amazon: Implications for environmental management and transdisciplinary research	Background: This paper contributes to the development of theoretical and methodological approaches that aim to engage indigenous, technical and academic knowledge for environmental management. We present an exploratory analysis of a transdisciplinary project carried out to identify and contrast indigenous and academic perspectives on the relationship between the Africanized honey bee and stingless bee species in the Brazilian Amazon. The project was developed by practitioners and researchers of the Instituto Socioambiental (ISA, a Brazilian NGO), responding to a concern raised by a funding agency, regarding the potential impact of apiculture development by indigenous peoples, on the diversity of stingless bee species in the Xingu Park, southern Brazilian Amazon. Research and educational activities were carried out among four indigenous peoples: Kawaiwete or Kaiabi, Yudja or Juruna, Kīsêdjê or Suyá and Ikpeng or Txicão. Methods: A constructivist qualitative approach was developed, which included academic literature review, conduction of semi-structured interviews with elders and leaders, community focus groups, field walks and workshops in schools in four villages. Semi-structured interviews and on-line surveys were carried out among academic experts and practitioners. Results: We found that in both indigenous and scientific perspectives, diversity is a key aspect in keeping exotic and native species in balance and thus avoiding heightened competition and extinction. The Africanized honey bee was compared to the non-indigenous westerners who colonized the Americas, with whom indigenous peoples had to learn to coexist. We identify challenges and opportunities for engagement of indigenous and scientific knowledge for research and management of bee species in the Amazon. A combination of small-scale apiculture and meliponiculture is viewed as an approach that might help to maintain biological and cultural diversity in Amazonian landscapes. Conclusion: The articulation of knowledge from non-indigenous practitioners and researchers with that of indigenous peoples might inform sustainable management practices that are, at the same time, respectful of indigenous perspectives and intellectual property rights. However, there are ontological, epistemological, political and financial barriers and constraints that need to be addressed in transdisciplinary research projects inter-relating academic, technical and indigenous knowledge systems for environmental management. © 2016 The Author(s).		animal, bee, Brazil, environment, knowledge, research, Animals, Bees, Brazil, Environment, Knowledge, Research	2016-06-20
Why do Varroa mites prefer nurse bees?	The Varroa mite, Varroa destructor, is an acarine ecto-parasite on Apis mellifera. It is the worst pest of Apis mellifera, yet its reproductive biology on the host is not well understood. In particular, the significance of the phoretic stage, when mites feed on adult bees for a few days, is not clear. In addition, it is not clear whether the preference of mites for nurses observed in the laboratory also happens inside real colonies. We show that Varroa mites prefer nurses over both newly emerged bees and forgers in a colony setting. We then determined the mechanism behind this preference. We show that this preference maximizes Varroa fitness, although due to the fact that each mite must find a second host (a pupa) to reproduce, the fitness benefit to the mites is not immediate but delayed. Our results suggest that the Varroa mite is a highly adapted parasite for honey bees.		human, human experiment, nurse, parasite, Varroa	2016-06-15
B+WSN: Smart beehive with preliminary decision tree analysis for agriculture and honey bee health monitoring	United Nations reports throughout recent years have stressed the growing constraint of food supply for Earth's growing human population. Honey bees are a vital part of the food chain as the most important pollinator for a wide range of crops. It is clear that protecting the population of honey bees worldwide, as well as enabling them to maximise their productivity, is an important concern. In this paper heterogeneous wireless sensor networks are utilised to collect data on a range of parameters from a beehive with the aim of accurately describing the internal conditions and colony activity. The parameters measured were: CO2, O2, pollutant gases, temperature, relative humidity, and acceleration. Weather data (sunshine, rain, and temperature) were also collected to provide an additional analysis dimension. Using a data set from a deployment at a field-deployed beehive, a biological analysis was undertaken to classify ten important hive states. This classification led to the development of a decision tree based classification algorithm which could describe the beehive using sensor network data with 95.38% accuracy. Finally, a correlation between meteorological conditions and beehive data was observed. This led to the development of an algorithm for predicting short term rain based on the parameters within the hive. Envisioned applications of this algorithm include agricultural and environmental monitoring for short term local forecasts (95.4% accuracy). Experimental results shows the low computational and energy overhead (5.35% increase in energy consumption) of the classification algorithm when deployed on one network node, which allows the node to be a self-sustainable intelligent device for smart bee hives. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..

Sucrose sensitivity of honey bees is differently affected by dietary protein and a neonicotinoid pesticide	Over a decade, declines in honey bee colonies have raised worldwide concerns. Several potentially contributing factors have been investigated, e.g. parasites, diseases, and pesticides. Neonicotinoid pesticides have received much attention due to their intensive use in crop protection, and their adverse effects on many levels of honey bee physiology led the European Union to ban these compounds. Due to their neuronal target, a receptor expressed throughout the insect nervous system, studies have focused mainly on neuroscience and behaviour. Through the Geometric Framework of nutrition, we investigated effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on survival, food consumption and sucrose sensitivity of honey bees (Apis mellifera). Thiamethoxam did not affect protein and carbohydrate intake, but decreased responses to high concentrations of sucrose. Interestingly, when bees ate fixed unbalanced diets, dietary protein facilitated better sucrose detection. Both thiamethoxam and dietary protein influenced survival. These findings suggest that, in the presence of a pesticide and unbalanced food, honey bee health may be severely challenged. Consequences for foraging efficiency and colony activity, cornerstones of honey bee health, are also discussed. ï¿½ 2016 Dï¿½mares et al.

Specific immune stimulation by endogenous bacteria in honey bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae)	Honey bees are highly important pollinators in agroecosystems, but they are currently under growing environmental pressures (e.g., from pesticides, poor nutrition, and parasites). Due to the multiplicity of environmental stress factors, their protection requires diverse and integrative approaches. Among those is the development of immunomodulatory tools, as immunosuppression is often observed in stressed bees. Toward this goal, the use of exogenous bacteria with immunomodulatory potential has recently been investigated, but knowledge about the potential of honey bee endogenous bacteria is limited. We therefore tested the influence of single strains of five species of endogenous lactic acid bacteria strains on the bee immune system during the larval stage. We measured the expression level of seven immune-related genes and the gene encoding the storage protein Hexamerin 70b. Two of the strains induced an immune stimulation, but this was limited to the antimicrobial peptide Apidaecin1. Upregulation of Apidaecin1 was associated to the downregulation of Hexamerin 70b. Those results suggest that the bee response to endogenous bacteria is specific both at the species and immune levels. As immune responses are costly, this specificity may be adaptive for saving energy and avoiding any negative side effects on the host development or survival. Further screening of bacteria immunomodulatory potential is needed, but associated immune cost needs to be taken into account for improving honey bee resilience to environmental stress. © The Authors 2016.

Sperm viability and gene expression in honey bee queens (Apis mellifera) following exposure to the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid and the organophosphate acaricide coumaphos	Honey bee population declines are of global concern. Numerous factors appear to cause these declines including parasites, pathogens, malnutrition and pesticides. Residues of the organophosphate acaricide coumaphos and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, widely used to combat Varroa mites and for crop protection in agriculture, respectively, have been detected in wax, pollen and comb samples. Here, we assess the effects of these compounds at different doses on the viability of sperm stored in the honey bee queens' spermatheca. Our results demonstrate that sub-lethal doses of imidacloprid (0.02 ppm) decreased sperm viability by 50%, 7 days after treatment. Sperm viability was a downward trend (about 33%) in queens treated with high doses of coumaphos (100 ppm), but there was not significant difference. The expression of genes that are involved in development, immune responses and detoxification in honey bee queens and workers exposed to chemicals was measured by qPCR analysis. The data showed that expression levels of specific genes were triggered 1 day after treatment. The expression levels of P450 subfamily genes, CYP306A1, CYP4G11 and CYP6AS14 were decreased in honey bee queens treated with low doses of coumaphos (5 ppm) and imidacloprid (0.02 ppm). Moreover, these two compounds suppressed the expression of genes related to antioxidation, immunity and development in queens at day 1. Up-regulation of antioxidants by these compounds in worker bees was observed at day 1. Coumaphos also caused a repression of CYP306A1 and CYP4G11 in workers. Antioxidants appear to prevent chemical damage to honey bees. We also found that DWV replication increased in workers treated with imidacloprid. This research clearly demonstrates that chemical exposure can affect sperm viability in queen honey bees. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.		acaricide, antioxidant, chemical compound, detoxification, dose-response relationship, gene expression, honeybee, imidacloprid, immune response, malnutrition, pollen, population decline, sperm, sublethal effect, viability, wax, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Deformed wing virus, Varroa, acaricide, coumafos, imidacloprid, imidazole derivative, insecticide, nitro derivative, animal, bee, cell survival, down regulation, female, gene expression regulation, genetics, male, physiology, randomization, spermatozoon, upregulation, Acaricides, Animals, Bees, Cell Survival, Coumaphos, Down-Regulation, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Imidazoles, Insecticides, Male, Nitro Compounds, Random Allocation, Spermatozoa, Up-Regulation	2016-06-01
Selective Behaviour of Honeybees in Acquiring European Propolis Plant Precursors	Honey bees harvest resins from various plant species and use them in the hive as propolis. While there have been a number of studies concerning the chemical composition of this antimicrobial product, little is known about selective behavior and bee preference when different potential plant sources of resin are available. The main objective of this paper was to investigate some aspects of behavioral patterns of honeybees in the context of resin acquisition. Samples of propolis originating from temperate zones of Europe and the supposed botanical precursors of the product were analyzed. Taxonomical markers of bud resins of two white birch species, aspen, black poplar, horse-chestnut, black alder, and Scots pine were determined through GC-MS analysis. All these trees have been reported as sources of propolis, but comparisons of the chemical composition of their bud resins with the compositions of propolis samples from seven European countries have demonstrated the presence of taxonomical markers only from black poplar, aspen, and one species of birch. This suggests selective behavior during the collection of bud resins by honeybees. To examine the causes of such selectivity, the antimicrobial properties of bud resins were determined. Horse-chestnut resins had lower antimicrobial activity than the other resins which did not differ significantly. © 2016, The Author(s).		antimicrobial activity, biochemical composition, bud, coniferous tree, deciduous tree, gas chromatography, genetic marker, honeybee, mass spectrometry, resin, Europe, Aesculus, Aesculus hippocastanum, Alnus glutinosa, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Betula pendula, Betula pubescens, Pinus sylvestris, Populus nigra, Populus tremula, antiinfective agent, propolis, animal, animal behavior, bee, biosynthesis, chemistry, drug effects, metabolism, plant, Animals, Anti-Infective Agents, Bees, Behavior, Animal, Plants, Propolis	2016-06-01
Honeybees produce millimolar concentrations of non-neuronal acetylcholine for breeding: Possible adverse effects of neonicotinoids	The worldwide use of neonicotinoid pesticides has caused concern on account of their involvement in the decline of bee populations, which are key pollinators in most ecosystems. Here we describe a role of non-neuronal acetylcholine (ACh) for breeding of Apis mellifera carnica and a so far unknown effect of neonicotinoids on non-target insects. Royal jelly or larval food are produced by the hypopharyngeal gland of nursing bees and contain unusually high ACh concentrations (4-8 mM). ACh is extremely well conserved in royal jelly or brood food because of the acidic pH of 4.0. This condition protects ACh from degradation thus ensuring delivery of intact ACh to larvae. Raising the pH to 5.5 and applying cholinesterase reduced the content of ACh substantially (by 75-90%) in larval food. When this manipulated brood was tested in artificial larval breeding experiments, the survival rate was higher with food supplemented by 100% with ACh (6 mM) than with food not supplemented with ACh. ACh release from the hypopharyngeal gland and its content in brood food declined by 80%, when honeybee colonies were exposed for 4 weeks to high concentrations of the neonicotinoids clothianidin (100 parts per billion [ppb]) or thiacloprid (8,800 ppb). Under these conditions the secretory cells of the gland were markedly damaged and brood development was severely compromised. Even field-relevant low concentrations of thiacloprid (200 ppb) or clothianidin (1 and 10 ppb) reduced ACh level in the brood food and showed initial adverse effects on brood development. Our findings indicate a hitherto unknown target of neonicotinoids to induce adverse effects on non-neuronal ACh which should be considered when re-assessing the environmental risks of these compounds. To our knowledge this is a new biological mechanism, and we suggest that, in addition to their well documented neurotoxic effects, neonicotinoids may contribute to honeybee colony losses consecutive to a reduction of the ACh content in the brood food. © 2016 Wessler et al.		acetylcholine, neonicotinoid, acetylcholine, anabasine, choline acetyltransferase, insecticide, nitro derivative, acidity, animal experiment, animal tissue, Apis mellifera, Article, breeding, concentration (parameters), controlled study, degradation kinetics, hypopharynx, larval stage, nonhuman, pH measurement, secretory cell, smooth muscle contraction, survival rate, analogs and derivatives, animal, bee, biosynthesis, drug effects, female, guinea pig, larva, male, metabolism, muscle contraction, nerve cell, physiology, pollination, reproduction, smooth muscle, Acetylcholine, Anabasine, Animals, Bees, Choline O-Acetyltransferase, Female, Guinea Pigs, Hypopharynx, Insecticides, Larva, Male, Muscle Contraction, Muscle, Smooth, Neurons, Nitro Compounds, Pollination, Reproduction	2016-06-01
Varroa destructor and viruses association in honey bee colonies under different climatic conditions	Honey bee colonies are threatened by multiple factors including complex interactions between environmental and diseases such as parasitic mites and viruses. We compared the presence of honeybee-pathogenic viruses and Varroa infestation rate in four apiaries: commercial colonies that received treatment against Varroa and non-treated colonies that did not received any treatment for the last 4 years located in temperate and subtropical climate. In addition, we evaluated the effect of climate and Varroa treatment on deformed wing virus (DWV) amounts. In both climates, DWV was the most prevalent virus, being the only present virus in subtropical colonies. Moreover, colonies from subtropical climate also showed reduced DWV amounts and lower Varroa infestation rates than colonies from temperate climate. Nevertheless, non-treated colonies in both climate conditions are able to survive several years. Environment appears as a key factor interacting with local bee populations and influencing colony survival beyond Varroa and virus presence. ï¿½ 2016 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.		animal, bee, classification, climate, growth, development and aging, isolation and purification, parasitology, Varroidae, virology, virus, Animals, Bees, Climate, Varroidae, Viruses	2016-06-01
Isoform-specific modulation of the chemical sensitivity of conserved TRPA1 channel in the major honeybee ectoparasitic mite, Tropilaelaps mercedesae	We identified and characterized the TRPA1 channel of Tropilaelaps mercedesae (TmTRPA1), one of two major species of honeybee ectoparasitic mite. Three TmTRPA1 isoforms with unique N-terminal sequences were activated by heat, and the isoform highly expressed in the mite's front legs, TmTRPA1b, was also activated by 27 plant-derived compounds including electrophiles. This suggests that the heat- and electrophile-dependent gating mechanisms as nocisensitive TRPA1 channel are well conserved between arthropod species. Intriguingly, one TmTRPA1 isoform, TmTRPA1a, was activated by only six compounds compared with two other isoforms, demonstrating that the N-terminal sequences are critical determinants for the chemical sensitivity. This is the first example of isoform-specific modulation of chemical sensitivity of TRPA1 channel in one species. α-terpineol showed repellent activity towards T. mercedesae in a laboratory assay and repressed T. mercedesae entry for reproduction into the brood cells with fifth instar larvae in hives. Thus, α-terpineol could be used as the potential compound to control two major honeybee ectoparasitic mites, T. mercedesae and Varroa destructor, in the apiculture industry. ©2016 The Authors.		alpha-terpineol, arthropod protein, cyclohexene derivative, isoprotein, terpene, transient receptor potential channel A1, alternative RNA splicing, animal, chemistry, drug effects, gene expression regulation, genetics, metabolism, mite, tissue distribution, Alternative Splicing, Animals, Arthropod Proteins, Cyclohexenes, Gene Expression Regulation, Mites, Monoterpenes, Protein Isoforms, Tissue Distribution, TRPA1 Cation Channel	2016-06-01
Rapid and Reliable Method for Analyzing Acaricides in Honey-Based Products	The acaricide use (Amitraz, Bromopropylate, Coumaphos, Tau-fluvalinate, and Fipronil) is a common worldwide practice in honey cultivation for protect the production. Nevertheless, their presence decreases honey safety and quality and affects the human health. Therefore, it is important to set up an easy, reliable, and rapid analytical method for determining such compounds in bee’s products (honey, molasses, and royal jelly). The method, based on solid-phase extraction using Carbograph 1 as sorbent and analysis by gas chromatography coupled with ion trap mass spectrometer detector (GC/IT-MS), allows very efficient recoveries ranging between 99 and 106 % with relative standard deviation (RSD) ≤5 % for the standard solution and between 98 and 102 % with RSD ≤9 % for samples spiked with 40 ng g−1 of each acaricide. The adsorption isotherms and breakthrough curves for Carbograph 1 sugary solution are reported. The instrumental analytical protocol has been found to yield a linear calibration in the range 10–300 ng g−1 with r2 ≥ 0.991. The limits of detection vary between 1.4 and 5.3 ng g−1 (RSD ≤4 %), whereas the limits of quantification range between 4.6 and 9.4 ng g−1 (RSD ≤6 %); the intra-day and inter-day repeatabilities as RSD were below 9 and 15 %, respectively. The analytical method developed has been applied to several commercial and home-made bee products. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Food for pollinators: Quantifying the nectar and pollen resources of urban flower meadows	Planted meadows are increasingly used to improve the biodiversity and aesthetic amenity value of urban areas. Although many 'pollinator-friendly' seed mixes are available, the floral resources these provide to flower-visiting insects, and how these change through time, are largely unknown. Such data are necessary to compare the resources provided by alternative meadow seed mixes to each other and to other flowering habitats. We used quantitative surveys of over 2 million flowers to estimate the nectar and pollen resources offered by two exemplar commercial seed mixes (one annual, one perennial) and associated weeds grown as 300m2 meadows across four UK cities, sampled at six time points between May and September 2013. Nectar sugar and pollen rewards per flower varied widely across 65 species surveyed, with native British weed species (including dandelion, Taraxacum agg.) contributing the top five nectar producers and two of the top ten pollen producers. Seed mix species yielding the highest rewards per flower included Leontodon hispidus, Centaurea cyanus and C. nigra for nectar, and Papaver rhoeas, Eschscholzia californica and Malva moschata for pollen. Perennial meadows produced up to 20x more nectar and up to 6x more pollen than annual meadows, which in turn produced far more than amenity grassland controls. Perennial meadows produced resources earlier in the year than annual meadows, but both seed mixes delivered very low resource levels early in the year and these were provided almost entirely by native weeds. Pollen volume per flower is well predicted statistically by floral morphology, and nectar sugar mass and pollen volume per unit area are correlated with flower counts, raising the possibility that resource levels can be estimated for species or habitats where they cannot be measured directly. Our approach does not incorporate resource quality information (for example, pollen protein or essential amino acid content), but can easily do so when suitable data exist. Our approach should inform the design of new seed mixes to ensure continuity in floral resource availability throughout the year, and to identify suitable species to fill resource gaps in established mixes. © 2016 Hicks et al.

Non-cultivated plants present a season-long route of pesticide exposure for honey bees	Recent efforts to evaluate the contribution of neonicotinoid insecticides to worldwide pollinator declines have focused on honey bees and the chronic levels of exposure experienced when foraging on crops grown from neonicotinoid-treated seeds. However, few studies address non-crop plants as a potential route of pollinator exposure to neonicotinoid and other insecticides. Here we show that pollen collected by honey bee foragers in maize- and soybean-dominated landscapes is contaminated throughout the growing season with multiple agricultural pesticides, including the neonicotinoids used as seed treatments. Notably, however, the highest levels of contamination in pollen are pyrethroid insecticides targeting mosquitoes and other nuisance pests. Furthermore, pollen from crop plants represents only a tiny fraction of the total diversity of pollen resources used by honey bees in these landscapes, with the principle sources of pollen originating from non-cultivated plants. These findings provide fundamental information about the foraging habits of honey bees in these landscapes.		2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, acetamiprid, acetochlor, atrazine, carbamic acid, carbaril, chlorimuron ethyl, clothianidin, coumafos, cyhalothrin, diethyltoluamide, difenoconazole, dimethoate, dimpylate, dinotefuran, fluvalinate, imidacloprid, metalaxyl, methomyl, metolachlor, neonicotinoid, phenothrin, prallethrin, propiconazole, pyrethroid, spinosad, tetramethrin, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, trifloxystrobin, unclassified drug, foraging behavior, honeybee, insecticide, maize, mosquito, neonicotinoid pesticide, pest species, pollen, pollinator, pollution effect, pollution exposure, population decline, pyrethroid pesticide, soybean, alfalfa, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Article, clover, environmental exposure, forager, foraging, growing season, honeybee, landscape, maize, nonhuman, pollinator, soybean, species diversity, summer, Apis mellifera, Glycine max, Zea mays	2016-05-31

The status of honey bee health in Italy: Results from the nationwide bee monitoring network	In Italy a nation-wide monitoring network was established in 2009 in response to significant honey bee colony mortality reported during 2008. The network comprised of approximately100 apiaries located across Italy. Colonies were sampled four times per year, in order to assess the health status and to collect samples for pathogen, chemical and pollen analyses. The prevalence of Nosema ceranae ranged, on average, from 47-69% in 2009 and from 30-60% in 2010, with strong seasonal variation. Virus prevalence was higher in 2010 than in 2009. The most widespread viruses were BQCV, DWV and SBV. The most frequent pesticides in all hive contents were organophosphates and pyrethroids such as coumaphos and tau-fluvalinate. Beeswax was the most frequently contaminated hive product, with 40% of samples positive and 13% having multiple residues, while 27% of bee-bread and 12% of honey bee samples were contaminated. Colony losses in 2009/10 were on average 19%, with no major differences between regions of Italy. In 2009, the presence of DWV in autumn was positively correlated with colony losses. Similarly, hive mortality was higher in BQCV infected colonies in the first and second visits of the year. In 2010, colony losses were significantly related to the presence of pesticides in honey bees during the second sampling period. Honey bee exposure to poisons in spring could have a negative impact at the colony level, contributing to increase colony mortality during the beekeeping season. In both 2009and 2010, colony mortality rates were positively related to the percentage of agricultural land surrounding apiaries, supporting the importance of land use for honey bee health. © 2016 Porrini et al.

Weakness and collapse of bee colonies in Brazil: Are there cases of CCD?	In the last decades, the decline of wild bee populations and the collapse of Apis mellifera colonies have concerned researchers and beekeepers. The objective of this review was to compile some of the most relevant studies related to the possible causes of these problems - such as nutrition, management, pathogens, parasites, and the effects of pesticides -, besides presenting a brief history of the colony collapse disorder syndrome (CCD) in the United States and Europe. The studies developed in Brazil were presented in more detail, mainly those on pesticides used in agriculture and on pathogens and parasites that attack the colonies of Africanized A. mellifera. Cases of weakening, decline, and collapse have been recorded in Brazil, mainly in the states of Sï¿½o Paulo and Santa Catarina, which add up to great losses. Results of the analyzed occurrences indicated that the recorded mass mortalities were not associated with pathogens or parasites. Only two cases with characteristics similar to those described for CCD were recorded, but without defined causes. In order to know the causes of the weakening and collapses of colonies, the implementation of official programs is urgent for the systematic survey of bee health, associated with research focusing on assessments of possible impacts of habitat fragmentation and agricultural practices on bee communities.			2016-05-01
Chronic toxicity and physiological changes induced in the honey bee by the exposure to fipronil and Bacillus thuringiensis spores alone or combined	In the agricultural environment, honey bees may be exposed to combinations of pesticides. Until now, the effects of these combinations on honey bee health have been poorly investigated. In this study, we assessed the impacts of biological and chemical insecticides, combining low dietary concentrations of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) spores (100 and 1000 μg/L) with the chemical insecticide fipronil (1 μg/L). In order to assess the possible effects of Cry toxins, the Bt kurstaki strain (Btk) was compared with a Bt strain devoid of toxin-encoding plasmids (Bt Cry-). The oral exposure to fipronil and Bt spores from both strains for 10 days did not elicit significant effects on the feeding behavior and survival after 25 days. Local and systemic physiological effects were investigated by measuring the activities of enzymes involved in the intermediary and detoxication metabolisms at two sampling dates (day 10 and day 20). Attention was focused on head and midgut glutathione-S-transferase (GST), midgut alkaline phosphatase (ALP), abdomen glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). We found that Bt Cry- and Btk spores induced physiological modifications by differentially modulating enzyme activities. Fipronil influenced the enzyme activities differently at days 10 and 20 and, when combined with Bt spores, elicited modulations of some spore-induced physiological responses. These results show that an apparent absence of toxicity may hide physiological disruptions that could be potentially damaging for the bees, especially in the case of combined exposures to other environmental stressors. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.		alkaline phosphatase, fipronil, glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione transferase, glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase, antiparasitic agent, bacterial toxin, fipronil, glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase, insecticide, pesticide, pyrazole derivative, bacterium, biopesticide, enzyme activity, fipronil, honeybee, physiological response, spore, toxicity, Article, Bacillus thuringiensis, bacterial spore, chronic toxicity, controlled study, enzyme activity, enzyme regulation, feeding behavior, honeybee, nonhuman, physiological process, survival, toxicity testing, adverse effects, agriculture, animal, Bacillus thuringiensis, bacterial spore, bee, biological pest control, environmental exposure, metabolism, microbiology, physiology, procedures, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Bacillus thuringiensis, Agriculture, Animals, Antiparasitic Agents, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacterial Toxins, Bees, Environmental Exposure, Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase, Insecticides, Pest Control, Biological, Pesticides, Pyrazoles, Spores, Bacterial	2016-05-01
Acute exposure to selenium disrupts associative conditioning and long-term memory recall in honey bees (Apis mellifera)	A plethora of toxic compounds - including pesticides, heavy metals, and metalloids - have been detected in honey bees (Apis mellifera) and their colonies. One such compound is selenium, which bees are exposed to by consuming nectar and pollen from flowers grown in contaminated areas. Though selenium is lethal at high concentrations, sublethal exposure may also impair honey bees' ability to function normally. Examining the effect of selenium exposure on learning and memory provides a sensitive assay with which to identify sublethal effects on honey bee health and behavior. To determine whether sublethal selenium exposure causes learning and memory deficits, we used proboscis extension reflex conditioning coupled with recall tests 30 min and 24 h post-conditioning. We exposed forager honey bees to a single sublethal dose of selenium, and 3 h later we used an olfactory conditioning assay to train the bees to discriminate between one odor associated with sucrose-reinforcement and a second unreinforced odor. Following conditioning we tested short- and long-term recall of the task. Acute exposure to as little as 1.8 ng of an inorganic form of selenium (sodium selenate) before conditioning caused a reduction in behavioral performance during conditioning. And, exposure to 18 ng of either an inorganic form (sodium selenate) or an organic form (methylseleno- l-cysteine) of selenium caused a reduction in the bees' performance during the long-term recall test. These concentrations of selenium are lower than those found in the nectar of plants grown in selenium-contaminated soil, indicating that even low-grade selenium toxicity produces significant learning and memory impairments. This may reduce foragers' ability to effectively gather resources for the colony or nurse bees' ability to care for and maintain a healthy colony. © 2016.		cysteine derivative, methylseleno cysteine, selenate, unclassified drug, pollutant, selenium, heavy metal, honeybee, learning, memory, pesticide, selenium, sublethal effect, toxicity, animal behavior, Apis mellifera, Article, associative conditioning, bioassay, concentration (parameters), conditioning, controlled study, forager, learning disorder, lethal dose, long term memory, memory consolidation, memory disorder, nonhuman, olfactory discrimination, toxicity testing, animal, bee, drug effects, learning, pollutant, smelling, statistical model, toxicity, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Animals, Association Learning, Bees, Environmental Pollutants, Logistic Models, Memory, Long-Term, Olfactory Perception, Selenium	2016-05-01
A toolbox for quantitative gene expression in varroa destructor: RNA degradation in field samples and systematic analysis of reference gene stability	Varroa destructor is the major pest of Apis mellifera and contributes to the global honey bee health crisis threatening food security. Developing new control strategies to combat Varroa will require the application of molecular biology, including gene expression studies by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Both high quality RNA samples and suitable stable internal reference genes are required for accurate gene expression studies. In this study, ten candidate genes (succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA), NADH dehydrogenase (NADH), large ribsosmal subunit, TATA-binding protein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 18S rRNA (18S), heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90), cyclophilin, α-tubulin, actin), were evaluated for their suitability as normalization genes using the geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, and comparative ÄCq algorithims. Our study proposes the use of no more than two of the four most stable reference genes (NADH, 18S, SDHA and HSP90) in Varroa gene expression studies. These four genes remain stable in phoretic and reproductive stage Varroa and are unaffected by Deformed wing virus load. When used for determining changes in vitellogenin gene expression, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the relatively unstable genes actin and α-tubulin was much lower than for the stable gene combinations (NADH + HSP90 +18S; NADH + HSP90; or NADH). Using both electropherograms and RT-qPCR for short and long amplicons as quality controls, we demonstrate that high quality RNA can be recovered from Varroa up to 10 days later stored at ambient temperature if collected into RNAlater and provided the body is pierced. This protocol allows the exchange of Varroa samples between international collaborators and field sample collectors without requiring frozen collection or shipping. Our results make important contributions to gene expression studies in Varroa by proposing a validated sampling protocol to obtain high quality Varroa RNA and the validation of suitable reference genes for expression studies in this globally important pest. © 2016 Campbell et al.

Natural Varroa mite-surviving Apis mellifera honeybee populations	The Varroa destructor mite is the largest threat to apiculture worldwide and has been responsible for devastating losses of wild honeybee populations in Europe and North America. However, Varroa mite-resistant populations of A. mellifera honeybees have been reported and documented around the world with a variety of explanations for their long-term survival with uncontrolled mite infestation. This review synthesizes the work on naturally occurring survival to Varroa mites and discusses what these honeybee populations can signify for apiculture. © 2015, The Author(s).		apiculture, honeybee, host-parasite interaction, mite, natural selection, pest resistance, survival, wild population, Europe, North America, Acari, Apis mellifera, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2016-05-01
Disease dynamics of honeybees with Varroa destructor as parasite and virus vector	The worldwide decline in honeybee colonies during the past 50 years has often been linked to the spread of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and its interaction with certain honeybee viruses carried by Varroa mites. In this paper, we propose a honeybee-mite-virus model that incorporates (1) parasitic interactions between honeybees and the Varroa mites; (2) five virus transmission terms between honeybees and mites at different stages of Varroa mites: from honeybees to honeybees, from adult honeybees to the phoretic mites, from brood to the reproductive mites, from the reproductive mites to brood, and from adult honeybees to the phoretic mites; and (3) Allee effects in the honeybee population generated by its internal organization such as division of labor. We provide completed local and global analysis for the full system and its subsystems. Our analytical and numerical results allow us have a better understanding of the synergistic effects of parasitism and virus infections on honeybee population dynamics and its persistence. Interesting findings from our work include: (a) due to Allee effects experienced by the honeybee population, initial conditions are essential for the survival of the colony. (b) Low adult honeybees to brood ratios have destabilizing effects on the system which generate fluctuating dynamics that lead to a catastrophic event where both honeybees and mites suddenly become extinct. This catastrophic event could be potentially linked to Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) of honeybee colonies. (c) Virus infections may have stabilizing effects on the system, and parasitic mites could make disease more persistent. Our model illustrates how the synergy between the parasitic mites and virus infections consequently generates rich dynamics including multiple attractors where all species can coexist or go extinct depending on initial conditions. Our findings may provide important insights on honeybee viruses and parasites and how to best control them. © 2016 Elsevier Inc..

Multiyear survey targeting disease incidence in US honey bees	The US National Honey Bee Disease Survey sampled colony pests and diseases from 2009 to 2014. We verified the absence of Tropilaelaps spp., the Asian honey bee (Apis cerana), and slow bee paralysis virus. Endemic health threats were quantified, including Varroa destructor, Nosema spp., and eight honey bee viruses. Varroa loads varied across years, with annual fall peaks; Nosema peaked January to April. Migratory beekeepers had significantly lower Varroa prevalence (84.9 vs. 97.0 %) and loads (3.65 ± 0.28 vs. 5.99 ± 0.22) than stationary operations, while Nosema was more prevalent (59.9 vs. 46.7 %) in migratory colonies. Since 2010, chronic bee paralysis virus prevalence doubled annually. We detected strong positive relationships between V. destructor and Varroa-transmitted viruses, between Nosema and Lake Sinai virus 2, and a positive relationship across several viral pathogens of bees. The results provide a disease baseline to help identify drivers of poor bee health. © 2016, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		annual review, apiculture, colony, disease incidence, disease prevalence, honeybee, mite, parasite, pest species, spatiotemporal analysis, virus, United States, Apis cerana, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Chronic bee paralysis virus, Nosema, Tropilaelaps, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2016-05-01
Modulation of pesticide response in honeybees	Honeybee exposure to pesticides is widely accepted, but the role they play in impacting bee health remains controversial. The development of risk assessment procedures is notably a difficult task due to the variability of responses observed for a single pesticide at a specific dose. Indeed, honeybees, during most of their lifetime, are exposed to fluctuating environmental conditions (e.g., pathogen pressure, resource availability, climatic conditions) and can go through important physiological changes within a few days (e.g., behavioral maturation) or even a day (e.g., circadian clock), which are all factors that can affect the bee response to pesticides. Integrating the range of variability in conditions experienced by bees is relevant to honeybee toxicology and will contribute to a better assessment of their susceptibility to pesticides. The aim of this review is therefore to provide empirical evidence of how co-exposure to stressors, and environmental and endogenous factors modulate the honeybee response to pesticide. © 2016, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		dose-response relationship, ecotoxicology, environmental factor, health risk, honeybee, pesticide resistance, physiological response, pollution exposure, risk assessment, toxicity test, Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2016-05-01
Population growth of Varroa destructor (Acari: Varroidae) in honey bee colonies is affected by the number of foragers with mites	Varroa mites are a serious pest of honey bees and the leading cause of colony losses. Varroa have relatively low reproductive rates, so populations should not increase rapidly, but often they do. Other factors might contribute to the growth of varroa populations including mite migration into colonies on foragers from other hives. We measured the proportion of foragers carrying mites on their bodies while entering and leaving hives, and determined its relationship to the growth of varroa populations in those hives at two apiary sites. We also compared the estimates of mite population growth with predictions from a varroa population dynamics model that generates estimates of mite population growth based on mite reproduction. Samples of capped brood and adult bees indicated that the proportion of brood cells infested with mites and adult bees with phoretic mites was low through the summer but increased sharply in the fall especially at site 1. The frequency of capturing foragers with mites on their bodies while entering or leaving hives also increased in the fall. The growth of varroa populations at both sites was not significantly related to our colony estimates of successful mite reproduction, but instead to the total number of foragers with mites (entering and leaving the colony). There were more foragers with mites at site 1 than site 2, and mite populations at site 1 were larger especially in the fall. The model accurately estimated phoretic mite populations and infested brood cells until November when predictions were much lower than those measured in colonies. The rapid growth of mite populations particularly in the fall being a product of mite migration rather than mite reproduction only is discussed. © 2016, The Author(s).		brood size, cells and cell components, colony, dispersal, estimation method, growth response, honeybee, host-parasite interaction, migration, mite, pest damage, pest species, population growth, prediction, reproduction, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Varroa, Varroa destructor, Varroidae, animal, apiculture, Arizona, bee, feeding behavior, female, male, parasitology, physiology, population growth, Varroidae, Animals, Arizona, Beekeeping, Bees, Feeding Behavior, Female, Male, Population Growth, Varroidae	2016-05-01
Risk indicators affecting honeybee colony survival in Europe: one year of surveillance	The first pan-European harmonized active epidemiological surveillance program on honeybee colony mortality (EPILOBEE) was set up across 17 European Member States to estimate honeybee colony mortality over winter and during the beekeeping season. In nine Member States, overwinter losses were higher and statistically different from the empirical level of 10 % under which the level of overwinter mortality was considered as acceptable with usual beekeeping conditions. In four other countries, these losses were lower. Using multivariable Poisson regression models, it was showed that the size of the operation and apiary and the clinically detected varroosis, American foulbrood (AFB), and nosemosis before winter significantly affected 2012–2013 overwinter losses. Clinically detected diseases, the size of the operation and apiary, and the non-participation to a common veterinary treatment significantly affected 2013 summer losses. EPILOBEE was a prerequisite to implement future projects studying risk factors affecting colony health such as multiple and co-exposure to pesticides. © 2016, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		apiculture, colony, commercial species, environmental indicator, epidemiology, honeybee, mortality risk, risk factor, seasonal variation, survival, winter, Europe, Apis mellifera	2016-05-01
Optimization of solar irradiated Fenton treatment of pesticide chlorpyrifos wastewater by response surface methodology	The study examined solar irradiation for enhancement of Fenton treatment of pesticide chlorpyrifos wastewater. Optimization of the process was achieved by employing the central composite design (CCD). Total organic removal (TOC) removal of 89.2 % was obtained under the optimized conditions (pH 3, H2O2/COD 2.25 and H2O2/Fe2+ 10 molar ratios and 60 min reaction time). The improvement of biodegradability (BOD5/COD ratio) index from 0 to 0.41 obviously indicated that biological treatment could be applied after pretreatment for complete treatment of the wastewater. The experimental results and model prediction had an error less than 5 % owing to the close data obtained. Solar irradiated Fenton treatment is effective for the pretreatment of pesticide chlorpyrifos wastewater before biological treatment maybe applied. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Honey Bees and Colony Collapse Disorder: A Pluralistic Reframing	Scientific narratives surrounding colony collapse disorder (CCD) are often played against one another. However, oppositional knowledge politics do not neatly segregate the materiality and causal properties of the ecological phenomena they represent. Thus the challenge with CCD is not just to describe the partisan character of how knowledge about it is socially produced. It is also about how to integrate these politics through their less antagonistic material ecologies. We review three dominant discourses underlying CCD and honey bee decline and present a synthesis that conveys how their socially embedded perceptions about ecological causality are more compatible. We invoke a theoretical framework from complexity theory to demonstrate how multiple kinds of ecological causality, from the identifiable and addressable to the more emergent and unpredictable, can align under conflicting policy positions. We argue that this continuum of ecological explanations is a more conciliatory framework for responding to CCD. It provides an alternative to the antagonistic politics that tend to reify and defend either a restrictive search for a singular cause, a paralyzing documentation of all possible permutations of CCD, or a return to a utopian agrarian past. Relating how ecological knowledge is socially produced can illuminate stakeholder positions and strategies. But it is also constructive to map out how the ecological suppositions underlying them relate and inform one under. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.		apiculture, colony, honeybee, pollination, Apis mellifera	2016-05-01
Long lasting summer flowerings of Lythrum salicaria as honeybee-friendly flower spots in Mediterranean basin agricultural wetlands	The purple loosestrife, Lythrum salicaria, is a species native to Eurasia. It is rustic, produces both pollen and nectar, and may be a helpful food source for bees in Mediterranean wetlands, helping them to overcome hot summer periods characterised by food paucity. In this research, we investigated the flowering of L. salicaria plants in Mediterranean agricultural wetlands, as well as pollinator diversity and abundance. L. salicaria has a long lasting flowering, with more than 640 open flowers/plant from mid-July to early September. 476 pollinators belonging to 3 orders, 7 families and 15 species of insects were studied. Scanning electron microscopy showed that all species carried L. salicaria pollen on their body parts. Hymenoptera pollinators were the most abundant (427 specimens), followed by Diptera (26) and Lepidoptera (23). Apoidea abundance reached a maximum in August and social bees largely dominate (94.38%). Apis mellifera was the most abundant species, followed by 5 bumblebees, including the endangered Bombus sylvarum. Honeybee visits on L. salicaria were higher in August over the rest of the summer and early autumn, while no differences were detected for bumblebees, Halictidae and Megachilidae. Overall, we support L. salicaria as a suitable species for bee-friendly flower spots in Mediterranean agricultural wetlands, as well as in close proximity of beehives. The latter use may facilitate the honeybees collecting pollen for the colony, thereby ensuring robustness to overcome the winter season. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.		abundance, colony, flowering, herb, honeybee, nectar, pollen, pollinator, scanning electron microscopy, summer, wetland, Eurasia, Mediterranean Sea, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Bombus sylvarum, Diptera, Halictidae, Hexapoda, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Lysimachia, Lythrum salicaria, Megachilidae	2016-05-01
Cellular immunity in Apis mellifera: studying hemocytes brings light about bees skills to confront threats	Honey bee colonies are threatened by different stress factors around the world. Considerable efforts are being devoted to understanding honey bee defences to confront different kinds of stress factors. Despite the importance of honey bee hemocytes in resisting disease, detailed information about their role in response to challenge is still scarce. This manuscript combines the results obtained in studies which focused on the cellular defences of Apis mellifera, aiming to show how the understanding of the cellular components of the immune system is central to developing new strategies to enhance bees’ fitness. © 2015, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		cells and cell components, fitness, honeybee, immune system, immunity, Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2016-05-01
Quo vadis Aethina tumida? Biology and control of small hive beetles	Small hive beetles (SHBs) are generalists native to sub-Saharan Africa and reproduce in association with honeybees, bumblebees, stingless bees, fruits and meat. The SHB has recently become an invasive species, and introductions have been recorded from America, Australia, Europe and Asia since 1996. While SHBs are usually considered a minor pest in Africa, they can cause significant damage to social bee colonies in their new ranges. Potential reasons for differential impact include differences in bee behaviour, climate and release from natural enemies. Here, we provide an overview on biology, distribution, pest status, diagnosis, control and prevention to foster adequate mitigation and stimulate future research. SHBs have become a global threat to both apiculture and wild bee populations, but our knowledge of this pest is still limited, creating demand for more research in all areas of its biology. © 2016, The Author(s).		apiculture, bee, beetle, biological control, biological method, generalist, home range, invasive species, natural enemy, pest species, spatial distribution, wild population, Asia, Australia, Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, Aethina tumida, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Meliponinae	2016-05-01
Pharmacophagy and pharmacophory: mechanisms of self-medication and disease prevention in the honeybee colony (Apis mellifera)	Apitherapy promises cures for diseases in human folk medicine, but the effects of honeybee produced and foraged compounds on bee health are less known. Yet, hive products should chiefly facilitate medication and sanitation of the honeybees themselves rather than other organisms. We here review the impact of both self-produced gland secretions and foraged hive products (pharmacognosy) on colony health. Although foraged plant-derived compounds vary highly in antibiotic activity depending on the floral and regional origins, secondary plant metabolites in honey, pollen and propolis are important for the antibiotic activity against pathogens and parasites. However, specific bee health-enhancing activities of bee products should clearly be distinguished from the effects of an intact nutrition ensuring the basic immune competence of bees. Further unravelling the interactions among groups of active substances or individual compounds used in concert with specific behavioural adaptations will deepen our understanding of the natural potential of honeybees to maintain colony health. © 2015, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		antibiotics, antimicrobial activity, behavioral response, disease control, honey, honeybee, host-parasite interaction, immune response, pollen, sanitation, secondary metabolite, Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2016-05-01
Sublethal effects of acaricides and Nosema ceranae infection on immune related gene expression in honeybees	Nosema ceranae is an obligate intracellular parasite and the etiologic agent of Nosemosis that affects honeybees. Beside the stress caused by this pathogen, honeybee colonies are exposed to pesticides under beekeeper intervention, such as acaricides to control Varroa mites. These compounds can accumulate at high concentrations in apicultural matrices. In this work, the effects of parasitosis/acaricide on genes involved in honeybee immunity and survival were evaluated. Nurse bees were infected with N. ceranae and/or were chronically treated with sublethal doses of coumaphos or tau-fluvalinate, the two most abundant pesticides recorded in productive hives. Our results demonstrate the following: (1) honeybee survival was not affected by any of the treatments; (2) parasite development was not altered by acaricide treatments; (3) coumaphos exposure decreased lysozyme expression; (4) N. ceranae reduced levels of vitellogenin transcripts independently of the presence of acaricides. However, combined effects among stressors on imagoes were not recorded. Sublethal doses of acaricides and their interaction with other ubiquitous parasites in colonies, extending the experimental time, are of particular interest in further research work. © 2016 Garrido et al.		acaricide, animal, bee, drug effects, gene expression, genetics, immunity, immunology, microbiology, microsporidiosis, Nosema, parasitology, real time polymerase chain reaction, Varroidae, veterinary, Acaricides, Animals, Bees, Gene Expression, Immunity, Microsporidiosis, Nosema, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Varroidae	2016-04-26
The bee microbiome: Impact on bee health and model for evolution and ecology of host-microbe interactions	As pollinators, bees are cornerstones for terrestrial ecosystem stability and key components in agricultural productivity. All animals, including bees, are associated with a diverse community of microbes, commonly referred to as the microbiome. The bee microbiome is likely to be a crucial factor affecting host health. However, with the exception of a few pathogens, the impacts of most members of the bee microbiome on host health are poorly understood. Further, the evolutionary and ecological forces that shape and change the microbiome are unclear. Here, we discuss recent progress in our understanding of the bee microbiome, and we present challenges associated with its investigation. We conclude that global coordination of research efforts is needed to fully understand the complex and highly dynamic nature of the interplay between the bee microbiome, its host, and the environment. High-throughput sequencing technologies are ideal for exploring complex biological systems, including host-microbe interactions. To maximize their value and to improve assessment of the factors affecting bee health, sequence data should be archived, curated, and analyzed in ways that promote the synthesis of different studies. To this end, the BeeBiome consortium aims to develop an online database which would provide reference sequences, archive metadata, and host analytical resources. The goal would be to support applied and fundamental research on bees and their associated microbes and to provide a collaborative framework for sharing primary data from different research programs, thus furthering our understanding of the bee microbiome and its impact on pollinator health. © 2016 Engel et al.

Rising atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> is reducing the protein concentration of a floral pollen source essential for north American bees	At present, there is substantive evidence that the nutritional content of agriculturally important food crops will decrease in response to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, Ca. However, whether Ca-induced declines in nutritional quality are also occurring for pollinator food sources is unknown. Flowering late in the season, goldenrod (Solidago spp.) pollen is a widely available autumnal food source commonly acknowledged by apiarists to be essential to native bee (e.g. Bombus spp.) and honeybee (Apis mellifera) health and winter survival. Using floral collections obtained from the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, we quantified Ca-induced temporal changes in pollen protein concentration of Canada goldenrod (Solidago canadensis), the most widespread Solidago taxon, from hundreds of samples collected throughout the USA and southern Canada over the period 1842-2014 (i.e. a Ca from approx. 280 to 398 ppm). In addition, we conducted a 2 year in situ trial of S. canadensis populations grown along a continuous Ca gradient from approximately 280 to 500 ppm. The historical data indicated a strong significant correlation between recent increases in Ca and reductions in pollen protein concentration (r2 = 0.81). Experimental data confirmed this decrease in pollen protein concentration, and indicated that it would be ongoing as Ca continues to rise in the near term, i.e. to 500 ppm (r2 = 0.88). While additional data are needed to quantify the subsequent effects of reduced protein concentration for Canada goldenrod on bee health and population stability, these results are the first to indicate that increasing Ca can reduce protein content of a floral pollen source widely used by North American bees. © 2016 The Authors.		atmospheric gas, bee, carbon dioxide, concentration (composition), correlation, herb, pollen, pollinator, protein, reduction, survival, Canada, United States, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Solidago, Solidago canadensis, air pollutant, carbon dioxide, air pollutant, analysis, animal, atmosphere, bee, chemistry, climate change, flower, Indiana, Maryland, physiology, pollen, pollination, Solidago, Air Pollutants, Animals, Atmosphere, Bees, Carbon Dioxide, Climate Change, Flowers, Indiana, Maryland, Pollen, Pollination, Solidago	2016-04-13
Chronic neonicotinoid pesticide exposure and parasite stress differentially affects learning in honeybees and bumblebees	Learning and memory are crucial functions which enable insect pollinators to efficiently locate and extract floral rewards. Exposure to pesticides or infection by parasites may cause subtle but ecologically important changes in cognitive functions of pollinators. The potential interactive effects of these stressors on learning and memory have not yet been explored. Furthermore, sensitivity to stressors may differ between species, but few studies have compared responses in different species. Here, we show that chronic exposure to fieldrealistic levels of the neonicotinoid clothianidin impaired olfactory learning acquisition in honeybees, leading to potential impacts on colony fitness, but not in bumblebees. Infection by the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae slightly impaired learning in honeybees, but no interactive effects were observed. Nosema did not infect bumblebees (3% infection success). Nevertheless, Nosema-treated bumblebees had a slightly lower rate of learning than controls, but faster learning in combination with neonicotinoid exposure. This highlights the potential for complex interactive effects of stressors on learning. Our results underline that one cannot readily extrapolate findings from one bee species to others. This has important implications for regulatory risk assessments which generally use honeybees as a model for all bees. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Molecular Effects of Neonicotinoids in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera)	Neonicotinoids are implicated in the decline of bee populations. As agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, they disturb acetylcholine receptor signaling leading to neurotoxicity. Several behavioral studies showed the link between neonicotinoid exposure and adverse effects on foraging activity and reproduction. However, molecular effects underlying these effects are poorly understood. Here we elucidated molecular effects at environmental realistic levels of three neonicotinoids and nicotine, and compared laboratory studies to field exposures with acetamiprid. We assessed transcriptional alterations of eight selected genes in caged honey bees exposed to different concentrations of the neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloporid, and thiamethoxam, as well as nicotine. We determined transcripts of several targets, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α 1 and α 2 subunit, the multifunctional gene vitellogenin, immune system genes apidaecin and defensin-1, stress-related gene catalase and two genes linked to memory formation, pka and creb. Vitellogenin showed a strong increase upon neonicotinoid exposures in the laboratory and field, while creb and pka transcripts were down-regulated. The induction of vitellogenin suggests adverse effects on foraging activity, whereas creb and pka down-regulation may be implicated in decreased long-term memory formation.

Intensively cultivated landscape and varroa mite infestation are associated with reduced honey bee nutritional state	As key pollinators, honey bees are crucial to many natural and agricultural ecosystems. An important factor in the health of honey bees is the availability of diverse floral resources. However, inmany parts of the world, high-intensity agriculture could result in a reduction in honey bee forage. Previous studies have investigated how the landscape surrounding honey bee hives affects some aspects of honey bee health, but to our knowledge there have been no investigations of the effects of intensively cultivated landscapes on indicators of individual bee health such as nutritional physiology and pathogen loads. Furthermore, agricultural landscapes in different regions vary greatly in forage and land management, indicating a need for additional information on the relationship between honey bee health and landscape cultivation. Here, we add to this growing body of information by investigating differences in nutritional physiology between honey bees kept in areas of comparatively low and high cultivation in an area generally high agricultural intensity in the Midwestern United States.We focused on bees collected directly before winter, because overwintering stress poses one of the most serious problems for honey bees in temperate climates.We found that honey bees kept in areas of lower cultivation exhibited higher lipid levels than those kept in areas of high cultivation, but this effect was observed only in colonies that were free of Varroa mites. Furthermore, we found that the presence of mites was associated with lower lipid levels and higher titers of deformed wing virus (DWV), as well as a non-significant trend towards higher overwinter losses. Overall, these results show that mite infestation interacts with landscape, obscuring the effects of landscape alone and suggesting that the benefits of improved foraging landscape could be lost without adequate control of mite infestations. © 2016 Dolezal et al.

Parasaccharibacter apium, gen. Nov., sp. Nov., Improves Honey Bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) resistance to Nosema	The honey bee, Apis mellifera L., is host to a variety of microorganisms. The bacterial community that occupies the adult worker gut contains a core group of approximately seven taxa, while the hive environment contains its own distribution of bacteria that is in many ways distinct from the gut. Parasaccharibacter apium, gen. nov., sp. nov., is a hive bacterium found in food stores and in larvae, worker jelly, worker hypopharyngeal glands, and queens. Parasaccharibacter apium increases larval survival under laboratory conditions. To determine if this benefit is extended to colonies in the field, we tested if P. apium 1) survives and reproduces in supplemental pollen patty, 2) is distributed throughout the hive when added to pollen patty, 3) benefits colony health, and 4) increases the ability of bees to resist Nosema. Parasaccharibacter apium survived in supplemental diet and was readily consumed by bees. It was distributed throughout the hive under field conditions, moving from the pollen patty to hive larvae. While P. apium did not significantly increase colony brood production, food stores, or foraging rates, it did increase resistance to Nosema infection. Our data suggest that P. apium may positively impact honey bee health. © 2016 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America 2016.

Effects of pollen dilution on infection of Nosema ceranae in honey bees	Multiple stressors are currently threatening honey bee health, including pests and pathogens. Among honey bee pathogens, Nosema ceranae is a microsporidian found parasitizing the western honey bee (Apis mellifera) relatively recently. Honey bee colonies are fed pollen or protein substitute during pollen dearth to boost colony growth and immunity against pests and pathogens. Here we hypothesize that N. ceranae intensity and prevalence will be low in bees receiving high pollen diets, and that honey bees on high pollen diets will have higher survival and/or increased longevity. To test this hypothesis we examined the effects of different quantities of pollen on (a) the intensity and prevalence of N. ceranae and (b) longevity and nutritional physiology of bees inoculated with N. ceranae. Significantly higher spore intensities were observed in treatments that received higher pollen quantities (1:0 and 1:1 pollen:cellulose) when compared to treatments that received relatively lower pollen quantities. There were no significant differences in N. ceranae prevalence among different pollen diet treatments. Interestingly, the bees in higher pollen quantity treatments also had significantly higher survival despite higher intensities of N. ceranae. Significantly higher hypopharyngeal gland protein was observed in the control (no Nosema infection, and receiving a diet of 1:0 pollen:cellulose), followed by 1:0 pollen:cellulose treatment that was inoculated with N. ceranae. Here we demonstrate that diet with higher pollen quantity increases N. ceranae intensity, but also enhances the survival or longevity of honey bees. The information from this study could potentially help beekeepers formulate appropriate protein feeding regimens for their colonies to mitigate N. ceranae problems. © 2016 The Authors.		diet, disease prevalence, disease treatment, fungus, honeybee, infectivity, longevity, nutritional requirement, physiological response, pollen, spore, survival, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Nosema, Nosema ceranae, animal, bee, feeding behavior, microbiology, Nosema, physiology, pollen, Animals, Bees, Feeding Behavior, Nosema, Pollen	2016-04-01
A WSN-based automatic monitoring system for the foraging behavior of honey bees and environmental factors of beehives	The activity of a honey bee colony is heavily environmentally dependent. So, monitoring the colony activity should include the information of biological and physical factors both inside and outside of a beehive. However, using manual methods to simultaneously monitor the incoming and outgoing activities of a large amount of foragers and the environmental factors with high temporal resolution may cause drawbacks such as labor intensive and low accuracy. To cope with these difficulties, this study develops an automatic monitoring system for honey bee behavior based on wireless sensor network (WSN) technology. The monitoring system can be installed at the entrance of a beehive. The WSN-based monitoring system can not only detect the environmental factors both inside and outside the beehive, but also provide the long-term data of incoming and outgoing foraging activities of honey bees with a high temporal resolution. The results show that the average counting accuracy of incoming and outgoing behavior is 84.92% and 85.95%, respectively. Moreover, the long-term monitoring data that represent the frequencies of incoming and outgoing activities and the beehive related environmental factors are also analyzed. According to the data, honey bees become more energetic when the daily average ambient temperature is higher than 25 °C, and the average ambient relative humidity is between 60%RH and 70%RH. The experimental results show that the proposed monitoring system can reliably collect environmental data and the data related to the activities of honey bees simultaneously. This study also demonstrates that the proposed monitoring system is an excellent platform, which can be used to examine the relation between honey bees' incoming and outgoing activities and environmental factors. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..

Factors influencing the prevalence and infestation levels of Varroa destructor in honeybee colonies in two highland agro-ecological zones of Uganda	Varroa mites are ecto-parasites of honeybees and are a threat to the beekeeping industry. We identified the haplotype of Varroa mites and evaluated potential factors that influence their prevalence and infestation levels in the eastern and western highland agro-ecological zones of Uganda. This was done by collecting samples of adult worker bees between December 2014 and September 2015 in two sampling moments. Samples of bees were screened for Varroa using the ethanol wash method and the mites were identified by molecular techniques. All DNA sequences obtained from sampled mite populations in the two zones were 100 % identical to the Korean Haplotype (AF106899). Mean mite prevalence in the apiaries was 40 and 53 % for the western and eastern zones, respectively, during the first sampling. Over the second sampling, mean mite prevalence increased considerably in the western (59 %) but not in the eastern (51 %) zone. Factors that were associated with Varroa mite infestation levels include altitude, nature of apiary slope and apiary management practices during the first sampling. Our results further showed that Varroa mites were spreading from lower to higher elevations. Feral colonies were also infested with Varroa mites at infestation levels not significantly different from those in managed colonies. Colony productivity and strength were not correlated to mite infestation levels. We recommend a long-term Varroa mite monitoring strategy in areas of varying landscape and land use factors for a clear understanding of possible changes in mite infestation levels among African honeybees for informed decision making. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.		apiculture, colony, decision making, ecozone, ectoparasite, honeybee, land use, landscape, management practice, mite, parasite infestation, parasite prevalence, upland region, Korea, Uganda, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apis mellifera scutellata, Apoidea, Varroa, Varroa destructor, animal, apiculture, bee, parasitology, physiology, prevalence, Uganda, Varroidae, Animals, Beekeeping, Bees, Prevalence, Uganda, Varroidae	2016-04-01
Survey and risk assessment of apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) exposure to neonicotinoid pesticides in Urban, Rural, and agricultural settings	A comparative assessment of apiaries in urban, rural, and agricultural areas was undertaken in 2013 and 2014 to examine potential honey bee colony exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides from pollen foraging. Apiaries ranged in size from one to hundreds of honey bee colonies, and included those operated by commercial, sideline (semicommercial), and hobbyist beekeepers. Residues in and on wax and beebread (stored pollen in the hive) were evaluated for the nitro-substituted neonicotinoid insecticides imidacloprid and its olefin metabolite and the active ingredients clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and dinotefuran. Beebread and comb wax collected from hives in agricultural landscapes were more likely to have detectable residues of thiamethoxam and clothianidin than that collected from hives in rural or urban areas (∼50% of samples vs. <10%). The maximum neonicotinoid residue detected in either wax or beebread was 3.9 ppb imidacloprid. A probabilistic risk assessment was conducted on the residues recovered from beebread in apiaries located in commercial, urban, and rural landscapes. The calculated risk quotient based on a dietary no observable adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) suggested low potential for negative effects on bee behavior or colony health. © The Authors 2016.

Starvation stress during larval development facilitates an adaptive response in adult worker honey bees (Apis mellifera L.)	Most organisms are constantly faced with environmental changes and stressors. In diverse organisms, there is an anticipatory mechanism during development that can program adult phenotypes. The adult phenotype would be adapted to the predicted environment that occurred during organism maturation. However, whether this anticipatory mechanism is present in eusocial species is questionable because eusocial organisms are largely shielded from exogenous conditions by their stable nest environment. In this study, we tested whether food deprivation during development of the honey bee (Apis mellifera), a eusocial insect model, can shift adult phenotypes to better cope with nutritional stress. After subjecting fifth instar worker larvae to short-term starvation, we measured nutrition-related morphology, starvation resistance, physiology, endocrinology and behavior in the adults. We found that the larval starvation caused adult honey bees to become more resilient toward starvation. Moreover, the adult bees were characterized by reduced ovary size, elevated glycogen stores and juvenile hormone (JH) titers, and decreased sugar sensitivity. These changes, in general, can help adult insects survive and reproduce in food-poor environments. Overall, we found for the first time support for an anticipatory mechanism in a eusocial species, the honey bee. Our results suggest that this mechanism may play a role in honey bee queen-worker differentiation and worker division of labor, both of which are related to the responses to nutritional stress. © 2016.

Do managed bees drive parasite spread and emergence in wild bees?	Bees have been managed and utilised for honey production for centuries and, more recently, pollination services. Since the mid 20th Century, the use and production of managed bees has intensified with hundreds of thousands of hives being moved across countries and around the globe on an annual basis. However, the introduction of unnaturally high densities of bees to areas could have adverse effects. Importation and deployment of managed honey bee and bumblebees may be responsible for parasite introductions or a change in the dynamics of native parasites that ultimately increases disease prevalence in wild bees. Here we review the domestication and deployment of managed bees and explain the evidence for the role of managed bees in causing adverse effects on the health of wild bees. Correlations with the use of managed bees and decreases in wild bee health from territories across the globe are discussed along with suggestions to mitigate further health reductions in wild bees. © 2015 The Authors.			2016-04-01
Ecology of Varroa destructor, the Major Ectoparasite of the Western Honey Bee, Apis mellifera	Varroa destructor is the most important ectoparasite of Apis mellifera. This review addresses the interactions between the varroa mite, its environment, and the honey bee host, mediated by an impressive number of cues and signals, including semiochemicals regulating crucial steps of the mite's life cycle. Although mechanical stimuli, temperature, and humidity play an important role, chemical communication is the most important channel. Kairomones are used at all stages of the mite's life cycle, and the exploitation of bees' brood pheromones is particularly significant given these compounds function as primer and releaser signals that regulate the social organization of the honey bee colony. V. destructor is a major problem for apiculture, and the search for novel control methods is an essential task for researchers. A detailed study of the ecological interactions of V. destructor is a prerequisite for creating strategies to sustainably manage the parasite. © Copyright 2016 by Annual Reviews.

Effects of Nosema apis, N. ceranae, and coinfections on honey bee (Apis mellifera) learning and memory	Western honey bees (Apis mellifera) face an increasing number of challenges that in recent years have led to significant economic effects on apiculture, with attendant consequences for agriculture. Nosemosis is a fungal infection of honey bees caused by either Nosema apis or N. ceranae. The putative greater virulence of N. ceranae has spurred interest in understanding how it differs from N. apis. Little is known of effects of N. apis or N. ceranae on honey bee learning and memory. Following a Pavlovian model that relies on the proboscis extension reflex, we compared acquisition learning and long-term memory recall of uninfected (control) honey bees versus those inoculated with N. apis, N. ceranae, or both. We also tested whether spore intensity was associated with variation in learning and memory. Neither learning nor memory differed among treatments. There was no evidence of a relationship between spore intensity and learning, and only limited evidence of a negative effect on memory; this occurred only in the co-inoculation treatment. Our results suggest that if Nosema spp. are contributing to unusually high colony losses in recent years, the mechanism by which they may affect honey bees is probably not related to effects on learning or memory, at least as assessed by the proboscis extension reflex.		animal, bee, long term memory, microbiology, microsporidiosis, mixed infection, Nosema, pathogenicity, pathophysiology, physiology, reflex, Animals, Bees, Coinfection, Memory, Long-Term, Microsporidiosis, Nosema, Reflex	2016-03-10
Rapid determination of residues of pesticides in honey by µGC-ECD and GC-MS/MS: Method validation and estimation of measurement uncertainty according to document No. SANCO/12571/2013	A simple and straightforward method for simultaneous determination of residues of 13 pesticides in honey samples (acrinathrin, bifenthrin, bromopropylate, cyhalothrin-lambda, cypermethrin, chlorfenvinphos, chlorpyrifos, coumaphos, deltamethrin, fluvalinate-tau, malathion, permethrin and tetradifon) from different pesticide classes has been developed and validated. The analytical method provides dissolution of honey in water and an extraction of pesticide residues by n-Hexane followed by clean-up on a Florisil SPE column. The extract was evaporated and taken up by a solution of an injection internal standard (I-IS), ethion, and finally analyzed by capillary gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-µECD). Identification for qualitative purpose was conducted by gas chromatography with triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (GC-MS/MS). A matrix-matched calibration curve was performed for quantitative purposes by plotting the area ratio (analyte/I-IS) against concentration using a GC-µECD instrument. According to document No. SANCO/12571/2013, the method was validated by testing the following parameters: linearity, matrix effect, specificity, precision, trueness (bias) and measurement uncertainty. The analytical process was validated analyzing blank honey samples spiked at levels equal to and greater than 0.010 mg/kg (limit of quantification). All parameters were satisfactorily compared with the values established by document No. SANCO/12571/2013. The analytical performance was verified by participating in eight multi-residue proficiency tests organized by BIPEA, obtaining satisfactory z-scores in all 70 determinations. Measurement uncertainty was estimated according to the top-down approaches described in Appendix C of the SANCO document using the within-laboratory reproducibility relative standard deviation combined with laboratory bias using the proficiency test data. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Linking measures of colony and individual honey bee health to survival among apiaries exposed to varying agricultural land use	We previously characterized and quantified the influence of land use on survival and productivity of colonies positioned in six apiaries and found that colonies in apiaries surrounded by more land in uncultivated forage experienced greater annual survival, and generally more honey production. Here, detailed metrics of honey bee health were assessed over three years in colonies positioned in the same six apiaries. The colonies were located in North Dakota during the summer months and were transported to California for almond pollination every winter. Our aim was to identify relationships among measures of colony and individual bee health that impacted and predicted overwintering survival of colonies. We tested the hypothesis that colonies in apiaries surrounded by more favorable land use conditions would experience improved health. We modeled colony and individual bee health indices at a critical time point (autumn, prior to overwintering) and related them to eventual spring survival for California almond pollination. Colony measures that predicted overwintering apiary survival included the amount of pollen collected, brood production, and Varroa destructor mite levels. At the individual bee level, expression of vitellogenin, defensin1, and lysozyme2 were important markers of overwinter survival. This study is a novel first step toward identifying pertinent physiological responses in honey bees that result from their positioning near varying landscape features in intensive agricultural environments.		agricultural land, apiary, Article, defensin1 gene, environmental exposure, gene, gene expression, health status, honeybee, lysozyme2 gene, nonhuman, organism colony, overwintering, pollen, species habitat, survival, Varroa destructor, vitellogenin gene, animal, animal husbandry, bee, biological model, North Dakota, physiology, season, Animal Husbandry, Animals, Bees, Models, Biological, North Dakota, Seasons	2016-03-01
The neonicotinoids thiacloprid, imidacloprid, and clothianidin affect the immunocompetence of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.)	A strong immune defense is vital for honey bee health and colony survival. This defense can be weakened by environmental factors that may render honey bees more vulnerable to parasites and pathogens. Honey bees are frequently exposed to neonicotinoid pesticides, which are being discussed as one of the stress factors that may lead to colony failure. We investigated the sublethal effects of the neonicotinoids thiacloprid, imidacloprid, and clothianidin on individual immunity, by studying three major aspects of immunocompetence in worker bees: total hemocyte number, encapsulation response, and antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph. In laboratory experiments, we found a strong impact of all three neonicotinoids. Thiacloprid (24 h oral exposure, 200 μg/l or 2000. μg/l) and imidacloprid (1 μg/l or 10 μg/l) reduced hemocyte density, encapsulation response, and antimicrobial activity even at field realistic concentrations. Clothianidin had an effect on these immune parameters only at higher than field realistic concentrations (50-200 μg/l). These results suggest that neonicotinoids affect the individual immunocompetence of honey bees, possibly leading to an impaired disease resistance capacity. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.		antimicrobial activity, clothianidin, encapsulation, honeybee, imidacloprid, immune system, immunity, immunocompetence, sublethal effect, thiacloprid, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, ((E)-1-(2-chloro-1,3-thiazol-5-ylmethyl)-3-methyl-2-nitroguanidine), guanidine derivative, imidacloprid, imidazole derivative, nitro derivative, pyridine derivative, thiacloprid, thiazine derivative, thiazole derivative, animal, bee, blood cell, drug effects, hemolymph, immunocompetence, immunology, Animals, Bees, Guanidines, Hemocytes, Hemolymph, Imidazoles, Immunocompetence, Nitro Compounds, Pyridines, Thiazines, Thiazoles	2016-03-01
Divergent forms of endoplasmic reticulum stress trigger a robust unfolded protein response in honey bees	Honey bee colonies in the United States have suffered from an increased rate of die-off in recent years, stemming from a complex set of interacting stresses that remain poorly described. While we have some understanding of the physiological stress responses in the honey bee, our molecular understanding of honey bee cellular stress responses is incomplete. Thus, we sought to identify and began functional characterization of the components of the UPR in honey bees. The IRE1-dependent splicing of the mRNA for the transcription factor Xbp1, leading to translation of an isoform with more transactivation potential, represents the most conserved of the UPR pathways. Honey bees and other Apoidea possess unique features in the Xbp1 mRNA splice site, which we reasoned could have functional consequences for the IRE1 pathway. However, we find robust induction of target genes upon UPR stimulation. In addition, the IRE1 pathway activation, as assessed by splicing of Xbp1 mRNA upon UPR, is conserved. By providing foundational knowledge about the UPR in the honey bee and the relative sensitivity of this species to divergent stresses, this work stands to improve our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of honey bee health and disease. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.		colony, honeybee, membrane, molecular analysis, physiological response, protein, RNA, United States, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, insect protein, RNA splice site, tunicamycin, animal, bee, endoplasmic reticulum stress, metabolism, oxidative stress, RNA splice site, unfolded protein response, Animals, Bees, Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress, Insect Proteins, Oxidative Stress, RNA Splice Sites, Tunicamycin, Unfolded Protein Response	2016-03-01
Per-visit pollinator performance and regional importance of wild Bombus and Andrena (Melandrena) compared to the managed honey bee in New York apple orchards	Declines in honey bee health and increasing demand for pollination services highlight a need to optimize crop pollination by wild bees. Apple is an economically important crop in eastern North America, requires insect pollination, and is visited by a diverse bee fauna, but a direct assessment of wild bee pollination in apple orchards is lacking. We combined measurements of two facets of pollination service, per-visit efficiency (fruit and seed set) and relative abundance, to estimate orchard-level, pollinator importance of mining bees (Andrena subgenus Melandrena), bumble bees (Bombus), and honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). Average pollinator importance provided a relative measure that allowed comparison of pollination service among the three focal bees across the study region. On average, a wild bee visit resulted in higher pollen transfer to stigmas, but had the same probability of setting fruit and seed as a honey bee visit. Regionally, pollinator importance of Melandrena and Bombus were 32 and 14 % that of honey bees, respectively. Because per-visit performances were similar, such disparities in importance were based largely on differences in relative abundance. Although the summed pollinator importance of Melandrena and Bombus was less than that of the honey bee, these, and other, wild pollinators have a role to play in filling future pollination gaps, and thus, warrant further study and conservation. © 2015, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		fruit, honeybee, orchard, plant-pollinator interaction, pollen, pollination, pollinator, probability, reproductive success, New York [United States], United States, Apidae, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hexapoda, Malus x domestica, Melandrena	2016-03-01
Differential attractiveness of sunflower cultivars to the honeybee Apis mellifera L.	In France, sunflower honey production has decreased since the nineties and professional beekeepers report important honey yield variability between years and locations. Consequently, melliferous potential of current sunflower cultivars is questioned as it is not part of traits held in breeding programs. To investigate this question, a 3-years study was conducted on two sites and attractiveness for honeybees of 13 current sunflower cultivars was assessed under natural conditions. The number of honeybee visits per plant was recorded daily during blooming period on cultivars randomly distributed on experimental plots. Sunflower genetic was a major factor influencing honeybee attendance on plots and discrepancy between most and least visited cultivars reached a factor of 3. Cultivars relative attractiveness was consistent between years and sites. Potential link between sunflower attractiveness for honeybees and its melliferous characteristics is discussed. If confirmed, farmers' choice concerning cultivars at a territory scale could contribute to enhance nectar resource for pollinators and to increase viability of apicultural activity. © 2016 N.

Screening of environmental contaminants in honey bee wax comb using gas chromatography–high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry	This study reports an analytical approach intended to be used for investigation of non-targeted environmental contaminants and to characterize the organic pollution pattern of bee wax comb samples. The method comprises a generic extraction followed by detection with gas chromatography coupled to high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC–TOF-MS), operated in electron impact ionization (EI) mode. The screening approach for the investigation of non-targeted contaminants consisted of initial peak detection by deconvolution and matching the first-stage mass spectra EI-MS(1) with a nominal mass spectral library. To gain further confidence in the structural characterization of the contaminants under investigation, the molecular formula of representative ions (molecular ion when present in the EI spectrum) and, for at least other two fragment ions, was provided for those with an accurate mass scoring (mass error < 5 ppm). This methodology was applied for screening environmental contaminants in 50 samples of bee wax comb. This approach has allowed the tentative identification of some GC-amenable contaminants belonging to different chemical groups, among them, phthalates and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), along with residues of veterinary treatments used in apiculture. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.		apiculture, bee, deconvolution, environmental assessment, extraction method, gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, methodology, organic pollutant, PAH, phthalate, wax, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, analysis, animal, bee, honey, mass fragmentography, pollution, procedures, Animals, Bees, Environmental Pollution, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, Honey, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons	2016-03-01
Pathogen prevalence and abundance in honey bee colonies involved in almond pollination	Honey bees are important pollinators of agricultural crops. Since 2006, US beekeepers have experienced high annual honey bee colony losses, which may be attributed to multiple abiotic and biotic factors, including pathogens. However, the relative importance of these factors has not been fully elucidated. To identify the most prevalent pathogens and investigate the relationship between colony strength and health, we assessed pathogen occurrence, prevalence, and abundance in Western US honey bee colonies involved in almond pollination. The most prevalent pathogens were Black queen cell virus (BQCV), Lake Sinai virus 2 (LSV2), Sacbrood virus (SBV), Nosema ceranae, and trypanosomatids. Our results indicated that pathogen prevalence and abundance were associated with both sampling date and beekeeping operation, that prevalence was highest in honey bee samples obtained immediately after almond pollination, and that weak colonies had a greater mean pathogen prevalence than strong colonies. © 2015, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		abundance, apiculture, colonial organism, colonization, deciduous tree, disease prevalence, honeybee, host-pathogen interaction, nut, parasite prevalence, pest damage, pollination, viral disease, United States, Apis mellifera, Black queen cell virus, Nosema ceranae, Prunus dulcis, Sacbrood virus, Trypanosomatidae	2016-03-01
A fluorescent method for visualization of Nosema infection in whole-mount honey bee tissues	Honey bees are critical pollinators in both agricultural and ecological settings. The Nosema species, ceranae and apis, are microsporidian parasites that are pathogenic to honey bees. While current methods for detecting Nosema infection have key merits, additional techniques with novel properties for studying the cell biology of Nosema infection are highly desirable. We demonstrate that whole-mount staining of honey bee midgut tissue with chitin-binding agent Fluorescent Brightener 28 and DNA dye Propidium Iodide allows for observation of Nosema infection in structurally intact tissue, providing a new tool for increasing our understanding of Nosema infection at the cellular and tissue level. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.		benzenesulfonic acid derivative, C.I.

Improvement of bait sprays for the control of Bactrocera oleae (Diptera: Tephritidae)	The control of the olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae (Gmelin) is based on insecticides that are usually applied as bait sprays. Large-scale field experiments were conducted in the Kolymvari region of Crete (Greece) to evaluate the efficacy of several bait spray solutions against the fly that were applied at the recommended spraying volume per hectare (or 300 ml per treated tree), compared applications at volumes reduced by two and three fold (150 and 100 ml, respectively). The trophical attractant (hydrolysed protein at 75% w/w) that was used was mixed with alpha-cypermethrin, thiacloprid, thiacloprid + deltamethrin or dimethoate, and these formulations were tested during three successive summers (2012-2014) according to European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO) standards. The products were alternated with one another over time in the experimental plots. The results indicated that all of the bait spraying solutions of the tested products were effective against B. oleae at all of the doses tested and resulted in significantly lower olive fly populations compared with the standard recommended dose, which was indicated by the fly catches in the nets of McPhail traps within the experimental plots. The percentages of live infestations of B. oleae were very low (<2%, except in 2013 due to a very low olive fruit yield), as was the number of applications each year, which was 6-7 and did not differ among treatments. The benefits of this concept in the management of the pest and potential future improvements of the method are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.		bait, crop pest, fly, insecticide, pesticide application, Aegean Islands, Crete [Greece], Greece, Bactrocera oleae, Diptera, Tephritidae	2016-03-01
The fungicide Pristine® inhibits mitochondrial function in vitro but not flight metabolic rates in honey bees	Honey bees and other pollinators are exposed to fungicides that act by inhibiting fungal mitochondria. Here we test whether a common fungicide (Pristine®) inhibits the function of mitochondria of honeybees, and whether consumption of ecologically-realistic concentrations can cause negative effects on the mitochondria of flight muscles, or the capability for flight, as judged by CO2 emission rates and thorax temperatures during flight. Direct exposure of mitochondria to Pristine® levels above 5ppm strongly inhibited mitochondrial oxidation rates in vitro. However, bees that consumed pollen containing Pristine® at ecologically-realistic concentrations (≈1ppm) had normal flight CO2 emission rates and thorax temperatures. Mitochondria isolated from the flight muscles of the Pristine®-consuming bees had higher state 3 oxygen consumption rates than control bees, suggesting that possibly Pristine®-consumption caused compensatory changes in mitochondria. It is likely that the lack of a strong functional effect of Pristine®-consumption on flight performance and the in vitro function of flight muscle mitochondria results from maintenance of Pristine® levels in the flight muscles at much lower levels than occur in the food, probably due to metabolism and detoxification. As Pristine® has been shown to negatively affect feeding rates and protein digestion of honey bees, it is plausible that Pristine® consumption negatively affects gut wall function (where mitochondria may be exposed to higher concentrations of Pristine®). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.		concentration (composition), experimental study, flight behavior, fungicide, honeybee, mitochondrion, oxidation, physiological response, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, biphenyl derivative, carbamic acid derivative, nicotinamide, Pristine (fungicide), pyrazole derivative, age, analogs and derivatives, animal, bee, body temperature, cell respiration, drug effects, female, flying, mitochondrion, Age Factors, Animals, Bees, Biphenyl Compounds, Body Temperature, Carbamates, Cell Respiration, Female, Flight, Animal, Mitochondria, Niacinamide, Pyrazoles	2016-03-01
Honey bee colonies provided with natural forage have lower pathogen loads and higher overwinter survival than those fed protein supplements	Malnutrition is a major cause of colony losses. In managed hives, bees are fed protein supplements (PS) during pollen shortages. If bees were provided with natural forage instead of PS, would they have lower pathogen levels and higher queen and colony survival? We addressed this question by either providing colonies with forage (Brassica rapa—rapini) or feeding them PS from November to February. Soluble protein concentrations in the PS were lower than the rapini pollen as were levels of most amino acids. Nurse bees digested less of the protein in PS than the pollen. Hemolymph protein titers in nurse bees and colony growth did not differ between those fed PS or foraging on rapini. However, colonies fed PS had higher levels of black queen cell virus and Nosema and greater queen losses, indicating that natural forage might improve overwintering survival. © 2015, The Author(s).		amino acid, apiculture, digestion, food supplementation, forage, honeybee, leafy vegetable, malnutrition, overwintering, pathogen, pollen, protein, survival, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Black queen cell virus, Brassica, Nosema	2016-03-01
Effects of pesticide treatments on nutrient levels in worker honey bees (Apis mellifera)	Honey bee colony loss continues to be an issue and no factor has been singled out as to the cause. In this study, we sought to determine whether two beekeeper-applied pesticide products, tau-fluvalinate and Fumagilin-B®, and one agrochemical, chlorothalonil, impact the nutrient levels in honey bee workers in a natural colony environment. Treatments were performed in-hive and at three different periods (fall, spring, and summer) over the course of one year. Bees were sampled both at pre-treatment and two and four weeks post-treatment, weighed, and their protein and carbohydrate levels were determined using BCA and anthrone based biochemical assays, respectively. We report that, based on the pesticide concentrations tested, no significant negative impact of the pesticide products was observed on wet weight, protein levels, or carbohydrate levels of bees from treated colonies compared with bees from untreated control colonies. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.			2016-03-01
Widespread contamination of wildflower and bee-collected pollen with complex mixtures of neonicotinoids and fungicides commonly applied to crops	There is considerable and ongoing debate as to the harm inflicted on bees by exposure to agricultural pesticides. In part, the lack of consensus reflects a shortage of information on field-realistic levels of exposure. Here, we quantify concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticides and fungicides in the pollen of oilseed rape, and in pollen of wildflowers growing near arable fields. We then compare this to concentrations of these pesticides found in pollen collected by honey bees and in pollen and adult bees sampled from bumble bee colonies placed on arable farms. We also compared this with levels found in bumble bee colonies placed in urban areas. Pollen of oilseed rape was heavily contaminated with a broad range of pesticides, as was the pollen of wildflowers growing nearby. Consequently, pollen collected by both bee species also contained a wide range of pesticides, notably including the fungicides carbendazim, boscalid, flusilazole, metconazole, tebuconazole and trifloxystrobin and the neonicotinoids thiamethoxam, thiacloprid and imidacloprid. In bumble bees, the fungicides carbendazim, boscalid, tebuconazole, flusilazole and metconazole were present at concentrations up to 73. nanogram/gram (ng/g). It is notable that pollen collected by bumble bees in rural areas contained high levels of the neonicotinoids thiamethoxam (mean 18. ng/g) and thiacloprid (mean 2.9. ng/g), along with a range of fungicides, some of which are known to act synergistically with neonicotinoids. Pesticide exposure of bumble bee colonies in urban areas was much lower than in rural areas. Understanding the effects of simultaneous exposure of bees to complex mixtures of pesticides remains a major challenge. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Plasticity in the gut microbial community and uptake of Enterobacteriaceae (Gammaproteobacteria) in Bombus terrestris bumblebees’ nests when reared indoors and moved to an outdoor environment	Bombus nests consisting of one queen, brood, and worker adults, are produced indoors for biological pollination in agriculture. In this study, we investigated the gut microbial community in workers of Bombus terrestris when the environment is stable (indoors) or variable (outdoors). When nests were reared indoors under standardized conditions, we identified a small gut microbial community consisting of Neisseriaceae, Orbaceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Bifidobacteriaceae, and the age of bumblebee nests and workers did not affect the alpha and beta diversity, confirming a stable microbiota. Secondly, when indoor-reared nests were moved to outdoors, we observed a major shift in the microbial community, especially in the newborn workers fully developed in the outdoor conditions, with a significant colonization of Enterobacteriaceae. Our new findings are discussed in relation to host-associated core and non-core bacteria in bumblebees including possible implications for host functioning. © 2015, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.

Prochloraz and coumaphos induce different gene expression patterns in three developmental stages of the Carniolan honey bee (Apis mellifera carnica Pollmann)	The Carniolan honey bee, Apis mellifera carnica, is a Slovenian autochthonous subspecies of honey bee. In recent years, the country has recorded an annual loss of bee colonies throughmortality of up to 35%. One possible reason for such highmortality could be the exposure of honey bees to xenobiotic residues that have been found in honey bee and beehive products. Acaricides are applied by beekeepers to control varroosis, while the most abundant common agricultural chemicals found in honey bee and beehive products are fungicides, which may enter the system when applied to nearby flowering crops and fruit plants. Acaricides and fungicides are not intrinsically highly toxic to bees but their action in combination might lead to higher honey bee sensitivity or mortality. In the present studywe investigated the molecular immune response of honey beeworkers at different developmental stages (prepupa, white-eyed pupa, adult) exposed to the acaricide coumaphos and the fungicide prochloraz individually and in combination. Expression of 17 immune-related genes was examined by quantitative RT-PCR. In treated prepupae downregulation of most immune-related geneswas observed in all treatments, while in adults upregulation of most of the genes was recorded. Our study shows for the first time that negative impacts of prochloraz and a combination of coumaphos and prochloraz differ among the different developmental stages of honey bees. The main effect of the xenobiotic combination was found to be upregulation of the antimicrobial peptide genes abaecin and defensin-1 in adult honey bees. Changes in immune-related gene expression could result in depressed immunity of honey bees and their increased susceptibility to various pathogens. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.		coumafos, fungicide, imidazole derivative, prochloraz, animal, bee, drug effects, gene expression, growth, development and aging, Animals, Bees, Coumaphos, Fungicides, Industrial, Gene Expression, Imidazoles	2016-03-01
In vivo study of Dicer-2-mediated immune response of the small interfering RNA pathway upon systemic infections of virulent and avirulent viruses in Bombus terrestris	Recent studies suggest a potent role of the small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway in the control of bee viruses and its usefulness to tackle these viral diseases. However, the involvement of the siRNA pathway in the defense against different bee viruses is still poorly understood. Therefore, in this report, we comprehensively analyzed the response of the siRNA pathway in bumblebees of Bombus terrestris to systemic infections of the virulent Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) and the avirulent slow bee paralysis virus (SBPV). Our results showed that IAPV and SBPV infections induced the expression of Dicer-2. IAPV infections also triggered the production of predominantly 22 nt-long virus-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs). Intriguingly, these 22 nt-long vsiRNAs showed a high proportion of antigenomic IAPV sequences. Conversely, these predominantly 22 nt-long vsiRNAs of SBPV were not detected in SBPV infected bees. Furthermore, an "RNAi-of-RNAi" experiment on Dicer-2 did not result in altered genome copy numbers of IAPV (n = 17-18) and also not of SBPV (n = 11-12). Based on these results, we can speculate about the importance of the siRNA pathway in bumblebees for the antiviral response. During infection of IAPV, this pathway is probably recruited but it might be insufficient to control viral infection in our experimental setup. The host can control SBPV infection, but aside from the induction of Dicer-2 expression, no further evidence of the antiviral activity of the siRNA pathway was observed. This report may also enhance the current understanding of the siRNA pathway in the innate immunity of non-model insects upon different viral infections. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Multi-residue method for the determination of pesticides and pesticide metabolites in honeybees by liquid and gas chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry—Honeybee poisoning incidents	A method for the determination of 200 pesticides and pesticide metabolites in honeybee samples has been developed and validated. Almost 98% of compounds included in this method are approved to use within European Union, as active substances of plant protection products or veterinary medicinal products used by beekeepers to control mites Varroa destructor in hives. Many significant metabolites, like metabolites of imidacloprid, thiacloprid, fipronil, methiocarb and amitraz, are also possible to detect. The sample preparation was based on the buffered QuEChERS method. Samples of bees were extracted with acetonitrile containing 1% acetic acid and then subjected to clean-up by dispersive solid phase extraction (dSPE) using a new Z-Sep+ sorbent and PSA. The majority of pesticides, including neonicotionoids and their metabolites, were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) but some of pesticides, especially pyrethroid insecticides, were analyzed by gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC–MS/MS). The procedure was validated according to the Guidance document SANCO/12571/2013 at four concentration levels: 1, 5, 10 and 100 ng/g bees and verified in the international proficiency test. The analysis of bee samples spiked at the limit of quantification (LOQ) showed about 98% mean recovery value (trueness) and 97% of analytes showed recovery in the required range of 70–120% and RSDr (precision) below 20%. Linearity and matrix effects were also established. The LOQs of pesticides were in the range of 1–100 ng/g. The developed method allows determination of insecticides at concentrations of 10 ng/g or less, except abamectin and tebufenozide. LOQ values are lower than the median lethal doses LD50 for bees. The method was used to investigate more than 70 honeybee poisoning incidents. Data about detected pesticides and their metabolites are included. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Toward an Upgraded Honey Bee (Apis mellifera L.) Genome Annotation Using Proteogenomics	The honey bee is a key pollinator in agricultural operations as well as a model organism for studying the genetics and evolution of social behavior. The Apis mellifera genome has been sequenced and annotated twice over, enabling proteomics and functional genomics methods for probing relevant aspects of their biology. One troubling trend that emerged from proteomic analyses is that honey bee peptide samples consistently result in lower peptide identification rates compared with other organisms. This suggests that the genome annotation can be improved, or atypical biological processes are interfering with the mass spectrometry workflow. First, we tested whether high levels of polymorphisms could explain some of the missed identifications by searching spectra against the reference proteome (OGSv3.2) versus a customized proteome of a single honey bee, but our results indicate that this contribution was minor. Likewise, error-tolerant peptide searches lead us to eliminate unexpected post-translational modifications as a major factor in missed identifications. We then used a proteogenomic approach with ∼1500 raw files to search for missing genes and new exons, to revive discarded annotations and to identify over 2000 new coding regions. These results will contribute to a more comprehensive genome annotation and facilitate continued research on this important insect. © 2015 American Chemical Society.		proteome, insect protein, proteome, amino acid sequence, Article, exon, genetic variability, genome, high performance liquid chromatography, honeybee, nonhuman, peptide analysis, priority journal, proteomics, social behavior, tandem mass spectrometry, animal, bee, genetics, genomics, insect genome, mass spectrometry, metabolism, molecular genetics, procedures, protein degradation, protein processing, single nucleotide polymorphism, Animals, Bees, Genome, Insect, Genomics, Insect Proteins, Mass Spectrometry, Molecular Sequence Annotation, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Protein Processing, Post-Translational, Proteolysis, Proteome, Proteomics	2016-02-05
Concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticides in honey, pollen and honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) in central Saskatchewan, Canada	Neonicotinoid insecticides (NIs) and their transformation products were detected in honey, pollen and honey bees, (Apis mellifera) from hives located within 30 km of the City of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Clothianidin and thiamethoxam were the most frequently detected NIs, found in 68 and 75% of honey samples at mean concentrations of 8.2 and 17.2 ng g-1 wet mass, (wm), respectively. Clothianidin was also found in >50% of samples of bees and pollen. Concentrations of clothianidin in bees exceed the LD50 in 2 of 28 samples, while for other NIs concentrations were typically 10-100-fold less than the oral LD50. Imidaclorpid was detected in ~30% of samples of honey, but only 5% of pollen and concentrations were <LOD in bees. Transformation products of Imidaclorpid, imidaclorpid-Olefin and imidacloprid-5-Hydroxy were detected with greater frequency and at greater mean concentrations indicating a need for more focus on potential effects of these transformation products than the untransformed, active ingredient NIs. Results of an assessment of the potential dietary uptake of NIs from honey and pollen by bees over winter, during which worker bees live longer than in summer, suggested that, in some hives, consumption of honey and pollen during over-wintering might have adverse effects on bees. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Colony failure linked to low sperm viability in honey bee (Apis mellifera) queens and an exploration of potential causative factors	Queen health is closely linked to colony performance in honey bees as a single queen is normally responsible for all egg laying and brood production within the colony. In the U. S. in recent years, queens have been failing at a high rate; with 50% or greater of queens replaced in colonies within 6 months when historically a queen might live one to two years. This high rate of queen failure coincides with the high mortality rates of colonies in the US, some years with >50% of colonies dying. In the current study, surveys of sperm viability in US queens were made to determine if sperm viability plays a role in queen or colony failure. Wide variation was observed in sperm viability from four sets of queens removed from colonies that beekeepers rated as in good health (n = 12; average viability = 92%), were replacing as part of normal management (n = 28; 57%), or where rated as failing (n = 18 and 19; 54% and 55%). Two additional paired set of queens showed a statistically significant difference in viability between colonies rated by the beekeeper as failing or in good health from the same apiaries. Queens removed from colonies rated in good health averaged high viability (ca. 85%) while those rated as failing or in poor health had significantly lower viability (ca. 50%). Thus low sperm viability was indicative of, or linked to, colony performance. To explore the source of low sperm viability, six commercial queen breeders were surveyed and wide variation in viability (range 60-90%) was documented between breeders. This variability could originate from the drones the queens mate with or temperature extremes that queens are exposed to during shipment. The role of shipping temperature as a possible explanation for low sperm viability was explored. We documented that during shipment queens are exposed to temperature spikes (<8 and > 40°C) and these spikes can kill 50% or more of the sperm stored in queen spermathecae in live queens. Clearly low sperm viability is linked to colony performance and laboratory and field data provide evidence that temperature extremes are a potential causative factor.

Determination of selected environmental contaminants in foraging honeybees	Colony losses of honeybees have been of great concern in the last years. To explain these losses, several studies have been reported, and various factors, such as pathogens and pesticides, have been considered as possible causes. Nevertheless, organic contaminants, rather than pesticides, are continuously released to the environment, and can be intercepted by honeybees during foraging with the possible consequent damage. Azoles and organophosphorus esters have been selected in this work as environmental contaminants to be monitored in honeybees. A fast and robust method has been developed to determine these organic pollutants in honeybees. It is based on matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD), which performs sample dispersion with extraction and clean up in the same step, followed by LC-ESI-MS/MS determination. Recoveries of the method varied between 73% and 119% and MQLs ranged from 0.8 to 4 ng g-1. Honeybee samples from ten apiaries located in different regions were analyzed applying the developed method. Azole compounds were found at low levels, but not in all samples, while organophosphorus esters were found in most samples whatever location. Tris-(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate, TCPP, and tributyl phosphate, TBP, were detected in all honeybees samples at levels higher than the rest of organophosphates analyzed. ï¿½ 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Measurements of Chlorpyrifos Levels in Forager Bees and Comparison with Levels that Disrupt Honey Bee Odor-Mediated Learning Under Laboratory Conditions	Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphate pesticide used around the world to protect food crops against insects and mites. Despite guidelines for chlorpyrifos usage, including precautions to protect beneficial insects, such as honeybees from spray drift, this pesticide has been detected in bees in various countries, indicating that exposure still occurs. Here, we examined chlorpyrifos levels in bees collected from 17 locations in Otago, New Zealand, and compared doses of this pesticide that cause sub-lethal effects on learning performance under laboratory conditions with amounts of chlorpyrifos detected in the bees in the field. The pesticide was detected at 17 % of the sites sampled and in 12 % of the colonies examined. Amounts detected ranged from 35 to 286 pg.bee−1, far below the LD50 of ~100 ng.bee−1. We detected no adverse effect of chlorpyrifos on aversive learning, but the formation and retrieval of appetitive olfactory memories was severely affected. Chlorpyrifos fed to bees in amounts several orders of magnitude lower than the LD50, and also lower than levels detected in bees, was found to slow appetitive learning and reduce the specificity of memory recall. As learning and memory play a central role in the behavioral ecology and communication of foraging bees, chlorpyrifos, even in sublethal doses, may threaten the success and survival of this important insect pollinator. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.		behavioral ecology, chlorpyrifos, concentration (composition), dose-response relationship, field method, guideline, honeybee, laboratory method, measurement method, memory, odor, sublethal effect, survival, New Zealand, New Zealand, Otago, South Island, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hexapoda, chlorpyrifos, fragrance, insecticide, animal, animal behavior, bee, comparative study, drug effects, learning, metabolism, physiology, Animals, Bees, Behavior, Animal, Chlorpyrifos, Insecticides, Learning, Odorants	2016-02-01
Multi-drug resistance transporters and a mechanism-based strategy for assessing risks of pesticide combinations to honey bees	Annual losses of honey bee colonies remain high and pesticide exposure is one possible cause. Dangerous combinations of pesticides, plant-produced compounds and antibiotics added to hives may cause or contribute to losses, but it is very difficult to test the many combinations of those compounds that bees encounter. We propose a mechanism-based strategy for simplifying the assessment of combinations of compounds, focusing here on compounds that interact with xenobiotic handling ABC transporters. We evaluate the use of ivermectin as a model substrate for these transporters. Compounds that increase sensitivity of bees to ivermectin may be inhibiting key transporters. We show that several compounds commonly encountered by honey bees (fumagillin, Pristine, quercetin) significantly increased honey bee mortality due to ivermectin and significantly reduced the LC50 of ivermectin suggesting that they may interfere with transporter function. These inhibitors also significantly increased honey bees sensitivity to the neonicotinoid insecticide acetamiprid. This mechanism-based strategy may dramatically reduce the number of tests needed to assess the possibility of adverse combinations among pesticides. We also demonstrate an in vivo transporter assay that provides physical evidence of transporter inhibition by tracking the dynamics of a fluorescent substrate of these transporters (Rhodamine B) in bee tissues. Significantly more Rhodamine B remains in the head and hemolymph of bees pretreated with higher concentrations of the transporter inhibitor verapamil. Mechanism-based strategies for simplifying the assessment of adverse chemical interactions such as described here could improve our ability to identify those combinations that pose significantly greater risk to bees and perhaps improve the risk assessment protocols for honey bees and similar sensitive species. © This is an open access article, free of all opyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

The genetic consequences of the anthropogenic movement of social bees	Invasive species often play a significant role in ecosystem decline and the loss of biodiversity. Nonetheless, a number of social bee species (Apidae) have been, and are still being, transported outside their native ranges for use as pollinators and honey producers. Many authors have emphasized the ecological consequences of introduced social bees. Less appreciated is that hybridization between local and introduced bees can lead to genomic extinction of indigenous bee taxa and to a loss in overall biodiversity. More directly, mating interference between introduced and native bees may result in reduced reproductive success of the indigenous taxa. It is therefore important that the benefits of introducing exotic bee species be carefully weighed against the possible costs to indigenous populations. © 2015, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).		bee, biodiversity, ecosystem service, extinction, honey, hybridization, invasive species, mating disruption, native species, pollinator, reproductive success, social insect, Apidae, Apoidea	2016-02-01
Influence of pesticide use in fruit orchards during blooming on honeybee mortality in 4 experimental apiaries	Samples of dead honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) were collected periodically from 4 different locations during citrus and stone fruit trees blooming season to evaluate the potential impact of agrochemicals on honey bee death rate. For the determination of mortality, dead honey bee traps were placed in front of the experimental hives entrance located in areas of intensive agriculture in Valencian Community (Spain). A total of 34 bee samples, obtained along the monitoring period, were analyzed by means of QuEChERS extraction method and screened for 58 pesticides or their degradation products by LC-MS/MS. An average of four pesticides per honey bee sample was detected. Coumaphos, an organophosphate acaricide used against varroosis in the experimental hives, was detected in 94% of the samples. However, this acaricide was unlikely to be responsible for honey bee mortality because its constantly low concentration during all the monitoring period, even before and after acute mortality episodes. The organophosphates chlorpyrifos and dimethoate, as well as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, were the most frequently detected agrochemicals. Almost 80% of the samples had chlorpyrifos, 68% dimethoate, and 32% imidacloprid. Maximum concentrations for these three compounds were 751, 403, 223. ng/g respectively. Influence of these pesticides on acute honey bee mortality was demonstrated by comparing coincidence between death rate and concentrations of chlorpyrifos, dimethoate and imidacloprid. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Exposure of native bees foraging in an agricultural landscape to current-use pesticides	The awareness of insects as pollinators and indicators of environmental quality has grown in recent years, partially in response to declines in honey bee (Apis mellifera) populations. While most pesticide research has focused on honey bees, there has been less work on native bee populations. To determine the exposure of native bees to pesticides, bees were collected from an existing research area in northeastern Colorado in both grasslands (2013-2014) and wheat fields (2014). Traps were deployed bi-monthly during the summer at each land cover type and all bees, regardless of species, were composited as whole samples and analyzed for 136 current-use pesticides and degradates. This reconnaissance approach provides a sampling of all species and represents overall pesticide exposure (internal and external). Nineteen pesticides and degradates were detected in 54 composite samples collected. Compounds detected in >. 2% of the samples included: insecticides thiamethoxam (46%), bifenthrin (28%), clothianidin (24%), chlorpyrifos (17%), imidacloprid (13%), fipronil desulfinyl (7%; degradate); fungicides azoxystrobin (17%), pyraclostrobin (11%), fluxapyroxad (9%), and propiconazole (9%); herbicides atrazine (19%) and metolachlor (9%). Concentrations ranged from 1 to 310. ng/g for individual pesticides. Pesticides were detected in samples collected from both grasslands and wheat fields; the location of the sample and the surrounding land cover at the 1000. m radius influenced the pesticides detected but because of a small number of temporally comparable samples, correlations between pesticide concentration and land cover were not significant. The results show native bees collected in an agricultural landscape are exposed to multiple pesticides, these results can direct future research on routes/timing of pesticide exposure and the design of future conservation efforts for pollinators. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Does the Honey Bee "risk Cup" Runneth Over? Estimating Aggregate Exposures for Assessing Pesticide Risks to Honey Bees in Agroecosystems	Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are uniquely vulnerable to nontarget pesticide impacts because, as ubiquitous managed pollinators, they are deliberately transported into areas where crops are grown with pesticides. Moreover, attributes making them excellent managed pollinators, including large long-lived colonies and complex behavior, also make them challenging subjects for toxicity bioassays. For over 150 years, improvements in formulation and delivery of pesticides, increasing their environmental and temporal presence, have had unintended consequences for honey bees. Since 1996, the Environmental Protection Agency has used "aggregate risk"-exposure risks to all possible sources-to set tolerances; once a "risk cup" is filled, no new pesticide or use can be approved unless risks are reduced elsewhere. The EPA now recommends a modeling approach for aggregating all exposure risks for bees, with differential lifestage sensitivity and exposure probabilities. Thus, the honey bee is the first insect with its own "risk cup"-a technological innovation that may not have unintended consequences for this beleaguered beneficial species. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

MicroRNAs in Honey Bee Caste Determination	The cellular mechanisms employed by some organisms to produce contrasting morphological and reproductive phenotypes from the same genome remains one of the key unresolved issues in biology. Honeybees (Apis mellifera) use differential feeding and a haplodiploid sex determination system to generate three distinct organismal outcomes from the same genome. Here we investigate the honeybee female and male caste-specific microRNA and transcriptomic molecular signatures during a critical time of larval development. Both previously undetected and novel miRNAs have been discovered, expanding the inventory of these genomic regulators in invertebrates. We show significant differences in the microRNA and transcriptional profiles of diploid females relative to haploid drone males as well as between reproductively distinct females (queens and workers). Queens and drones show gene enrichment in physio-metabolic pathways, whereas workers show enrichment in processes associated with neuronal development, cell signalling and caste biased structural differences. Interestingly, predicted miRNA targets are primarily associated with non-physio-metabolic genes, especially neuronal targets, suggesting a mechanistic disjunction from DNA methylation that regulates physio-metabolic processes. Accordingly, miRNA targets are under-represented in methylated genes. Our data show how a common set of genetic elements are differentially harnessed by an organism, which may provide the remarkable level of developmental flexibility required.		insect protein, microRNA, transcriptome, animal, bee, female, gene, gene expression profiling, gene expression regulation, genetics, genome, growth, development and aging, larva, male, metabolism, phenotype, RNA interference, sex determination process, Animals, Bees, Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Genes, Insect, Genome, Insect Proteins, Larva, Male, MicroRNAs, Phenotype, RNA Interference, Sex Determination Processes, Transcriptome	2016-01-07
Simultaneous determination of 200 pesticide residues in honey using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in conjunction with streamlined quantification approach	A sensitive, accurate and reliable multi-class GC-MS/MS assay protocol for quantification and confirmation of 200 common agricultural pesticides in honey was developed and validated according to EU guidelines. A modified extraction procedure, based on QuEChERS method (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) was employed. Mass spectrophotometric conditions were individually optimized for each analyte to achieve maximum sensitivity and selectivity in MRM mode. The use of at least two reactions for each compound allowed simultaneous identification and quantification in a single run. The pesticides under investigation were separated in less than 31min using the ultra-inert capillary column (DB-35MS). For all analytes, neat standard calibration curves in conjunction with correction for matrix effect were successfully employed. The detection limits of the assay ranged from 1.00 to 3.00ngmL-1for the studied pesticides. The developed assay was linear over concentration range of 10.00-500.00ngmL-1, with correlation coefficient of more than 0.996. At the LOQ, 81% of the studied pesticides were efficiently recovered in the range of 70.00-120.00%, with CV% less than 15.00% while 99.3% compounds had mean percentage recovery of 60.00-140.00%, with CV% less than 21.00% (N=18, over three different days). The proposed assay was successfully applied for the analysis of the studied pesticide residues in one PT sample and 64 commercial honey samples collected over 1year from different districts around Egypt. Results revealed that only one honey sample out of the 64 analyzed samples was contaminated with tau-Fluvalinate (10.00μgkg-1). This wide scope assay protocol is applicable for monitoring pesticide residues in honey by national regulatory authorities and accredited labs; that should help ensure safety of such widely used product. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Pollen contaminated with field-relevant levels of cyhalothrin affects honey bee survival, nutritional physiology, and pollen consumption behavior	Honey bees are exposed to a variety of environmental factors that impact their health, including nutritional stress, pathogens, and pesticides. In particular, there has been increasing evidence that sublethal exposure to pesticides can cause subtle, yet important effects on honey bee health and behavior. Here, we add to this body of knowledge by presenting data on bee-collected pollen containing sublethal levels of cyhalothrin, a pyrethroid insecticide, which, when fed to young honey bees, resulted in significant changes in lifespan, nutritional physiology, and behavior. For the first time, we show that when young, nest-aged bees are presented with pollen containing field-relevant levels of cyhalothrin, they reduce their consumption of contaminated pollen. This indicates that, at least for some chemicals, young bees are able to detect contamination in pollen and change their behavioral response, even if the contamination levels do not prevent foraging honey bees from collecting the contaminated pollen. © The Authors 2015.

Belgian honey bee winter mortality during 2012-2013: a case-control study and spatial analysis	An increase in honey bee mortality has been reported within and outside the European Union. A Belgian honey bee health monitoring was started in 2012 based on a standardized and pan-European voluntary surveillance program (EPILOBEE). The main objective was to estimate honey bee mortality during winter and the apicultural season using a harmonized survey. For the Belgian study, the guidelines were adapted according to small-scale Belgian beekeeping practices and previous pathogen prevalence studies. A two-stage sampling stratified by province resulted in 150 apiaries selected from a sampling frame of approximately 3,000 registered beekeepers. These apiaries were visited twice, questionnaires were completed, collecting information on risk factors and mortality. Samples systematically taken in autumn were screened / quantified for Varroa destructor mites. Weighted colony winter mortality rates were estimated per individual apiary and for geographical entities. We then attempted to identify risk factors in a case-control data interpretation, with observed mortality as a binary dependent variable. Questionnaire variables were evaluated in univariable logistic regression. The final multivariable model was retained: age of beekeeper, wanting to continue beekeeping, increasing number of surrounding landscapes, average colony varroa infestation level, all associated with increased mortality. Chemical acaricide treatment before 1 September and Thymol-containing acaricide were associated with lower mortality. The predictive accuracy of this final model was estimated by the area under the curve (AUC) and was 80.70%. The final predicted mortality risk was visualized on a map as an interpolated layer and compared with the observed mortality; clusters of high/low mortality were identified. This analysis has generated further hypotheses and highlighted where the case-control study could benefit from increased sample size. © 2016 International Bee Research Association.			2016-01-01
Simultaneous detection of Nosema spp., Ascosphaera apis and Paenibacillus larvae in honey bee products	Honey bees are responsible for pollinating many native and cultivated plant species. These insects can be affected by many pathogens, including fungi and bacteria, both of which can form spores that are easily dispersed within the colony by means of the stored products, among other routes. The objective of this study was to develop a method to detect spores of the honey bee pathogens Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae, Ascosphaera apis and Paenibacillus larvae in samples of honey, bee pollen and royal jelly. The method was standardized for each product individually, and then analyzed by monoplex and multiplex PCR, which showed the same detection thresholds: 1.25 spores/mL of honey for N. ceranae; 7.5 spores/mL of honey for A. apis; and 0.4 spore/mL of honey for P. larvae, respectively. The standardized technique was effective and rapid for the detection of these pathogens in bee products and can be used for the establishment of official methods of sanitary control of bee products, considering the growing national and international trade of these products and the movement or migration of colonies between regions.			2016-01-01
Effect of entomopathogenic nematodes, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora on galleria mellonella in bee hives of apis mellifera	Background: Wax worms caused economically damage in storage wax, chemicals which uses in control caused bad effect on stored bee honey inside combs. The present study was carried out to investigate the effect of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) on Galleria mellonella (Gm) in the natural bee hives. Materials and Methods: Seven different inoculum levels of Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (Hb) (100, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 and 5000 Ijs mL-1) were investigated on wax worms (Gm), larvae and adult of honey bees Apis mellifera inside the bee hives for 1 and 2 times. Results: The highest mortality percentage were 90 and 100% when 5000 Ijs mL-1. were used for once and twice, respectively. On the other hand, the EPNs didnʼt effect on larvae or adult of honey bees. The initial population (Pi), final population (Pf) and rate of reproduction (Rr) were affected with the increase of EPNs inoculum levels and duplication of treatment. The Pi was 648.00 and 766.67 per insect cadaver at 5000 IJs for 1 and 2 times. The highest Pf was 61083.33 and 246166.7 when 2000 IJs were used for 1 and 2 times, respectively. Conclusion: The high concentration of EPNs cause 100% mortality for G. mellonella and there is no side effect on larvae or adult of honey bees. The EPNs can be used to control G. mellonella instead of chemicals without worried about honey bee. © 2016 Entsar H. Taha and Sawsan M.

The effect of oxalic acid applied by sublimation on honey bee colony fitness: A comparison with amitraz	Oxalic acid is one of the organic acids used for controlling Varroa destructor, a mite parasitizing the honey bee (Apis mellifera). The aim of this work was to examine the effect of oxalic acid applied by sublimation on honey bee colony fitness, and to compare it with the effect of amitraz, a routinely used synthetic acaricide. Bee colonies of equal strength were randomly divided into two groups. In December 2014, one group was treated with amitraz in the form of aerosol, and the second group was treated with oxalic acid applied by sublimation. The colonies were monitored over winter. Dead bees found at the bottom of the hive were counted regularly and examined microscopically for infection with Nosema sp. (Microsporidia). At the end of March 2015, living foragers from each hive were sampled and individually examined for Nosema sp. infection. Colony strength was evaluated at the beginning of April. No adverse effect of oxalic acid on colony strength was observed despite the fact that the total number of dead bees was non-significantly higher in the oxalic acid-treated group. Examination of dead bees for Nosema infection did not reveal significant differences in spore numbers between the experimental groups. There was a substantial difference in living individuals, however, with a significantly higher amount of spores per bee found in the amitraz-treated colonies compared to the oxalic acid-treated colonies. Compared to amitraz, oxalic acid applied by sublimation showed no adverse effects on bee colony fitness or on successful overwintering. © 2016, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

An Evaluation of the Honey Bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Safety Profile of a New Systemic Insecticide, Flupyradifurone, Under Field Conditions in Florida	Flupyradifurone (Sivanto) is a novel systemic insecticide from the butenolide class developed by Bayer. Based on available data (USEPA 2014), this insecticide appears to have a favorable safety profile for honey bee colonies. As a result, the label permits the product to be applied during prebloom and bloom in various crops, including citrus, except when mixed with azole fungicides during the blooming period. We placed 24 honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies adjacent to eight flowering buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) fields that either had been sprayed with the maximum label rate of flupyradifurone or with water only (control fields), with three colonies placed adjacent to each field. We conducted colony strength assessments during which the number of adult bees, eggs, uncapped brood cells, capped brood cells, food storage cells, and weights of honey supers and brood chambers were determined prior to, during, and after the flowering period. We also analyzed bee-collected pollen and nectar for flupyradifurone residues. Overall, there were no differences in any colony strength parameter for colonies placed at control and flupyradifurone-treated buckwheat fields. Residue analyses showed that pollen (x = 565.8 ppb) and nectar (x = 259.4 ppb) gathered by bees on fields treated with flupyradifurone contained significantly higher flupyradifurone residues than did bee bread and unprocessed nectar collected by bees from control fields (75% of samples <LOD). Within the conditions set forth by our experimental design, our collective data suggest no adverse effects of flupyradifurone on honey bee colonies when following label directions. © 2016 The Authors.		flupyradifurone, gamma butyrolactone, insecticide, nectar, pyridine derivative, analogs and derivatives, analysis, animal, apiculture, bee, chemistry, drug effects, Fagopyrum, Florida, growth, development and aging, honey, nectar, ovum, pollen, randomization, 4-Butyrolactone, Animals, Beekeeping, Bees, Fagopyrum, Florida, Honey, Insecticides, Ovum, Plant Nectar, Pollen, Pyridines, Random Allocation	2016-01-01

Identification of business informatics specifics in agricultural enterprises	Presented paper deals with analysis and identification of business informatics specifics in agricultural enterprises in the Czech Republic farming at land of size up to 500 hectares. The study is based on thorough review of literature about latest issues in agriculture business informatics. There is a follow up to certain results of previous research on business informatics in agriculture that was conducted by authors in 2013. The analysis has brought findings that business informatics has several peculiarities that must be regarded in informatics implementation and innovation. Those are common economic and organisational effects and further aspects typical for the agriculture such as climate, local conditions and seasonal nature of production.		agricultural economics, business development, farm, information system, Czech Republic	2016-01-01
Sugar and protein content in different monofloral pollens - Building a database	Pollen is the only protein source for the honey bee colony. Its nutritional quality varies according to the floral origin. The total protein content is a very important information in many research fields. Nevertheless its interpretation may be falsified by the sugars which are the main component of pollen pellets. In this paper we provide a database containing sugar and nitrogen content of 40 different pollen types. ï¿½ 2016, Universita degli Studi di Bologna, Department of Agroenvironmental Sciences and Technologies.

Pollen nutrition in honey bees (Apis mellifera): impact on adult health	Pollen is the main protein source for honey bees, and its quality and digestibility are important factors for bee health. We compared the effects of eight different mixed-pollen diets on queenless adult survival and physiology. The mixtures represented the pollen source for bees in a natural environment. They consisted of three to five familial pollen types, and the protein percentage varied from 8.4 to 18.1 %. The mixtures that contained mainly Asteraceae pollen were less consumed and enhanced bee mortality, suggesting that this pollen type offers poor nutritional quality and assimilation for the bees. All pollen diets promoted ovarian activation, but among the pollen-treated groups, the percentage of bees with activated ovaries was not related to the protein content of the diet, which suggests that ovarian activation may also depend on other nutrients. Survival was also positively correlated to the vitellogenin levels in the hemolymph. Our results showed that the amount of protein consumption and the pollen type influenced bee survival and physiology. © 2015, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		adult, artificial diet, blood, dicotyledon, digestibility, food quality, health impact, honeybee, mortality, nutrition, physiological response, pollen, protein, reproductive health, survival, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Asteraceae	2016-01-01
Presence of wild and managed bees in the agricultural crops: Overview of available data to reduce pesticide risk	In France, a derogation to pesticide regulation allows spraying on blooms with insecticides or acaricides bearing the bee label (mention ï¿½ Abeilles ï¿½), but only when no bees are foraging on crops. Nevertheless, no decision rule is available for farmers to assess bees' absence on the crop. To fill this gap, the Ministry of Agriculture initiated a reflection about environmental and climatic factors influencing the presence of forager bees. This review takes an inventory of data available about foraging activity according to environment or weather. Decision rules based on such criteria appear inappropriate. Only nocturnal sprays of pesticides on crops significantly reduce the risk of bees' exposure to chemicals. ï¿½ A. Decourtye et al., Published by EDP Sciences 2016.			2016-01-01
Distributions of neonicotinoid insecticides in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts: A temporal and spatial variation analysis for pollen and honey samples	It is known that honeybees are exposed to a wide variety of pesticides, including systemic neonicotinoids, through different media. Pollen might be a better matrix for assessing exposure to neonicotinoid not only because it is the protein source for bees, but also because pollen collected from foraging bees could help to establish the field-realistic levels of neonicotinoids. In this study, we aimed to assess temporal and spatial variations of neonicotinoids in pollen collected across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Monthly pollen samples and a honey sample were collected between April and August 2013 from 62 volunteered hives and analysed for eight neonicotinoids. We utilised the relative potency factor (RPF) method to integrate individual neonicotinoids into a single measurement of imidaclopridRPF. We then analysed the spatial and temporal variations of imidaclopridRPF in pollen using the response profile analysis. Overall, 73% of pollen and 72% of honey samples contained at least one detectable neonicotinoid. We found that 49, 20 and 4% of pollen samples contained one, two and three neonicotinoids respectively. In honey, we detected that 57 and 15% of samples contained one and two neonicotinoids respectively. Neonicotinoids as a group, or imidacloprid, in pollen exhibited no significant temporal or spatial variation, however, we found statistically significant spatialoral interaction differences of imidaclopridRPF concentrations. Considering the ubiquitous of neonicotinoids in the environment and their effects on bees at the sub-lethal levels, it is prudent to identify ways to minimise the uses of neonicotinoids in order to reduce the risk of neonicotinoid exposure to honeybees. © 2016 CSIRO.		honey, imidacloprid, neonicotinoid pesticide, palynology, spatial distribution, spatial variation, temporal variation, Massachusetts, United States, Apoidea	2016-01-01
Vanishing bees: Science, politics, and honeybee health	In 2005, beekeepers in the United States began observing a mysterious and disturbing phenomenon: once-healthy colonies of bees were suddenly collapsing, leaving behind empty hives. As it explores the contours of this crisis, Vanishing Bees considers an equally urgent question: what happens when beekeepers, farmers, scientists, agrichemical corporations, and government regulators approach the problem from different vantage points and cannot see eye-to-eye?

Viral infections of Apis mellifera: Its importance, dynamics, diagnostics and treatment opportunities	Honey bees (Apis mellifera) play a crucial function in terrestrial ecosystems by maintaining floral biodiversity and providing sustainable agriculture through pollination. Bees affect 35% of the world's crop production, hence, they are essential for economic sustainability, agriculture and food security. The economic value of pollination by bees goes beyond agricultural production. An important role of bees is pollination of the plants that provide food to the wild animals, and this is part of the proper functioning of the ecosystem. On the one hand Apis mellifera has great adaptive potential and it may be found in highly diverse climates almost everywhere in the world, but on the other hand bees are under constant threat by numerous pathogens including bacteria, viruses, fungi, Microsporidia, mites and insects. Other stress factors include environmental change-related stresses, pesticides, malnutrition and migratory beekeeping. The interactions among these, along with possibly other unknown factors, are causing widespread decline in honey bee populations – Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) syndrome. Viruses are the most recent and still poorly investigated pathogens of the honey bees. Simultaneously, Varroa destructor mites and viruses are currently the high-profile suspects in collapsing bee colonies. Varroa acts as a vector for a range of RNA viruses of honey bees which are transferred when the mite feeds on hemolymph from the developing pupa. This publication aims to present an overview of the most important honey bee viruses, their diagnostics methods and treatment opportunities with emphasis on the most common and devastating viruses from Dicistroviridae and Iflaviridae families. ï¿½ 2016, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry.

Silencing the honey bee (Apis mellifera) naked cuticle gene (nkd) improves host immune function and reduces Nosema ceranae infections	Nosema ceranae is a new and emerging microsporidian parasite of European honey bees, Apis mellifera, that has been implicated in colony losses worldwide. RNA interference (RNAi), a posttranscriptional gene silencing mechanism, has emerged as a potent and specific strategy for controlling infections of parasites and pathogens in honey bees. While previous studies have focused on the silencing of parasite/pathogen virulence factors, we explore here the possibility of silencing a host factor as a mechanism for reducing parasite load. Specifically, we used an RNAi strategy to reduce the expression of a honey bee gene, naked cuticle (nkd), which is a negative regulator of host immune function. Our studies found that nkd mRNA levels in adult bees were upregulated by N. ceranae infection (and thus, the parasite may use this mechanism to suppress host immune function) and that ingestion of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific to nkd efficiently silenced its expression. Furthermore, we found that RNAimediated knockdown of nkd transcripts in Nosema-infected bees resulted in upregulation of the expression of several immune genes (Abaecin, Apidaecin, Defensin-1, and PGRP-S2), reduction of Nosema spore loads, and extension of honey bee life span. The results of our studies clearly indicate that silencing the host nkd gene can activate honey bee immune responses, suppress the reproduction of N. ceranae, and improve the overall health of honey bees. This study represents a novel host-derived therapeutic for honey bee disease treatment that merits further exploration. ï¿½ 2016, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

Genome sequencing and analysis of the first complete genome of Lactobacillus kunkeei strain MP2, an Apis mellifera gut isolate	Background. The honey bee (Apis mellifera) is the most important pollinator in agriculture worldwide. However, the number of honey bees has fallen significantly since 2006, becoming a huge ecological problem nowadays. The principal cause is CCD, or Colony Collapse Disorder, characterized by the seemingly spontaneous abandonment of hives by their workers. One of the characteristics of CCD in honey bees is the alteration of the bacterial communities in their gastrointestinal tract, mainly due to the decrease of Firmicutes populations, such as the Lactobacilli. At this time, the causes of these alterations remain unknown. We recently isolated a strain of Lactobacillus kunkeei (L. kunkeei strain MP2) from the gut of Chilean honey bees. L. kunkeei, is one of the most commonly isolated bacterium from the honey bee gut and is highly versatile in different ecological niches. In this study, we aimed to elucidate in detail, the L. kunkeei genetic background and perform a comparative genome analysis with other Lactobacillus species. Methods. L. kunkeei MP2 was originally isolated from the guts of Chilean A. mellifera individuals. Genome sequencing was done using Pacific Biosciences single-molecule real-time sequencing technology. De novo assembly was performed using Celera assembler. The genome was annotated using Prokka, and functional information was added using the EggNOG 3.1 database. In addition, genomic islands were predicted using IslandViewer, and pro-phage sequences using PHAST. Comparisons between L. kunkeei MP2 with other L. kunkeei, and Lactobacillus strains were done using Roary. Results. The complete genome of L. kunkeei MP2 comprises one circular chromosome of 1,614,522 nt. with a GC content of 36,9%. Pangenome analysis with 16 L. kunkeei strains, identified 113 unique genes, most of them related to phage insertions. A large and unique region of L. kunkeei MP2 genome contains several genes that encode for phage structural protein and replication components. Comparative analysis of MP2 with other Lactobacillus species, identified several unique genes of L. kunkeei MP2 related with metabolism, biofilm generation, survival under stress conditions, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Discussion. The presence of multiple mobile genetic elements, including phage sequences, suggest a high degree of genetic variability in L. kunkeei. Its versatility and ability to survive in different ecological niches (bee guts, flowers, fruits among others) could be given by its genetic capacity to change and adapt to different environments. L. kunkeei could be a new source of Lactobacillus with beneficial properties. Indeed, L. kunkeei MP2 could play an important role in honey bee nutrition through the synthesis of components as isoprenoids. © 2016 Asenjo et al.		phosphoribulokinase, ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase, RNA 16S, Apis mellifera, Article, bacterial strain, bacterium isolation, DNA isolation, genome analysis, intermethod comparison, intestine flora, Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus kunkeei MP2, microbial community, nonhuman, nucleotide sequence, phylogeny, real time polymerase chain reaction, sequence analysis	2016-01-01
In vivo and in vitro infection dynamics of honey bee viruses	The honey bee (Apis mellifera) is commonly infected by multiple viruses. We developed an experimental system for the study of such mixed viral infections in newly emerged honey bees and in the cell line AmE-711, derived from honey bee embryos. When inoculating a mixture of iflavirids [sacbrood bee virus (SBV), deformed wing virus (DWV)] and dicistrovirids [Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), black queen cell virus (BQCV)] in both live bee and cell culture assays, IAPV replicated to higher levels than other viruses despite the fact that SBV was the major component of the inoculum mixture. When a different virus mix composed mainly of the dicistrovirid Kashmir bee virus (KBV) was tested in cell culture, the outcome was a rapid increase in KBV but not IAPV. We also sequenced the complete genome of an isolate of DWV that covertly infects the AmE-711 cell line, and found that this virus does not prevent IAPV and KBV from accumulating to high levels and causing cytopathic effects. These results indicate that different mechanisms of virus-host interaction affect virus dynamics, including complex virus-virus interactions, superinfections, specific virus saturation limits in cells and virus specialization for different cell types.			2016-01-01
Bee abundance and nutritional status in relation to grassland management practices in an agricultural landscape	Grasslands provide important resources for pollinators in agricultural landscapes. Managing grasslands with fire and grazing has the potential to benefit plant and pollinator communities, though there is uncertainty about the ideal approach. We examined the relationships among burning and grazing regimes, plant communities, and Bombus species and Apis mellifera L. abundance and nutritional indicators at the Grand River Grasslands in southern Iowa and northern Missouri. Treatment regimes included burn-only, grazed-and-burned, and patchburn graze (pastures subdivided into three temporally distinct fire patches with free access by cattle). The premise of the experimental design was that patch-burn grazing would increase habitat heterogeneity, thereby providing more diverse and abundant floral resources for pollinators. We predicted that both bee abundance and individual bee nutritional indicators (bee size and lipid content) would be positively correlated with floral resource abundance. There were no significant differences among treatments with respect to bee abundance. However, some of the specific characteristics of the plant community showed significant relationships with bee response variables. Pastures with greater abundance of floral resources had greater bee abundance but lower bee nutritional indicators. Bee nutritional variables were positively correlated with vegetation height, but, in some cases, negatively correlated with stocking rate. These results suggest grassland site characteristics such as floral resource abundance and stocking rate are of potential importance to bee pollinators and suggest avenues for further research to untangle the complex interactions between grassland management, plant responses, and bee health. © The Authors 2016.

Effects of the herbicide dicamba on nontarget plants and pollinator visitation	Nearly 80% of all pesticides applied to row crops are herbicides, and these applications pose potentially significant ecotoxicological risks to nontarget plants and associated pollinators. In response to the widespread occurrence of weed species resistant to glyphosate, biotechnology companies have developed crops resistant to the synthetic-auxin herbicides dicamba and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D); and once commercialized, adoption of these crops is likely to change herbicide-use patterns. Despite current limited use, dicamba and 2,4-D are often responsible for injury to nontarget plants; but effects of these herbicides on insect communities are poorly understood. To understand the influence of dicamba on pollinators, the authors applied several sublethal, drift-level rates of dicamba to alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and Eupatorium perfoliatum L. and evaluated plant flowering and floral visitation by pollinators. The authors found that dicamba doses simulating particle drift (≈1% of the field application rate) delayed onset of flowering and reduced the number of flowers of each plant species; however, plants that did flower produced similar-quality pollen in terms of protein concentrations. Further, plants affected by particle drift rates were visited less often by pollinators. Because plants exposed to sublethal levels of dicamba may produce fewer floral resources and be less frequently visited by pollinators, use of dicamba or other synthetic-auxin herbicides with widespread planting of herbicide-resistant crops will need to be carefully stewarded to prevent potential disturbances of plant and beneficial insect communities in agricultural landscapes. © 2016 SETAC.

Probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus reduces organophosphate pesticide absorption and toxicity to Drosophila melanogaster	Organophosphate pesticides used in agriculture can pose health risks to humans and wildlife. We hypothesized that dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus, a genus of commensal bacteria, would reduce absorption and toxicity of consumed organophosphate pesticides (parathion and chlorpyrifos [CP]). Several Lactobacillus species were screened for toleration of 100 ppm of CP or parathion in MRS broth based on 24-h growth curves. Certain Lactobacillus strains were unable to reach stationary-phase culture maxima and displayed an abnormal culture morphology in response to pesticide. Further characterization of commonly used, pesticide-tolerant and pesticide-susceptible, probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG (LGG) and L. rhamnosus strain GR-1 (LGR-1), respectively, revealed that both strains could significantly sequester organophosphate pesticides from solution after 24-h coincubations. This effect was independent of metabolic activity, as L. rhamnosus GG did not hydrolyze CP and no difference in organophosphate sequestration was observed between live and heat-killed strains. Furthermore, LGR-1 and LGG reduced the absorption of 100 μM parathion or CP in a Caco-2 Transwell model of the small intestine epithelium. To determine the effect of sequestration on acute toxicity, newly eclosed Drosophila melanogaster flies were exposed to food containing 10 μM CP with or without supplementation with live LGG. Supplementation with LGG simultaneously, but not with administration of CP 3 days prior (prophylactically), mitigated CP-induced mortality. In summary, the results suggest that L. rhamnosus may be useful for reducing toxic organophosphate pesticide exposure via passive binding. These findings could be transferable to clinical and livestock applications due to affordability and practical ability to supplement products with food-grade bacteria. ï¿½ 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Whole-Organism Cellular Pathology: A Systems Approach to Phenomics	Phenotype is defined as the state of an organism resulting from interactions between genes, environment, disease, molecular mechanisms, and chance. The purpose of the emerging field of phenomics is to systematically determine and measure phenotypes across biology for the sake of understanding. Phenotypes can affect more than one cell type and life stage, so ideal phenotyping would include the state of every cell type within the context of both tissue architecture and the whole organism at each life stage. In medicine, high-resolution anatomic assessment of phenotype is obtained from histology. Histology's interpretative power, codified by Virchow as cellular pathology, is derived from its ability to discern diagnostic and characteristic cellular changes in diseased tissues. Cellular pathology is observed in every major human disease and relies on the ability of histology to detect cellular change in any cell type due to unbiased pan-cellular staining, even in optically opaque tissues. Our laboratory has shown that histology is far more sensitive than stereomicroscopy for detecting phenotypes in zebrafish mutants. Those studies have also shown that more complete sampling, greater consistency in sample orientation, and the inclusion of phenotypes extending over longer length scales would provide greater coverage of common phenotypes. We are developing technical approaches to achieve an ideal detection of cellular pathology using an improved form of X-ray microtomography that retains the strengths and addresses the weaknesses of histology as a screening tool. We are using zebrafish as a vertebrate model based on the overlaps between zebrafish and mammalian tissue architecture, and a body size small enough to allow whole-organism, volumetric imaging at cellular resolution. Automation of whole-organism phenotyping would greatly increase the value of phenomics. Potential societal benefits would include reduction in the cost of drug development, a reduction in the incidence of unexpected severe drug and environmental toxicity, and more rapid elucidation of the contributions of genes and the environment to phenotypes, including the validation of candidate disease alleles identified in population and personal genetics. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.		animal, animal model, environment, genomics, human, phenotype, physiology, procedures, zebra fish, Animals, Environment, Genomics, Humans, Models, Animal, Phenotype, Zebrafish	2016-01-01
Bee health: Background and issues for congress	Bees, both commercially managed honey bees and wild bees, play an important role in global food production. In the United States alone, the value of insect pollination to U.S. agricultural production is estimated at $16 billion annually, of which about three-fourths is attributable to honey bees. Worldwide, the contribution of bees and other insects to global crop production for human food is valued at about $190 billion. Given the importance of honey bees and other bee species to food production, many have expressed concern about whether a “pollinator crisis” has been occurring in recent decades. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.			2016-01-01
Varroa destructor (mesostigmata: Varroidae) parasitism and climate differentially influence the prevalence, levels, and overt infections of deformedwing virus in honey bees (hymenoptera: Apidae)	The prevalence and loads of deformed wing virus (DWV) between honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies from a tropical and a temperate environment were compared. The interaction between these environments and the mite Varroa destructor in relation to DWV prevalence, levels, and overt infections, was also analyzed. V. destructor rates were determined, and samples of mites, adult bees, brood parasitized with varroa mites and brood not infested by mites were analyzed. DWV was detected in 100% of themites and its prevalence and loads in honey bees were significantly higher in colonies from the temperate climate than in colonies from the tropical climate. Significant interactions were found between climate and type of sample, with the highest levels of DWV found in varroa-parasitized brood from temperate climate colonies. Additionally, overt infections were observed only in the temperate climate. Varroa parasitism and DWV loads in bees from colonies with overt infections were significantly higher than in bees from colonies with covert infections. These results suggest that interactions between climate, V. destructor, and possibly other factors, may play a significant role in the prevalence and levels of DWV in honey bee colonies, as well as in the development of overt infections. Several hypotheses are discussed to explain these results. ï¿½ The Author 2016.

European isolates of the Microsporidia Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae have similar virulence in laboratory tests on European worker honey bees	Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae are gut parasites that infect western honey bees (Apis mellifera) worldwide. N. ceranae is an exotic infectious disease agent of A. mellifera, having been originally described in the Asian honey bee (Apis cerana), while N. apis is native to the western honey bee. To better understand the dynamics and epidemiology of the two pathogens, we examined the impact of European isolates of both Microsporidia on the longevity of European A. mellifera in a controlled laboratory experiment. N. ceranae caused slightly higher host mortality compared to N. apis, but differences in virulence were subtle and non-significant. Variation across published studies may reflect geographic differences in the coadaptation of hosts and parasites and seasonal differences in host susceptibility. © 2015, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		adaptation, digestive system, disease vector, epidemiology, fungus, geographical variation, honeybee, infectious disease, laboratory method, longevity, mortality, native species, parasite, pathogen, survival, virulence, worker caste, Europe, Apis cerana, Apis mellifera, Microsporidia, Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae	2016-01-01
Identification of complete repertoire of apis florea odorant receptors reveals complex orthologous relationships with apis mellifera	Wedevelopedacomputationalpipeline forhomologybased identificationof thecomplete repertoireofolfactory receptor (OR)genes in theAsian honey bee species, Apis florea. Apis florea is phylogenetically themost basal honey bee species and also themost distant sister species to the Western honey bee Apis mellifera, for which all OR genes had been identified before. Using our pipeline, we identified180ORgenes inA.florea,which is very similar tothenumberofORsidentified inA. mellifera (177ORs).Manycharacteristics of the ORs including gene structure, synteny of tandemly repeated ORs and basic phylogenetic clustering are highly conserved. The composite phylogenetic tree of A. florea and A. melliferaORs could be divided into 21 clades which are in harmony with the existing Hymenopteran tree. However, we found a few nonorthologous OR relationships between both species as well as independent pseudogenization ofORs suggestingseparate evolutionary changes. Particularly, a subgroup of theORgenecladeXI, whichhadbeen hypothesized to code cuticular hydrocarbon receptors showed a high number of species-specific ORs. RNAseq analysis detected a total number of 145 OR transcripts in male and 162 in female antennae. Most of the OR geneswere highly expressed on the female antennae. However, we detected five distinct male-biased OR genes, out of which three genes (AfOr11, AfOr18, AfOr170P) were shown to be male-biased in A. mellifera, too, thus corroborating a behavioral function in sex-pheromone communication. © The Author 2016.		amino acid sequence, animal, antenna (organ), bee, chemistry, classification, evolution, female, gene, gene expression profiling, genetics, growth, development and aging, male, metabolism, olfactory receptor, phylogeny, sequence analysis, sequence homology, species difference, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Arthropod Antennae, Bees, Biological Evolution, Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Genes, Insect, Male, Phylogeny, Receptors, Odorant, Sequence Analysis, RNA, Sequence Homology, Species Specificity	2016-01-01
Epigenetics and its applications to children’s health	Epigenetics represents the study of inheritable changes in the regulation of DNA expression during development. It represents a normal process by which totipotent early cells differentiate and commit to specific tissues, organs, and other structures that are properly arranged and are functional to enable optimum organizational performance. Exposure to nutritional deficits or excess, environmental toxins and endocrine disruptors, and both psychological and physiological stress can produce epigenetic reprogramming, so that affected cells and tissues alter functioning, leading to morbidity and premature mortality. Epigenetic changes in the germ line can produce transgenerational, inherited gene regulatory changes. Within an individual lifespan, altered gene regulation via hyper- or hypo-methylation, acetylation, and the action of endogenous genetic elements leads to aging and growth abnormalities, including cancer, immune dysfunction, and cardiovascular disease. ï¿½ Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.			2016-01-01
Protecting an Ecosystem Service: Approaches to Understanding and Mitigating Threats to Wild Insect Pollinators	Insect pollination constitutes an ecosystem service of global importance, providing significant economic and aesthetic benefits as well as cultural value to human society, alongside vital ecological processes in terrestrial ecosystems. It is therefore important to understand how insect pollinator populations and communities respond to rapidly changing environments if we are to maintain healthy and effective pollinator services. This chapter considers the importance of conserving pollinator diversity to maintain a suite of functional traits and provide a diverse set of pollinator services. We explore how we can better understand and mitigate the factors that threaten insect pollinator richness, placing our discussion within the context of populations in predominantly agricultural landscapes in addition to urban environments. We highlight a selection of important evidence gaps, with a number of complementary research steps that can be taken to better understand: (i) the stability of pollinator communities in different landscapes in order to provide diverse pollinator services; (ii) how we can study the drivers of population change to mitigate the effects and support stable sources of pollinator services and (iii) how we can manage habitats in complex landscapes to support insect pollinators and provide sustainable pollinator services for the future. We advocate a collaborative effort to gain higher quality abundance data to understand the stability of pollinator populations and predict future trends. In addition, for effective mitigation strategies to be adopted, researchers need to conduct rigorous field testing of outcomes under different landscape settings, acknowledge the needs of end-users when developing research proposals and consider effective methods of knowledge transfer to ensure effective uptake of actions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.			2016-01-01
Pesticide toxicity to non-target organisms: Exposure, toxicity and risk assessment methodologies	The pesticide should cause effect on the target pests and be selective enough to spare the non-target beneficial. The book deals with the pesticide toxicity to predators, parasitoids and microbes which are used for pest management in the agroecosystem. The other beneficials exposed to pesticides are pollinators, earthworms, silkworm and fishes. The book contains information on the modes of pesticide exposure and toxicity to the organisms, sub-lethal effects of insecticides and method of toxicity assessment, risk assessment of pesticidal application in the field. The purpose of the work is to compile and present the different procedures to assess pesticide poising in organisms related to the agroecosystem along with discussions on risk assessment procedures with clear comparison of toxicity of pesticides to target pests and non target beneficial organisms. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016.			2016-01-01
A sensitive and efficient method for routine pesticide multiresidue analysis in bee pollen samples using gas and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry	Several clean-up methods were evaluated for 253 pesticides in pollen samples concentrating on efficient clean-up and the highest number of pesticides satisfying the recovery and precision criteria. These were: (a) modified QuEChERS using dSPE with PSA+C18; (b) freeze-out prior to QuEChERS using dSPE with PSA+C18; (c) freeze-out prior to QuEChERS using dSPE with PSA+C18+Z-Sep; and (d) freeze-out followed by QuEChERS using dSPE with PSA+C18 and SPE with Z-Sep. Determinations were made using LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS. The modified QuEChERS protocol applying a freeze-out followed by dSPE with PSA+C18 and SPE clean-up with Z-Sep was selected because it provided the highest number of pesticides with mean recoveries in the 70-120% range, as well as relative standard deviations (RSDs) typically below 20% (12.2% on average) and ensured much better removal of co-extracted matrix compounds of paramount importance in routine analysis. Limits of quantification at levels as low as 5μgkg-1were obtained for the majority of the pesticides. The proposed methodology was applied to the analysis of 41 pollen bee samples from different areas in Spain. Pesticides considered potentially toxic to bees (DL50<2μg/bee) were detected in some samples with concentrations up to 72.7μgkg-1, which could negatively affect honeybee health. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Omega-3 deficiency impairs honey bee learning	Deficiency in essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly the long-chain form of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), has been linked to health problems in mammals, including many mental disorders and reduced cognitive performance. Insects have very low long-chain PUFA concentrations, and the effect of omega-3 deficiency on cognition in insects has not been studied. We show a low omega-6:3 ratio of pollen collected by honey bee colonies in heterogenous landscapes and in many hand-collected pollens that we analyzed. We identified Eucalyptus as an important bee-forage plant particularly poor in omega-3 and high in the omega-6:3 ratio. We tested the effect of dietary omega-3 deficiency on olfactory and tactile associative learning of the economically highly valued honey bee. Bees fed either of two omega-3-poor diets, or Eucalyptus pollen, showed greatly reduced learning abilities in conditioned proboscis-extension assays compared with those fed omega-3-rich diets, or omega-3-rich pollen mixture. The effect on performance was not due to reduced sucrose sensitivity. Omega-3 deficiency also led to smaller hypopharyngeal glands. Bee brains contained high omega-3 concentrations, which were only slightly affected by diet, suggesting additional peripheral effects on learning. The shift from a low to high omega-6:3 ratio in the Western human diet is deemed a primary cause of many diseases and reduced mental health. A similar shift seems to be occurring in bee forage, possibly an important factor in colony declines. Our study shows the detrimental effect on cognitive performance of omega-3 deficiency in a nonmammal.		omega 3 fatty acid, sucrose, fatty acid, omega 3 fatty acid, omega 6 fatty acid, animal cell, animal experiment, Article, controlled study, essential fatty acid deficiency, Eucalyptus, forage, honeybee, hypopharynx, learning disorder, lipid composition, nonhuman, priority journal, state dependent learning, animal, bee, brain chemistry, chemistry, cognition, conditioned reflex, learning, physiology, pollen, Animals, Bees, Brain Chemistry, Cognition, Conditioning, Classical, Fatty Acids, Fatty Acids, Omega-3, Fatty Acids, Omega-6, Learning, Pollen	2015-12-22
Economic Dependence of U.S. Industrial Sectors on Animal-Mediated Pollination Service	Declining animal pollinator health and diversity in the U.S. is a matter of growing concern and has particularly gained attention since the emergence of colony collapse disorder (CCD) in 2006. Failure to maintain adequate animal-mediated pollination service to support increasing demand for pollination-dependent crops poses risks for the U.S. economy. We integrate the Economic Input-Output (EIO) model and network analysis with data on pollinator dependence of crops to understand the economic dependence of U.S. industrial sectors on animal-mediated pollination service. The novelty of this work lies in its ability to identify industrial sectors and industrial communities (groups of closely linked sectors) that are most vulnerable to scarcity of pollination service provided by various animal species. While the economic dependence of agricultural sectors on pollination service is significant (US14.2-23.8 billion), the higher-order economic dependence of the rest of the U.S. industrial sectors is substantially high as well (US10.3-21.1 billion). The results are compelling as they highlight the critical importance of animal-induced pollination service for the U.S. economy, and the need to account for the role of ecosystem goods and services in product life cycles. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

Impact of imidacloprid on new queens of imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)	Neonicotinoid insecticides are commonly used in managing pest insects, including the imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren. There is increasing evidence that neonicotinoid insecticides at sublethal concentrations have profound effects on social insects. However, the sublethal effect of neonicotinoids on S. invicta has never been investigated. In this study, the newly mated queens were fed with water containing 0.01 or 0.25 μg/ml imidacloprid. Imidacloprid at both concentrations did not cause any increase in queen mortality during the founding stage; however, it significantly reduced queens' brood tending ability. In the 0.25 μg/ml imidacloprid treatment, the time to larval emergence was significantly delayed and no pupae or adult workers were produced. This study provides clear evidence that imidacloprid at sublethal concentrations has a significant detrimental impact on S. invicta queens and the development of incipient colonies.		imidacloprid, imidazole derivative, insecticide, nitro derivative, animal, ant, drug effects, physiology, reproduction, Animals, Ants, Imidazoles, Insecticides, Nitro Compounds, Reproduction	2015-12-08
Native wildflower plantings support wild bee abundance and diversity in agricultural landscapes across the United States	Global trends in pollinator-dependent crops have raised awareness of the need to support managed and wild bee populations to ensure sustainable crop production. Provision of sufficient forage resources is a key element for promoting bee populations within human impacted landscapes, particularly those in agricultural lands where demand for pollination service is high and land use and management practices have reduced available flowering resources. Recent government incentives in North America and Europe support the planting of wildflowers to benefit pollinators; surprisingly, in North America there has been almost no rigorous testing of the performance of wildflower mixes, or their ability to support wild bee abundance and diversity. We tested different wildflower mixes in a spatially replicated, multiyear study in three regions of North America where production of pollinatordependent crops is high: Florida, Michigan, and California. In each region, we quantified flowering among wildflower mixes composed of annual and perennial species, and with high and low relative diversity. We measured the abundance and species richness of wild bees, honey bees, and syrphid flies at each mix over two seasons. In each region, some but not all wildflower mixes provided significantly greater floral display area than unmanaged weedy control plots. Mixes also attracted greater abundance and richness of wild bees, although the identity of best mixes varied among regions. By partitioning floral display size from mix identity we show the importance of display size for attracting abundant and diverse wild bees. Season-long monitoring also revealed that designing mixes to provide continuous bloom throughout the growing season is critical to supporting the greatest pollinator species richness. Contrary to expectation, perennials bloomed in their first season, and complementarity in attraction of pollinators among annuals and perennials suggests that inclusion of functionally diverse species may provide the greatest benefit. Wildflower mixes may be particularly important for providing resources for some taxa, such as bumble bees, which are known to be in decline in several regions of North America. No mix consistently attained the full diversity that was planted. Further study is needed on how to achieve the desired floral display and diversity from seed mixes. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.		abundance, agricultural land, bee, biodiversity, crop improvement, flower, fly, forage, habitat availability, native species, pollination, productivity, size effect, species diversity, species richness, wild population, California, Florida [United States], Michigan, North America, United States, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Bombus (genus), Syrphidae, agriculture, animal, bee, biodiversity, classification, environmental monitoring, flower, physiology, plant, pollination, United States, wild animal, Agriculture, Animals, Animals, Wild, Bees, Biodiversity, Environmental Monitoring, Flowers, Plants, Pollination, United States	2015-12-01
Effects of Oral Exposure to Fungicides on Honey Bee Nutrition and Virus Levels	Sublethal exposure to fungicides can affect honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) in ways that resemble malnutrition. These include reduced brood rearing, queen loss, and increased pathogen levels. We examined the effects of oral exposure to the fungicides boscalid and pyraclostrobin on factors affecting colony nutrition and immune function including pollen consumption, protein digestion, hemolymph protein titers, and changes in virus levels. Because the fungicides are respiratory inhibitors, we also measured ATP concentrations in flight muscle. The effects were evaluated in 3- and 7-d-old worker bees at high fungicide concentrations in cage studies, and at field-relevant concentrations in colony studies. Though fungicide levels differed greatly between the cage and colony studies, similar effects were observed. Hemolymph protein concentrations were comparable between bees feeding on pollen with and without added fungicides. However, in both cage and colony studies, bees consumed less pollen containing fungicides and digested less of the protein. Bees fed fungicide-treated pollen also had lower ATP concentrations and higher virus titers. The combination of effects we detected could produce symptoms that are similar to those from poor nutrition and weaken colonies making them more vulnerable to loss from additional stressors such as parasites and pathogens. © 2015 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America.		adenosine triphosphate, biphenyl derivative, carbamic acid derivative, fungicide, nicotinamide, peptide hydrolase, Pristine (fungicide), protein, pyrazole derivative, analogs and derivatives, animal, bee, chemistry, digestion, drug effects, enzymology, hemolymph, herbivory, intestine, metabolism, muscle, oral drug administration, pollen, virology, Adenosine Triphosphate, Administration, Oral, Animals, Bees, Biphenyl Compounds, Carbamates, Digestion, Fungicides, Industrial, Hemolymph, Herbivory, Intestines, Muscles, Niacinamide, Peptide Hydrolases, Pollen, Proteins, Pyrazoles	2015-12-01
Taxonomic characterization of honey bee (Apis mellifera) pollen foraging based on non-overlapping paired-end sequencing of nuclear ribosomal loci	Identifying plant taxa that honey bees (Apis mellifera) forage upon is of great apicultural interest, but traditional methods are labor intensive and may lack resolution. Here we evaluate a high-throughput genetic barcoding approach to characterize trap-collected pollen from multiple North Dakota apiaries across multiple years. We used the Illumina MiSeq platform to generate sequence scaffolds from non-overlapping 300-bp paired-end sequencing reads of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS). Full-length sequence scaffolds represented ~530 bp of ITS sequence after adapter trimming, drawn from the 5' of ITS1 and the 3' of ITS2, while skipping the uninformative 5.8S region. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were picked from scaffolds clustered at 97% identity, searched by BLAST against the nt database, and given taxonomic assignments using the paired-read lowest common ancestor approach. Taxonomic assignments and quantitative patterns were consistent with known plant distributions, phenology, and observational reports of pollen foraging, but revealed an unexpected contribution from non-crop graminoids and wetland plants. The mean number of plant species assignments per sample was 23.0 (+/- 5.5) and the mean species diversity (effective number of equally abundant species) was 3.3 (+/- 1.2). Bray- Curtis similarities showed good agreement among samples from the same apiary and sampling date. Rarefaction plots indicated that fewer than 50,000 reads are typically needed to characterize pollen samples of this complexity. Our results show that a pre-compiled, curated reference database is not essential for genus-level assignments, but species-level assignments are hindered by database gaps, reference length variation, and probable errors in the taxonomic assignment, requiring post-hoc evaluation. Although the effective per-sample yield achieved using custom MiSeq amplicon primers was less than the machine maximum, primarily due to lower "read2" quality, further protocol optimization and/ or a modest reduction in multiplex scale should offset this difficulty. As small quantities of pollen are sufficient for amplification, our approach might be extendable to other questions or species for which large pollen samples are not available.		amplicon, Apis mellifera, DNA transcription, error, foraging, genetic transcription, genus, honeybee, identity, machine, phenology, reference database, sampling, species diversity, United States, wetland, animal, bee, chemistry, classification, DNA sequence, genetics, geography, phylogeny, physiology, plant, pollen, pollination, plant DNA, Animals, Bees, DNA, Plant, Geography, Phylogeny, Plants, Pollen, Pollination, Sequence Analysis, DNA	2015-12-01
Sublethal Effect of Imidacloprid on Solenopsis invicta (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) Feeding, Digging, and Foraging Behavior	There is increasing evidence that exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides at sublethal levels impairs colonies of honeybees and other pollinators. Recently, it was found that sublethal contamination with neonicotinoids also affect growth and behavior of ants. In this study, we exposed red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta Buren, to sublethal dosages of dietary imidacloprid and investigated its effect on ant feeding, digging, and foraging behavior. S. invicta consumed significantly more sugar water containing 0.01 μg/ml imidacloprid than untreated sugar water. Ants fed with 0.01 μg/ml imidacloprid also showed significantly increased digging activity than ants fed with untreated sugar water. However, imidacloprid at ≥ 0.25 μg/ml significantly suppressed sugar water consumption, digging, and foraging behavior. These results indicate that imidacloprid at sublethal concentrations may have a significant and complicated effect on S. invicta. © 2015 Crown.		ant, behavioral response, colony, dose-response relationship, feeding behavior, foraging behavior, growth rate, honeybee, imidacloprid, pollinator, recruitment (population dynamics), sublethal effect, sugar, Formicidae, Hymenoptera, Solenopsis invicta, carbohydrate, imidacloprid, imidazole derivative, insecticide, nitro derivative, animal, animal behavior, ant, appetite, decision making, drug effects, feeding behavior, Animals, Ants, Appetitive Behavior, Behavior, Animal, Carbohydrates, Choice Behavior, Feeding Behavior, Imidazoles, Insecticides, Nitro Compounds	2015-12-01
Spray Toxicity and Risk Potential of 42 Commonly Used Formulations of Row Crop Pesticides to Adult Honey Bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae)	To combat an increasing abundance of sucking insect pests, >40 pesticides are currently recommended and frequently used as foliar sprays on row crops, especially cotton. Foraging honey bees may be killed when they are directly exposed to foliar sprays, or they may take contaminated pollen back to hives that maybe toxic to other adult bees and larvae. To assess acute toxicity against the honey bee, we used a modified spray tower to simulate field spray conditions to include direct whole-body exposure, inhalation, and continuing tarsal contact and oral licking after a field spray. A total of 42 formulated pesticides, including one herbicide and one fungicide, were assayed for acute spray toxicity to 4-6-d-old workers. Results showed significantly variable toxicities among pesticides, with LC50s ranging from 25 to thousands of mg/liter. Further risk assessment using the field application concentration to LC1 or LC99 ratios revealed the risk potential of the 42 pesticides. Three pesticides killed less than 1% of the worker bees, including the herbicide, a miticide, and a neonicotinoid. Twenty-six insecticides killed more than 99% of the bees, including commonly used organophosphates and neonicotinoids. The remainder of the 13 chemicals killed from 1-99% of the bees at field application rates. This study reveals a realistic acute toxicity of 42 commonly used foliar pesticides. The information is valuable for guiding insecticide selection to minimize direct killing of foraging honey bees, while maintaining effective control of field crop pests. © 2015 Published by Oxford University Press [on behalf of Entomological Society of America].		insecticide, animal, bee, comparative study, risk assessment, toxicity testing, Animals, Bees, Insecticides, Risk Assessment, Toxicity Tests	2015-12-01
Superorganism resilience: Eusociality and susceptibility of ecosystem service providing insects to stressors	Insects provide crucial ecosystem services for human food security and maintenance of biodiversity. It is therefore not surprising that major declines in wild insects, combined with losses of managed bees, have raised great concern. Recent data suggest that honey bees appear to be less susceptible to stressors compared to other species. Here we argue that eusociality plays a key role for the susceptibility of insects to environmental stressors due to what we call superorganism resilience, which can be defined as the ability to tolerate the loss of somatic cells (=workers) as long as the germ line (=reproduction) is maintained. Life history and colony size appear critical for such resilience. Future conservation efforts should take superorganism resilience into account to safeguard ecosystem services by insects. © 2015 The Authors.			2015-12-01
A locomotor deficit induced by sublethal doses of pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides in the honeybee Apis mellifera	The toxicity of pesticides used in agriculture towards non-targeted organisms and especially pollinators has recently drawn the attention from a broad scientific community. Increased honeybee mortality observed worldwide certainly contributes to this interest. The potential role of several neurotoxic insecticides in triggering or potentiating honeybee mortality was considered, in particular phenylpyrazoles and neonicotinoids, given that they are widely used and highly toxic for insects. Along with their ability to kill insects at lethal doses, they can compromise survival at sublethal doses by producing subtle deleterious effects. In this study, we compared the bee's locomotor ability, which is crucial for many tasks within the hive (e.g. cleaning brood cells, feeding larvae. . .), before and after an acute sublethal exposure to one insecticide belonging to the two insecticide classes, fipronil and thiamethoxam. Additionally, we examined the locomotor ability after exposure to pyrethroids, an older chemical insecticide class still widely used and known to be highly toxic to bees as well. Our study focused on young bees (day 1 after emergence) since (i) few studies are available on locomotion at this stage and (ii) in recent years, pesticides have been reported to accumulate in different hive matrices, where young bees undergo their early development. At sublethal doses (SLD48h, i.e. causing nomortality at 48h), three pyrethroids, namely cypermethrin (2.5 ng/bee), tetramethrin (70 ng/bee), tau-fluvalinate (33 ng/bee) and the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (3.8 ng/bee) caused a locomotor deficit in honeybees. While the SLD48h of fipronil (a phenylpyrazole, 0.5 ng/bee) had no measurable effect on locomotion, we observed high mortality several days after exposure, an effect that was not observed with the other insecticides. Although locomotor deficits observed in the sublethal range of pyrethroids and thiamethoxam would suggest deleterious effects in the field, the case of fipronil demonstrates that toxicity evaluation requires information onmultiple endpoints (e.g. long term survival) to fully address pesticides risks for honeybees. Pyrethroid- induced locomotor deficits are discussed in light of recent advances regarding their mode of action on honeybee ion channels and current structure-function studies. © 2015 Charreton et al.

Using pennycress, camelina, and canola cash cover crops to provision pollinators	As pollinator decline continues, the need to provide high value forage for insects increases. Finding agricultural crops to diversify the landscape and provide forage is one way to improve pollinator health. Three winter industrial oilseed crops (pennycress, winter camelina, and winter canola) were grown in Morris, Minnesota, and Brookings, South Dakota, during the winters of 2012-2013 and 2013-2014. Each of the three crops has pollinator-friendly flowers and value as winter cover crops and cash seed crops. The crops were evaluated for pollinator use, nectar production, green cover, and yield. Pennycress, camelina, and canola flowers had high insect activity with maximum visitation rates of 67±11.5, 22±3.1, and 61±6.8 insects min-1. Cumulative nectar produced by pennycress, camelina, and canola was 13, 100, and 82kg of sugar ha-1 during the 2014 anthesis period, providing an important food resource to pollinators during early spring when there is little else on the agricultural landscape that is blooming. Green cover in early spring ranged from 0 to 60% amongst the three crops, with camelina providing >25% green cover across all four site-years. Maximum seed yields were 1.1±0.04, 1.4±0.05, and 1.2±0.19Mgha-1 for pennycress, camelina, and canola, respectively, which are economically viable harvests. Of the three crops, winter camelina provided the highest combined agroecosystem value through pollinator resources, green cover, and seed yields. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Neonicotinoid Residues in Wildflowers, a Potential Route of Chronic Exposure for Bees	In recent years, an intense debate about the environmental risks posed by neonicotinoids, a group of widely used, neurotoxic insecticides, has been joined. When these systemic compounds are applied to seeds, low concentrations are subsequently found in the nectar and pollen of the crop, which are then collected and consumed by bees. Here we demonstrate that the current focus on exposure to pesticides via the crop overlooks an important factor: throughout spring and summer, mixtures of neonicotinoids are also found in the pollen and nectar of wildflowers growing in arable field margins, at concentrations that are sometimes even higher than those found in the crop. Indeed, the large majority (97%) of neonicotinoids brought back in pollen to honey bee hives in arable landscapes was from wildflowers, not crops. Both previous and ongoing field studies have been based on the premise that exposure to neonicotinoids would occur only during the blooming period of flowering crops and that it may be diluted by bees also foraging on untreated wildflowers. Here, we show that exposure is likely to be higher and more prolonged than currently recognized because of widespread contamination of wild plants growing near treated crops. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

Correlations between land covers and honey bee colony losses in a country with industrialized and rural regions	High levels of honey bee colony losses were recently reported from Canada, China, Europe, Israel, Turkey and the United States, raising concerns of a global pollinator decline and questioning current land use practices, in particular intense agricultural cropping systems. Sixty-seven crops (data from the years 2010-2012) and 66 mid-term stable land cover classes (data from 2007) were analysed for statistical relationships with the honey bee colony losses experienced over the winters 2010/11-2012/13 in Luxembourg (Western Europe). The area covered by each land cover class, the shortest distance between each land cover class and the respective apiary, the number of plots covered by each land use class and the size of the biggest plot of each land cover class within radii of 2. km and 5. km around 166 apiaries (2010), 184 apiaries (2011) and 188 apiaries (2012) were tested for correlations with honey bee colony losses (% per apiary) experienced in the winter following the season when the crops were grown. Artificial water bodies, open urban areas, large industrial facilities including heavy industry, railways and associated installations, buildings and installations with socio-cultural purpose, camping-, sports-, playgrounds, golf courts, oilseed crops other than oilseed rape like sunflower or linseed, some spring cereals and former forest clearcuts or windthrows were the land cover classes most frequently associated with high honey bee colony losses. Grain maize, mixed forest and mixed coniferous forest were the land cover classes most frequently associated with low honey bee colony losses. The present data suggest that land covers related to transport, industry and leisure may have made a more substantial contribution to winter honey bee colony losses in developed countries than anticipated so far. Recommendations for the positioning of apiaries are discussed. © 2015.

Male mites (Varroa destructor) perceive the female sex pheromone with the sensory pit organ on the front leg tarsi	Varroa destructor males are attracted by a volatile sex pheromone of female mites. We assume that this pheromone is perceived by the sensory pit organ on the front leg tarsi. To test this hypothesis, the front legs of the males were varnished with nail polish. The behavior of the thus treated males toward attractive female mites was analyzed in our mating bioassay and compared to untreated control males and to males with varnished idiosoma. The control males with the varnished idiosoma revealed the same distinct copulation behavior as untreated males whereas the males with the varnished front legs did not show copulation attempts any more. Hence, the sensory pit organ is responsible for the perception of female signals that elicit the copulation behavior. Additionally, a first scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis is presented to characterize the male sensory pit organ. © 2015, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		bioassay, copulation, female, hypothesis testing, male, mating behavior, mite, perception, sensory system, sex pheromone, signal, Acari, Varroa destructor	2015-11-01
Effects, but no interactions, of ubiquitous pesticide and parasite stressors on honey bee (Apis mellifera) lifespan and behaviour in a colony environment	Interactions between pesticides and parasites are believed to be responsible for increased mortality of honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies in the northern hemisphere. Previous efforts have employed experimental approaches using small groups under laboratory conditions to investigate influence of these stressors on honey bee physiology and behaviour, although both the colony level and field conditions play a key role for eusocial honey bees. Here, we challenged honey bee workers under in vivo colony conditions with sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid thiacloprid, the miticide tau-fluvalinate and the endoparasite Nosema ceranae, to investigate potential effects on longevity and behaviour using observation hives. In contrast to previous laboratory studies, our results do not suggest interactions among stressors, but rather lone effects of pesticides and the parasite on mortality and behaviour, respectively. These effects appear to be weak due to different outcomes at the two study sites, thereby suggesting that the role of thiacloprid, tau-fluvalinate and N.ceranae and interactions among them may have been overemphasized. In the future, investigations into the effects of honey bee stressors should prioritize the use of colonies maintained under a variety of environmental conditions in order to obtain more biologically relevant data. © 2015 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.		fluvalinate, insecticide, nitrile, pyrethroid, pyridine derivative, thiacloprid, thiazine derivative, animal, bee, drug effects, microbiology, Nosema, pathogenicity, physiology, Animals, Bees, Insecticides, Nitriles, Nosema, Pyrethrins, Pyridines, Thiazines	2015-11-01
Effects of environmentally-relevant mixtures of four common organophosphorus insecticides on the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.)	We assessed whether exposure to environmentally-relevant mixtures of four organophosphorus insecticides (OPs) exerted adverse effects on honey bees. Adult and worker bees were orally exposed for five days under laboratory conditions to mixtures of four insecticides, diazinon, malathion, profenofos and chlorpyrifos at two concentrations. Concentration in the mixtures tested were equivalent to the median and 95th centile concentrations of the OPs in honey, as reported in the literature. Effects on survival, behavior, activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and expression of genes important in detoxification of xenobiotics and immune response were examined. Survival of worker bees was not affected by exposure to median or 95th centile concentrations of the OPs. Activity of AChE was significantly greater in worker bees exposed to the 95th centile concentration mixture of OPs compared to the median concentration mixture. Expression of genes involved in detoxification of xenobiotics was not affected by treatment, but the abundance of transcripts of the antimicrobial peptide hymenoptaecin was significantly greater in worker honey bees exposed to the median concentration mixture. Results suggest that short-term exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of a mixture of OPs do not adversely affect worker honey bees. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.		adult, antimicrobial activity, behavioral response, detoxification, dose-response relationship, enzyme activity, gene expression, honeybee, immune response, organophosphorus pesticide, peptide, pollution effect, pollution exposure, survival, worker caste, xenobiotics, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, acetylcholinesterase, chlorpyrifos, cholinesterase inhibitor, dimpylate, insecticide, malathion, organophosphate, phosphorothioic acid derivative, profenofos, animal, animal behavior, bee, gene expression, genetics, physiology, Acetylcholinesterase, Animals, Bees, Behavior, Animal, Chlorpyrifos, Cholinesterase Inhibitors, Diazinon, Gene Expression, Insecticides, Malathion, Organophosphates, Organothiophosphates	2015-11-01
Seasonal benefits of a natural propolis envelope to honey bee immunity and colony health	Honey bees, as social insects, rely on collective behavioral defenses that produce a colony-level immune phenotype, or social immunity, which in turn impacts the immune response of individuals. One behavioral defense is the collection and deposition of antimicrobial plant resins, or propolis, in the nest.We tested the effect of a naturally constructed propolis envelope within standard beekeeping equipment on the pathogen and parasite load of large field colonies, and on immune system activity, virus and storage protein levels of individual bees over the course of a year. The main effect of the propolis envelope was a decreased and more uniform baseline expression of immune genes in bees during summer and autumn months each year, compared with the immune activity in bees with no propolis envelope in the colony. The most important function of the propolis envelope may be to modulate costly immune system activity. As no differences were found in levels of bacteria, pathogens and parasites between the treatment groups, the propolis envelope may act directly on the immune system, reducing the bees' need to activate the physiologically costly production of humoral immune responses. Colonies with a natural propolis envelope had increased colony strength and vitellogenin levels after surviving the winter in one of the two years of the study, despite the fact that the biological activity of the propolis diminished over the winter. A natural propolis envelope acts as an important antimicrobial layer enshrouding the colony, benefiting individual immunity and ultimately colony health. © 2015 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.		propolis, vitellogenin, animal, bee, gene expression, immunology, metabolism, microbiology, Nosema, parasitology, physiology, season, Varroidae, Animals, Bees, Gene Expression, Nosema, Propolis, Seasons, Varroidae, Vitellogenins	2015-11-01
The influence of Nosema (Microspora: Nosematidae) infection on honey bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) defense against Varroa destructor (Mesostigmata: Varroidae)	The objectives of this study were to quantify the costs and benefits of co-parasitism with Varroa (Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman) and Nosema (Nosema ceranae Fries and Nosema apis Zander) on honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) with different defense levels. Newly-emerged worker bees from either high-mite-mortality-rate (high-MMR) bees or low-mite-mortality-rate (low-MMR) bees were confined in forty bioassay cages which were either inoculated with Nosema spores [Nosema (+) group] or were left un-inoculated [Nosema (-) group]. Caged-bees were then inoculated with Varroa mites [Varroa (+) group] or were left untreated [Varroa (-) group]. This established four treatment combinations within each Nosema treatment group: (1) low-MMR Varroa (-), (2) high-MMR Varroa (-), (3) low-MMR Varroa (+) and (4) high-MMR Varroa (+), each with five replicates. Overall mite mortality in high-MMR bees (0.12 ± 0.02 mites per day) was significantly greater than in the low-MMR bees (0.06 ± 0.02 mites per day). In the Nosema (-) groups bee mortality was greater in high-MMR bees than low-MMR bees but only when bees had a higher mite burden. Overall, high-MMR bees in the Nosema (-) group showed greater reductions in mean abundance of mites over time compared with low-MMR bees, when inoculated with additional mites. However, high-MMR bees could not reduce mite load as well as in the Nosema (-) group when fed with Nosema spores. Mean abundance of Nosema spores in live bees and dead bees of both strains of bees was significantly greater in the Nosema (+) group. Molecular analyses confirmed the presence of both Nosema species in inoculated bees but N. ceranae was more abundant than N. apis and unlike N. apis increased over the course of the experiment. Collectively, this study showed differential mite mortality rates among different genotypes of bees, however, Nosema infection restrained Varroa removal success in high-MMR bees. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.		animal, bee, disease resistance, immunology, microbiology, Nosema, parasitology, physiology, Varroidae, Animals, Bees, Disease Resistance, Nosema, Varroidae	2015-11-01
Within-colony variation in the immunocompetency of managed and feral honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) in different urban landscapes	Urbanization has the potential to dramatically affect insect populations worldwide, although its effects on pollinator populations are just beginning to be understood. We compared the immunocompetency of honey bees sampled from feral (wild-living) and managed (beekeeper-owned) honey bee colonies. We sampled foragers from feral and managed colonies in rural, suburban, and urban landscapes in and around Raleigh, NC, USA. We then analyzed adult workers using two standard bioassays for insect immune function (encapsulation response and phenoloxidase activity). We found that there was far more variation within colonies for encapsulation response or phenoloxidase activity than among rural to urban landscapes, and we did not observe any significant difference in immune response between feral and managed bees. These findings suggest that social pollinators, like honey bees, may be sufficiently robust or variable in their immune responses to obscure any subtle effects of urbanization. Additional studies of immune physiology and disease ecology of social and solitary bees in urban, suburban, and natural ecosystems will provide insights into the relative effects of changing urban environments on several important factors that influence pollinator productivity and health. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.			2015-10-29
Effects of sublethal doses of imidacloprid on young adult honeybee behaviour	Imidacloprid (IMI), a neonicotinoid used for its high selective toxicity to insects, is one of the most commonly used pesticides. However, its effect on beneficial insects such as the honeybee Apis mellifera L is still controversial. As young adult workers perform in-hive duties that are crucial for colony maintenance and survival, we aimed to assess the effect of sublethal IMI doses on honeybee behaviour during this period. Also, because this insecticide acts as a cholinergic-nicotinic agonist and these pathways take part in insect learning and memory processes; we used IMI to assess their role and the changes they suffer along early adulthood.We focused on appetitive behaviours based on the proboscis extension response. Laboratory reared adults of 2 to 10 days of age were exposed to sublethal IMI doses (0.25 or 0.50ng) administered orally or topically prior to behavioural assessment. Modification of gustatory responsiveness and impairment of learning and memory were found as a result of IMI exposure. These outcomes differed depending on age of evaluation, type of exposure and IMI dose, being the youngest bees more sensitive and the highest oral dose more toxic. Altogether, these results imply that IMI administered at levels found in agroecosystems can reduce sensitivity to reward and impair associative learning in young honeybees. Therefore, once a nectar inflow with IMI traces is distributed within the hive, it could impair in-door duties with negative consequences on colony performance. © 2015 Mengoni Goñalons, Farina.		imidacloprid, sucrose, imidacloprid, imidazole derivative, insecticide, nitro derivative, adult, adulthood, age, agroecosystem, animal behavior, animal experiment, Apis mellifera, appetite, Article, concentration (parameters), controlled study, gustatory response score, honeybee, learning disorder, lethal dose, memory consolidation, memory disorder, mortality, nonhuman, olfactory memory, organism colony, proboscis extension response, rearing, reflex, scoring system, sensorimotor function, state dependent learning, sublethal dose, young adult, animal, animal behavior, bee, conditioned reflex, drug effects, learning, memory, Animals, Appetitive Behavior, Association Learning, Bees, Behavior, Animal, Conditioning, Classical, Imidazoles, Insecticides, Memory, Nitro Compounds	2015-10-21
Prevalence and distribution of honey bee pests and pathogens in Uruguay	Here, we present the first honey bee pest and pathogen epidemiological study in Uruguay, as an attempt to increase the information about South American honey bee health status. Varroa destructor appeared to be widely distributed in the country, showing a prevalence of 75.7% in autumn. A third of affected colonies showed infestation levels above irreversible damage threshold (4%) and presented a 6-fold increased risk of being infected by deformed wing virus. Acute bee paralysis virus, black queen cell virus, and sacbrood virus were also detected, while Kashmir bee virus and Israeli acute paralysis virus were not. Nosema ceranae was the only detected microsporidium, suggesting the absence or extremely low prevalence of Nosema apis. No significant difference in pathogen distribution was observed between Africanized or European colonies. In conclusion, the main honey bee pathogens have been detected in Uruguay, showing a similar prevalence to those detected in Northern hemisphere countries, while no distribution differences were observed in Africanized or European bees. These multiple infections reflect the fragile balance of bee health worldwide. © 2016 International Bee Research Association.			2015-10-20
Effects of treatments with Apivar<sup>®</sup>and Thymovar<sup>®</sup>on V. destructor populations, virus infections and indoor winter survival of Canadian honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies	Efficacies of two miticides, Apivar® and Thymovar®, were evaluated as a fall treatment against V. destructor. The effect of treatment with miticides was further evaluated by monitoring both viral load and rate of indoor overwintering survival of colonies of European honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) in the vicinity of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Forty-five colonies were randomly assigned to three treatment groups with 15 hives per group: Group 1; 2 strips of Thymovar® (thymol); Group 2; 2 strips of Apivar® (Amitraz); and Group 3; no treatment (control). Significant decreases in the rates of colony infestation (Mites per hundred bees, MPHB) by V. destructor were observed (p < 0.05) between colonies of bees treated with Apivar® in October 2013 when compared to control colonies. Efficacy of Apivar® and Thymovar® against V. destructor after treatment for 22 days were 76.5 and 26.7%, respectively. After 22 days, concentrations of the two miticides in bees were 15.4 ng amitraz/g wet mass (wm) and 64,800 ng thymol/g wm. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in the percentage of colonies infected by deformed wing virus (DWV) and Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) either before or after treatment with Apivar® or Thymovar® in October 2013 and 7 months post treatment in April 2014. Only the Apivar® treatment group showed IAPV infections in April 2014. The group treated with Apivar® exhibited a better overwintering rate of survival (93%), than hives treated with Thymovar® (67%). These results suggest volatile miticides like Thymovar® should be avoided in geographical areas with colder fall temperatures. © 2016 International Bee Research Association.			2015-10-20
Fatty acid profiles of 20 species of monofloral bee pollen from China	Fatty acids are important nutrients contained in bee pollen and vary greatly depending on the floral species. In this study, 20 species of monofloral bee pollen from China were collected to analyze fatty acid composition. Fatty acids were identified and quantified using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry with selected ion monitor (GC-MS/SIM) and compared with reference standards of 37 fatty acid methyl esters. Our results reveal that in virtually all bee pollen samples, a broad variety of fatty acids ranging from 11 to 20 types were identified. Palmitic acid, stearic acid, α-linolenic acid, linoleic acid, eicosenoic acid and erucic acid occurred in all bee pollen samples. In addition, the presence of nervonic acid in bee pollen is a novel finding, with an average level of 0.21 mg/g. © 2016 International Bee Research Association.			2015-10-20
Selection for resistance to Varroa destructor under commercial beekeeping conditions<sup>*</sup>	A survival field test was initiated in 1999 to observe the effects of no treatment against Varroa destructor on European honey bee colony survival. After losses of over two-thirds of the 268 original colonies, new colonies were made from the survivors. In 2002, genetic material from these survivors was bred into an independent group of 60 colonies. In 2013, 519 non-treated colonies from both groups were being used for commercial beekeeping, and mite populations were very low. This indicates that under commercial beekeeping conditions, simple methods can be used to select for reduced mite populations. © 2016 The Author(s).

Passive laboratory surveillance in Spain: pathogens as risk factors for honey bee colony collapse	Many European and North American countries have reported losses in honey bee populations over recent years. Although multiple factors appear to be involved in this decline, the influence of pathogens may be particularly important. In the present study, we analyzed the presence of the major honey bee pathogens and neonicotinoid insecticides in ten professional apiaries (five affected by high honey bee colony mortality and five asymptomatic apiaries). Our results confirm that Nosema ceranae and trypanosomatids are very prevalent in the apiaries affected by depopulation and high colony loss. By contrast, and while they have been demonstrated to be highly toxic to bees, neonicotinoid insecticides do not seem to play an important role in colony mortality in these apiaries. This kind of passive surveillance system is important to collect information about pathogen incidence, particularly when supplemented with a strong system of active disease surveillance that enables emergent diseases to be detected. © 2016 International Bee Research Association.			2015-10-20
Long term effects of a food supplement HiveAlive™ on honey bee colony strength and Nosema ceranae spore counts	The long term effect of HiveAlive™, a commercial food supplement, was evaluated with respect to colony population size and Nosema ceranae spore loads. The supplement was administered in sugar syrup at a dose of 2.5 ml per liter of syrup to up to 20 colonies per group for a period of 2 years. Its use before and after winter increased a colony’s worker population size by 89% and reduced Nosema ceranae spores by 57% compared to control colonies. These results represent the first-known hive manipulation to have a lasting effect on nosema spore levels. The positive effect of HiveAlive™ may have been a result of its continued use over a two-year period. © 2016 The Author(s).

Genetics, synergists, and age affect insecticide sensitivity of the honey bee, apis mellifera	The number of honey bee colonies in the United States has declined to half of its peak level in the 1940s, and colonies lost over the winter have reached levels that are becoming economically unstable. While the causes of these losses are numerous and the interaction between them is very complex, the role of insecticides has garnered much attention. As a result, there is a need to better understand the risk of insecticides to bees, leading to more studies on both toxicity and exposure. While much research has been conducted on insecticides and bees, there have been very limited studies to elucidate the role that bee genotype and age has on the toxicity of these insecticides. The goal of this study was to determine if there are differences in insecticide sensitivity between honey bees of different genetic backgrounds (Carniolan, Italian, and Russian stocks) and assess if insecticide sensitivity varies with age. We found that Italian bees were the most sensitive of these stocks to insecticides, but variation was largely dependent on the class of insecticide tested. There were almost no differences in organophosphate bioassays between honey bee stocks (<1-fold), moderate differences in pyrethroid bioassays (1.5 to 3-fold), and dramatic differences in neonicotinoid bioassays (3.4 to 33.3-fold). Synergism bioassays with piperonyl butoxide, amitraz, and coumaphos showed increased phenothrin sensitivity in all stocks and also demonstrated further physiological differences between stocks. In addition, as bees aged, the sensitivity to phenothrin significantly decreased, but the sensitivity to naled significantly increased. These results demonstrate the variation arising from the genetic background and physiological transitions in honey bees as they age. This information can be used to determine risk assessment, as well as establishing baseline data for future comparisons to explain the variation in toxicity differences for honey bees reported in the literature.		amitraz, coumafos, imidacloprid, malathion, naled, neonicotinoid, phenothrin, piperonyl butoxide, resmethrin, thiamethoxam, insecticide, adult, age, Apis mellifera, Apis mellifera carnica, Apis mellifera ligustica, Article, body weight, controlled study, correlational study, genetic variability, genetics, genotype, insecticide sensitivity, LC50, LD50, nonhuman, pests and pest control, species difference, aging, animal, bee, bioassay, Aging, Animals, Bees, Biological Assay, Insecticides	2015-10-02

Assessing honey bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) foraging populations and the potential impact of pesticides on Eight U.S. Crops	Beekeepers who use honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) for crop pollination services, or have colonies making honey on or in close proximity to agricultural crops, are concerned about the reductions of colony foragers and ultimate weakening of their colonies. Pesticide exposure is a potential factor in the loss of foragers. During 2009-2010, we assessed changes in the field force populations of 9-10 colonies at one location per crop on each of the eight crops by counting departing foragers leaving colonies at regular intervals during the respective crop blooming periods. The number of frames of adult bees was counted before and after bloom period. For pesticide analysis, we collected dead and dying bees near the hives, returning foragers, crop flowers, trapped pollen, and corn-flowers associated with the cotton crop. The number of departing foragers changed over time in all crops except almonds; general patterns in foraging activity included declines (cotton), noticeable peaks and declines (alfalfa, blueberries, cotton, corn, and pumpkins), and increases (apples and cantaloupes). The number of adult bee frames increased or remained stable in all crops except alfalfa and cotton. A total of 53 different pesticide residues were identified in samples collected across eight crops. Hazard quotients (HQ) were calculated for the combined residues for all crop-associated samples and separately for samples of dead and dying bees. A decrease in the number of departing foragers in cotton was one of the most substantial crop-associated impacts and presented the highest pesticide risk estimated by a summed pesticide residue HQ. © The Authors 2015.

The neonicotinoid imidacloprid impairs honey bee aversive learning of simulated predation	Neonicotinoid insecticides can impair bee learning and memory - cognitive features that play a key role in colony fitness because they facilitate foraging. For example, the commonly used neonicotinoid imidacloprid reduces honey bee olfactory learning. However, no studies have previously determined whether imidacloprid can impair aversive associative learning, although such learning should enhance bee survival by allowing bees to avoid dangerous foraging sites. To mimic attempted predation of foragers, we developed an electro-mechanical predator that consistently attacked foragers with a pinching bite at a fixed force and elicited aversive olfactory learning in a sting extension response (SER) assay. We show that chronic exposure to a sublethal concentration of imidacloprid (25.6 μg l-1=20.8 ppb) over 4 days (mean of 1.5 μg per bee day-1), significantly impaired aversive short-Term learning and memory retention. Imidacloprid treatment reduced short-Term learning by 87% and memory retention by 85% in comparison with control bees. Imidacloprid therefore impairs the ability of honey bees to associate a naturalistic predation stimulus - biting - with floral odor compounds. Such learning should enhance bee survival, suggesting that xenobiotics could alter more complex ecological interactions such as predator-prey relationships. © 2015.

In-depth proteomic analysis of Varroa destructor: Detection of DWV-complex, ABPV, VdMLV and honeybee proteins in the mite	We investigated pathogens in the parasitic honeybee mite Varroa destructor using nanoLC-MS/MS (TripleTOF) and 2D-E-MS/MS proteomics approaches supplemented with affinity-chromatography to concentrate trace target proteins. Peptides were detected from the currently uncharacterized Varroa destructor Macula-like virus (VdMLV), the deformed wing virus (DWV)-complex and the acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV). Peptide alignments revealed detection of complete structural DWV-complex block VP2-VP1-VP3, VDV-1 helicase and single-amino-acid substitution A/K/Q in VP1, the ABPV structural block VP1-VP4-VP2-VP3 including uncleaved VP4/VP2, and VdMLV coat protein. Isoforms of viral structural proteins of highest abundance were localized via 2D-E. The presence of all types of capsid/coat proteins of a particular virus suggested the presence of virions in Varroa. Also, matches between the MWs of viral structural proteins on 2D-E and their theoretical MWs indicated that viruses were not digested. The absence/scarce detection of non-structural proteins compared with high-abundance structural proteins suggest that the viruses did not replicate in the mite; hence, virions accumulate in the Varroa gut via hemolymph feeding. Hemolymph feeding also resulted in the detection of a variety of honeybee proteins. The advantages of MS-based proteomics for pathogen detection, false-positive pathogen detection, virus replication, posttranslational modifications, and the presence of honeybee proteins in Varroa are discussed.		proteome, animal, genetic database, host pathogen interaction, liquid chromatography, procedures, proteomics, tandem mass spectrometry, Varroidae, virology, Animals, Chromatography, Liquid, Databases, Genetic, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Proteome, Proteomics, Tandem Mass Spectrometry, Varroidae	2015-09-11
Vision Infinity for Food Security: Some Whys, Why Nots and Hows!	A new perspective on the global food security situation and highlights the need for seeking a common vision and implementing global planning to define the manner in which the human species will manage its food security. The basic question of 'Is there enough food' is examined in general and then in some detail. The history of food production is reviewed in the hope that lessons can be learned from the past. But even after ten thousand years of experience we are not able to feed adequately about a third of our total population, despite what statistics can be made to tell us. Intensive agriculture has stripped out the nutrients that support plant growth and marginalised extensive tracts of land. The global solution to feed the growing population has been and continues to be - produce more food. Even during the last 30 years, about 95 percent of global research investments have focused mainly on increasing productivity. However about a third of the food produced, sufficient to feed over two billion hungry people, is lost or wasted in the food value chain. Climate change is another confounding factor that impinges on our discussions. Pests of all kinds continue to destroy food before and after it is harvested, even though the technology to protect it is available. A huge amount of food is wasted in value chains, particularly at the domestic level. Global food production systems are exposed to unprecedented biosecurity risks posed by invasive harmful organisms and this trend is likely to further exacerbate as current approach to biosecurity is based on the notional premise that lines on maps and the legislation that goes with them is sufficient to halt epidemics. Solutions include extending the number of cultivated plant and animal species to include those that can prosper in what are currently considered to be extreme environments. © The Author(s) 2015.

Exposure of honeybees (Apis mellifera) in Saskatchewan, Canada to organophosphorus insecticides	Concentrations of 14 organophosphorus insecticides (OPs) were measured in Apis mellifera L. (European honeybee) and hive matrices (honey and bee bread). Samples were collected from seven randomly selected colonies in central Saskatchewan during the summer of 2013. LC-MS/MS was used to identify and quantify individual OP by use of a modified quick easy cheap effective rugged safe (QuEChERS) method. Diazinon, dimethoate, and chlorpyrifos-oxon were the only OPs detected in honey with mean concentrations of 0.3, 1.5, and 0.2 ng/g, wet mass (wm), respectively. Fenamiphos, chlorpyrifos, and chlorpyrifos methyl were the only OPs detected in bee bread, with mean concentrations of 0.4, 2.7, and 15.8 ng/g, wm, respectively, while ethoprop, malathion, and dichlorvos were the only OPs detected in bees with mean concentrations of 1.4, 3.7, and 889.2 ng/g, wm, respectively. Total hazard quotients (HQs), based on lethality of bees exposed to OPs in honey and pollen consumed by bees ranged from 0.01 to 0.06 and based on lethality of bees from direct exposure to OPs ranged from 0.3 to 0.4 which suggests little hazard of OPs to Saskatchewan beehives. © 2015, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		bioaccumulation, honey, honeybee, organophosphorus pesticide, pollen, pollution exposure, pollution monitoring, risk assessment, Canada, Saskatchewan, Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2015-09-03
Risk factors associated with failures of Varroa treatments in honey bee colonies without broodless period	The treatment against Varroa destructor has become a basic tool in beekeeping practices, mainly during autumn. The treatment effectiveness should be improved by identifying variables affecting the final outcome. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors associated with the treatment outcome achieved during autumn control of Varroa destructor. The mite infestation after treatment was evaluated in 62 apiaries and data regarding management practices were collected by means of a questionnaire. A mixed-effects model was constructed to associate management variables with the risk of treatment failure occurrence. Colonies with high mite levels prior to treatment (P = 0.002) and owned by beekeepers who did not frequently replace queens (P = 0.001) were associated with a higher risk of treatment failure. Other beekeeping practices indirectly improved treatment effectiveness. An integrated strategy for controlling mites that includes chemotherapy and suitable beekeepers management is needed to keep mite populations low during winter. © 2015, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		apiculture, autumn, best management practice, brood parasitism, chemotherapy, honeybee, integrated pest management, mite, numerical model, parasite, risk factor, Acari, Apis mellifera, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2015-09-03
Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry determination for multiclass pesticides from insect samples by microwave-assisted solvent extraction followed by a salt-out effect and micro-dispersion purification	The effects of phyto-pharmaceutic compounds (PPCs), such as neonicotinoids, on wildlife reproduction and survival are a rising concern. Yet, understanding the biological consequences of PPC use is particularly complex given the large diversity of PPCs and their derivatives to which wildlife can be exposed. Here, we present a simple and sensitive method for the simultaneous detection and quantification of multiclass PPCs (54 molecules) in single insect boluses (<0.05 g dry mass) by ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). A key part of this new method is the use of a two-step extraction method combining (i) the high efficiency of a microwave-assisted solvent extraction (MAE) for extracting analytes that might be tightly bound to environmental matrices and (ii) the versatility of a salt-out effect adapted from the QuEChERS methodology allowing the extraction and purification of a wide array of analytes. This microwave-assisted salt-out extraction (MASOE) approach was compared to classical extraction methods including matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), and the QuEChERS method. Average recoveries for 54 analytes ranged from 49% to 106%, (relative standard deviations <22%). The limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs) were in the ranges of 0.10-3.00 ng g-1 and 0.40-7.00 ng g-1, respectively. We applied this method to analyse 881 insect boluses collected from Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolour) nestlings along an agricultural intensification gradient in southern Québec (Canada). We detected 25 PPCs out of the 54 considered. We detected at least one PPC in 30% of samples and were able to quantify at least one of them in 17% of samples. Our study shows that the MASOE method should prove to be a powerful tool for studying the fate and impacts of PPCs on wildlife. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Characterization of two species of trypanosomatidae from the Honey Bee Apis mellifera: Crithidia mellificae Langridge and McGhee, and Lotmaria passim n. gen., n. sp.	Trypanosomatids are increasingly recognized as prevalent in European honey bees (Apis mellifera) and by default are attributed to one recognized species, Crithidia mellificae Langridge and McGhee, 1967. We provide reference genetic and ultrastructural data for type isolates of C. mellificae (ATCC 30254 and 30862) in comparison with two recent isolates from A. mellifera (BRL and SF). Phylogenetics unambiguously identify strains BRL/SF as a novel taxonomic unit distinct from C. mellificae strains 30254/30862 and assign all four strains as lineages of a novel clade within the subfamily Leishmaniinae. In vivo analyses show strains BRL/SF preferably colonize the hindgut, lining the lumen as adherent spheroids in a manner identical to previous descriptions from C. mellificae. Microscopy images show motile forms of C. mellificae are distinct from strains BRL/SF. We propose the binomial Lotmaria passim n. gen., n. sp. for this previously undescribed taxon. Analyses of new and previously accessioned genetic data show C. mellificae is still extant in bee populations, however, L. passim n. gen., n. sp. is currently the predominant trypanosomatid in A. mellifera globally. Our findings require that previous reports of C. mellificae be reconsidered and that subsequent trypanosomatid species designations from Hymenoptera provide genetic support. © 2015 The Author(s) Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology © 2015 International Society of Protistologists.		cladistics, flagellate, genetic analysis, honeybee, identification method, parasite, taxonomy, type specimen, ultrastructure, Europe, Apidae, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Crithidia, Hymenoptera, Kinetoplastida, Leptomonas, Mastigophora (flagellates), Protista, Trypanosomatidae, anatomy and histology, animal, axenic culture, bee, classification, Crithidia, genetics, isolation and purification, molecular genetics, parasitology, phylogeny, physiology, Animals, Axenic Culture, Bees, Crithidia, Molecular Sequence Data, Phylogeny	2015-09-01
Biopesticide-induced behavioral and morphological alterations in the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata	Because of their natural origin, biopesticides are assumed to be less harmful to beneficial insects, including bees, and therefore their use has been widely encouraged for crop protection. There is little evidence, however, to support this ingrained notion of biopesticide safety to pollinators. Because larval exposure is still largely unexplored in ecotoxicology and risk assessment on bees, an investigation was performed on the lethal and sublethal effects of a diet treated with 2 bioinsecticides, azadirachtin and spinosad, on the stingless bee, Melipona quadrifasciata, which is one of the most important pollinators in the Neotropics. Survival of stingless bee larvae was significantly compromised at doses above 210ng a.i./bee for azadirachtin and 114ng a.i./bee for spinosad. No sublethal effect was observed on larvae developmental time, but doses of both compounds negatively affected pupal body mass. Azadirachtin produced deformed pupae and adults as a result of its insect growth regulator properties, but spinosad was more harmful and produced greater numbers of deformed individuals. Only spinosad compromised walking activity of the adult workers at doses as low as 2.29ng a.i./bee, which is 1/5000 of the maximum field recommended rate. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that bioinsecticides can pose significant risks to native pollinators with lethal and sublethal effects; future investigations are needed on the likelihood of such effects under field conditions. © 2015 SETAC.

Application of hyperspectral remote sensing for flower mapping in African savannas	We tested the suitability and accuracy of hyperspectral data to produce the first African flowering and short-term floral cycle map. The spatial distribution and abundance, as well as the floral cycle, of melliferous plants are of utmost importance for evaluating pollination effects and to understand the relationship between melliferous plants in the landscape and the quantity and quality of bee keeping products. For a study site in Kenya, airborne AISA/Eagle hyperspectral data with 60. cm. pixel resolution (400 to 990. nm spectral ranges) was captured in January 2014, at the beginning of the prime flowering period, and during the prime flowering period in February 2013. Aerial digital imagery with 10. cm. pixel size and Smartphone captures in the field were used for reference data collection. The flowering species were grouped into functional flowering plant groups. Linear spectral unmixing and Change Vector Analysis (CVA) were used on the bi-temporal AISA/Eagle data to produce a hard cover map showing the spatial distribution, abundance and short-term flowering cycle of melliferous plants. Overall accuracies were slightly higher in the February 2013 imagery at the prime flowering period; all flowering plant groups together ("All") could be mapped with an overall accuracy of 83% (. n=. 512). The "White forbs" flowering plant group was most accurately mapped in both AISA/Eagle acquisition dates. Based on Duncan's inter-class similarity test, the "White forbs" group was also most distinct from other flowering plant groups. There is a need to investigate the effect of spectral endmember variability and upscaling options for space-borne monitoring of the floral cycle at key sites in Africa. Floral cycle maps can help decision makers and bee keepers to understand how bee colonies interact with the floral environment and what to expect from an apiary in terms of honey flow. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Neonicotinoid insecticides and their impacts on bees: A systematic review of research approaches and identification of knowledge gaps	It has been suggested that the widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides threatens bees, but research on this topic has been surrounded by controversy. In order to synthesize which research approaches have been used to examine the effect of neonicotinoids on bees and to identify knowledge gaps, we systematically reviewed research on this subject that was available on the Web of Science and PubMed in June 2015. Most of the 216 primary research studies were conducted in Europe or North America (82%), involved the neo-nicotinoid imidacloprid (78%), and concerned the western honey bee Apis mellifera (75%). Thus, little seems to be known about neonicotinoids and bees in areas outside Europe and North America. Furthermore, because there is considerable variation in ecological traits among bee taxa, studies on honey bees are not likely to fully predict impacts of neonicotinoids on other species. Studies on crops were dominated by seed-treated maize, oilseed rape (canola) and sunflower, whereas less is known about potential side effects on bees from the use of other application methods on insect pollinated fruit and vegetable crops, or on lawns and ornamental plants. Laboratory approaches were most common, and we suggest that their capability to infer real-world consequences are improved when combined with information from field studies about realistic exposures to neonicotinoids. Studies using field approaches often examined only bee exposure to neonicotinoids and more field studies are needed that measure impacts of exposure. Most studies measured effects on individual bees. We suggest that effects on the individual bee should be linked to both mechanisms at the sub-individual level and also to the consequences for the colony and wider bee populations. As bees are increasingly facing multiple interacting pressures future research needs to clarify the role of neonicotinoids in relative to other drivers of bee declines. © 2015 Lundin et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.		acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, neonicotinoid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, imidazole derivative, insecticide, nitro derivative, Apis mellifera, Article, Bombus impatiens, Bombus terrestris, environmental exposure, environmental impact, France, fruit vegetable, geographic distribution, Italy, maize, nonhuman, ornamental plant, plant seed, pollination, rapeseed, sunflower, systematic review, United Kingdom, United States, animal, bee, crop, drug effects, Europe, meta analysis, methodology, North America, physiology, publication, statistics and numerical data, Animals, Bees, Crops, Agricultural, Europe, Imidazoles, Insecticides, Nitro Compounds, North America, Research Design, Serial Publications	2015-08-27
Using DNA metabarcoding to identify the floral composition of honey: A new tool for investigating honey bee foraging preferences	Identifying the floral composition of honey provides a method for investigating the plants that honey bees visit. We compared melissopalynology, where pollen grains retrieved from honey are identified morphologically, with a DNA metabarcoding approach using the rbcL DNA barcode marker and 454-pyrosequencing. We compared nine honeys supplied by beekeepers in the UK. DNA metabarcoding and melissopalynology were able to detect the most abundant floral components of honey. There was 92% correspondence for the plant taxa that had an abundance of over 20%. However, the level of similarity when all taxa were compared was lower, ranging from 22-45%, and there was little correspondence between the relative abundance of taxa found using the two techniques. DNA metabarcoding provided much greater repeatability, with a 64% taxa match compared to 28% with melissopalynology. DNA metabarcoding has the advantage over melissopalynology in that it does not require a high level of taxonomic expertise, a greater sample size can be screened and it provides greater resolution for some plant families. However, it does not provide a quantitative approach and pollen present in low levels are less likely to be detected. We investigated the plants that were frequently used by honey bees by examining the results obtained from both techniques. Plants with a broad taxonomic range were detected, covering 46 families and 25 orders, but a relatively small number of plants were consistently seen across multiple honey samples. Frequently found herbaceous species were Rubus fruticosus, Filipendula ulmaria, Taraxacum officinale, Trifolium spp., Brassica spp. and the non-native, invasive, Impatiens glandulifera. Tree pollen was frequently seen belonging to Castanea sativa, Crataegus monogyna and species of Malus, Salix and Quercus.We conclude that although honey bees are considered to be supergeneralists in their foraging choices, there are certain key species or plant groups that are particularly important in the honey bees environment. The reasons for this require further investigation in order to better understand honey bee nutritional requirements. DNA metabarcoding can be easily and widely used to investigate floral visitation in honey bees and can be adapted for use with other insects. It provides a starting point for investigating how we can better provide for the insects that we rely upon for pollination.

Seasonal Variation of Honeybee Pathogens and its Association with Pollen Diversity in Uruguay	Honeybees are susceptible to a wide range of pathogens, which have been related to the occurrence of colony loss episodes reported mainly in north hemisphere countries. Their ability to resist those infections is compromised if they are malnourished or exposed to pesticides. The aim of the present study was to carry out an epidemiological study in Uruguay, South America, in order to evaluate the dynamics and interaction of honeybee pathogens and evaluate their association with the presence of external stress factors such as restricted pollen diversity and presence of agrochemicals. We monitored 40 colonies in two apiaries over 24 months, regularly quantifying colony strength, parasite and pathogen status, and pollen diversity. Chlorinated pesticides, phosphorus, pyrethroid, fipronil, or sulfas were not found in stored pollen in any colony or season. Varroa destructor was widespread in March (end of summer–beginning of autumn), decreasing after acaricide treatments. Viruses ABPV, DWV, and SBV presented a similar trend, while IAPV and KBV were not detected. Nosema ceranae was detected along the year while Nosema apis was detected only in one sample. Fifteen percent of the colonies died, being associated to high V. destructor mite load in March and high N. ceranae spore loads in September. Although similar results have been reported in north hemisphere countries, this is the first study of these characteristics in Uruguay, highlighting the regional importance. On the other side, colonies with pollen of diverse botanical origins showed reduced viral infection levels, suggesting that an adequate nutrition is important for the development of healthy colonies. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Pyrethroids and nectar toxins have subtle effects on the motor function, grooming and wing fanning behaviour of honeybees (Apis mellifera)	Sodium channels, found ubiquitously in animal muscle cells and neurons, are one of the main target sites of many naturally-occurring, insecticidal plant compounds and agricultural pesticides. Pyrethroids, derived from compounds found only in the Asteraceae, are particularly toxic to insects and have been successfully used as pesticides including on flowering crops that are visited by pollinators. Pyrethrins, from which they were derived, occur naturally in the nectar of some flowering plant species. We know relatively little about how such compounds-i.e., compounds that target sodium channels-influence pollinators at low or sub-lethal doses. Here, we exposed individual adult forager honeybees to several compounds that bind to sodium channels to identify whether these compounds affect motor function. Using an assay previously developed to identify the effect of drugs and toxins on individual bees, we investigated how acute exposure to 10 ng doses (1 ppm) of the pyrethroid insecticides (cyfluthrin, tau-fluvalinate, allethrin and permethrin) and the nectar toxins (aconitine and grayanotoxin I) affected honeybee locomotion, grooming and wing fanning behaviour. Bees exposed to these compounds spent more time upside down and fanning their wings. They also had longer bouts of standing still. Bees exposed to the nectar toxin, aconitine, and the pyrethroid, allethrin, also spent less time grooming their antennae. We also found that the concentration of the nectar toxin, grayanotoxin I (GTX), fed to bees affected the time spent upside down (i.e., failure to perform the righting reflex). Our data show that low doses of pyrethroids and other nectar toxins that target sodium channels mainly influence motor function through their effect on the righting reflex of adult worker honeybees. © 2015 Oliver et al.		aconitine, allethrin, cyfluthrin, fluvalinate, grayanotoxin I, permethrin, sodium channel, aconitine, cyfluthrin, diterpene, fluvalinate, grayanotoxin I, insecticide, nectar, nitrile, permethrin, pyrethroid, adult, animal behavior, animal experiment, antenna (organ), Apis mellifera, Article, concentration (parameters), controlled study, grooming, LD50, locomotion, motor performance, nectar, nonhuman, wing fanning, animal, animal behavior, bee, drug effects, grooming, physiology, toxicity, wing, Aconitine, Animals, Bees, Behavior, Animal, Diterpenes, Grooming, Insecticides, Locomotion, Nitriles, Permethrin, Plant Nectar, Pyrethrins, Wings, Animal	2015-08-17
Evidence for pollinator cost and farming benefits of neonicotinoid seed coatings on oilseed rape	Chronic exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides has been linked to reduced survival of pollinating insects at both the individual and colony level, but so far only experimentally. Analyses of large-scale datasets to investigate the real-world links between the use of neonicotinoids and pollinator mortality are lacking. Moreover, the impacts of neonicotinoid seed coatings in reducing subsequent applications of foliar insecticide sprays and increasing crop yield are not known, despite the supposed benefits of this practice driving widespread use. Here, we combine large-scale pesticide usage and yield observations from oilseed rape with those detailing honey bee colony losses over an 11 year period, and reveal a correlation between honey bee colony losses and national-scale imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid) usage patterns across England and Wales. We also provide the first evidence that farmers who use neonicotinoid seed coatings reduce the number of subsequent applications of foliar insecticide sprays and may derive an economic return. Our results inform the societal discussion on the pollinator costs and farming benefits of prophylactic neonicotinoid usage on a mass flowering crop.		insecticide, nicotine, agriculture, animal, bee, Brassica rapa, drug effects, economics, England, growth, development and aging, insect control, parasitology, physiology, plant seed, pollination, procedures, Wales, Agriculture, Animals, Bees, Brassica rapa, England, Insect Control, Insecticides, Nicotine, Pollination, Seeds, Wales	2015-08-13
Big brother for bees (3B) - Energy neutral platform for remote monitoring of beehive imagery and sound	Honey bees have played a major role in the history and development of humankind, in particular for nutrition and agriculture. The most important role of the western honey bee (Apis mellifera) is that of pollination. A large amount of crops consumed throughout the world today are pollinated by the activity of the honey bee. It is estimated that the total value of these crops stands at 155 billion euro annually. The goal of the work outlined in this paper was to use wireless sensor network technology to monitor a colony within the beehive with the aim of collecting image and audio data. These data allows the beekeeper to obtain a much more comprehensive view of the in-hive conditions, an indication of flight direction, as well as monitoring the hive outside of the traditional beekeeping times, i.e. during the night, poor weather, and winter months. This paper outlines the design of a fully autonomous beehive monitoring system which provided image and sound monitoring of the internal chambers of the hive, as well as a warning system for emergency events such as possible piping, dramatically increased hive activity, or physical damage to the hive. The final design included three wireless nodes: a digital infrared camera with processing capabilities for collecting imagery of the hive interior; an external thermal imaging camera node for monitoring the colony status and activity, and an accelerometer and a microphone connected to an off the shelf microcontroller node for processing. The system allows complex analysis and sensor fusion. Some scenarios based on sound processing, image collection, and accelerometers are presented. Power management was implemented which allowed the system to achieve energy neutrality in an outdoor deployment with a 525 × 345 mm solar panel. © 2015 IEEE.

Wintering of honey bee colonies in cylindrical nest cavities versus oblong box-hives in a North European climate	We compared the efficacy of wintering honey bee colonies in wooden cylinders and wooden oblong box hives. Five colonies in “cylinders” and three colonies in “box-hives” were compared over two winters. The cylinders were 450 mm high with an internal diameter of 280 mm. The oblong box hives were Estonian standard one-box long hives with a frame size of 414 × 277 mm. Eight vertical rows of thermistors were fixed along the inner walls of both cylinders and hives and temperatures were measured at about weekly intervals. Food consumption and bee mortality of colonies were also assessed. In the cylinders, the winter clusters remained close to their front walls and away from the back wall, especially in cold weather. It was considerably warmer by the inner walls of the cylinders than in the hives, especially in the lower part. The surface of warm area decreased with cold weather and increased at around 0 °C indicating contraction and expansion of the cluster, respectively. In the second half of winter, there was a larger warm area in the cylinders than in the hives indicating that the clusters touched the walls of the cylinder more, thereby reducing heat losses further. Considerably, less food (13.5%) was consumed in the cylinders than in the hives. The numbers of dead bees on the floor was significantly lower in the cylinders than in the hives, but total bee mortality (dead bees on the floor  +  bees flown out in winter) differed little between cylinders and hives. © 2016 International Bee Research Association.			2015-08-08
The presence of varroa in Uganda and knowledge about it by the beekeeping industry	Varroa mites are important honey bee ecto-parasites that have caused disaster to the beekeeping industry in Europe and America. The extent of spread of these mites in Africa is not clearly known, but several sub-Saharan African countries including Uganda have been on the varroa-suspect list. We surveyed 16 districts falling in eight agroecological zones in Uganda with the aim of establishing the presence of varroa mites. Within each district, at least two subcounties were visited for honey bee sample collection and varroa detection between September 2011 and April 2013. Honey bee samples collected were screened for varroa mites by dusting with thymol. Farmers and beekeeping extension workers were interviewed on their knowledge of varroa. The results indicate that varroa mites were present in all the districts and agroecological regions sampled. Bee farmers and beekeeping extension workers were completely unaware of the presence of the varroa mites. The farmers reported no changes in honey production and honey bee foraging. We recommend empirical studies to establish the effects of varroa on local honey bee productivity and the validity of the purported resistance of the African honey bees to varroa. © 2016 International Bee Research Association.			2015-08-08
A national survey of managed honey bee 2014–2015 annual colony losses in the USA	Declines of pollinators and high mortality rates of honey bee colonies are a major concern, both in the USA and globally. Long-term data on summer, winter, and annual colony losses improve our understanding of forces shaping the viability of the pollination industry. Since the mass die-offs of colonies in the USA during the winter of 2006–2007, generally termed “Colony Collapse Disorder” (CCD), annual colony loss surveys have been conducted. These surveys gage colony losses among beekeepers of all operation sizes, recruited to participate via regional beekeeping organizations, phone calls, and postal mail. In the last three years, these surveys include summer and annual losses in addition to winter losses. Winter losses in this most recent survey include 5,937 valid participants (5,690 backyard, 169 sideline, and 78 commercial beekeepers), collectively managing 414,267 colonies on 1 October 2014 and constituting 15.1% of the estimated 2.74 million managed colonies in the USA. Annual losses are typically higher than either winter or summer losses, as they calculate losses over the entire year. Total reported losses were 25.3% [95% CI 24.7–25.9%] over the summer, 22.3% [95% CI 21.9–22.8%] over the winter, and 40.6% [95% CI 40.0–41.2%] for the entire 2014–2015 beekeeping year. Average losses were 14.7% [95% CI 14.0–15.3%] over the summer, 43.7% [95% CI 42.8–44.6%] over the winter, and 49.0% [95% CI 48.1–50.0%] over the entire year. While total winter losses were lower in 2014–2015 than in previous years, summer losses remained high, resulting in total annual colony losses of more than 40% during the survey period. This was the first year that total losses were higher in the summer than in the winter, explained in large part by commercial beekeepers reporting losses of 26.2% of their managed colonies during summer, compared to 20.5% during winter. Self-identified causes of overwintering mortality differed by operation size, with smaller backyard beekeepers generally indicating colony management issues (e.g., starvation, weak colony in the fall), in contrast to commercial beekeepers who typically emphasize parasites or factors outside their control (e.g., varroa, nosema, queen failure). More than two-thirds of all beekeepers (67.3%) had higher colony losses than they deemed acceptable. © 2016 International Bee Research Association.			2015-08-08
Associations among Nosema spp. fungi, Varroa destructor mites, and chemical treatments in honey bees, Apis mellifera	Nosema spp. and Varroa destructor are common parasites of honey bee colonies. Beekeepers routinely treat colonies with the fungicide fumagillin to control Nosema and an array of miticides to control V. destructor. Interactions between these parasites and chemical treatments are poorly understood. We allocated honey bee colonies to distinct chemical treatment regimes and monitored parasite intensities in the subsequent year. Infections of Nosema and infestations of V. destructor were positively correlated. Fumagillin was effective at mitigating Nosema intensities only over the short term, suggesting that biannual application is essential. V. destructor intensities were higher in colonies that had been previously treated with miticides, reasons for this warrant further investigation. © 2016 International Bee Research Association.			2015-08-08
Antiviral defense mechanisms in honey bees	Honey bees are significant pollinators of agricultural crops and other important plant species. High annual losses of honey bee colonies in North America and in some parts of Europe have profound ecological and economic implications. Colony losses have been attributed to multiple factors including RNA viruses, thus understanding bee antiviral defense mechanisms may result in the development of strategies that mitigate colony losses. Honey bee antiviral defense mechanisms include RNA-interference, pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered signal transduction cascades, and reactive oxygen species generation. However, the relative importance of these and other pathways is largely uncharacterized. Herein we review the current understanding of honey bee antiviral defense mechanisms and suggest important avenues for future investigation. © 2015 The Authors.

A Mathematical Model of the Honeybee–Varroa destructor–Acute Bee Paralysis Virus System with Seasonal Effects	A mathematical model for the honeybee–varroa mite–ABPV system is proposed in terms of four differential equations for the: infected and uninfected bees in the colony, number of mites overall, and of mites carrying the virus. To account for seasonal variability, all parameters are time periodic. We obtain linearized stability conditions for the disease-free periodic solutions. Numerically, we illustrate that, for appropriate parameters, mites can establish themselves in colonies that are not treated with varroacides, leading to colonies with slightly reduced number of bees. If some of these mites carry the virus, however, the colony might fail suddenly after several years without a noticeable sign of stress leading up to the failure. The immediate cause of failure is that at the end of fall, colonies are not strong enough to survive the winter in viable numbers. We investigate the effect of the initial disease infestation on collapse time, and how varroacide treatment affects long-term behavior. We find that to control the virus epidemic, the mites as disease vector should be controlled. © 2015, Society for Mathematical Biology.		animal, arachnid vector, bee, biological model, computer simulation, Dicistroviridae, ectoparasitosis, mathematical phenomena, parasitology, pathogenicity, season, Varroidae, veterinary, virology, Animals, Arachnid Vectors, Bees, Computer Simulation, Dicistroviridae, Ectoparasitic Infestations, Mathematical Concepts, Models, Biological, Seasons, Varroidae	2015-08-01
Development and comparison of two multi-residue methods for the analysis of select pesticides in honey bees, pollen, and wax by gas chromatography-quadrupole mass spectrometry	Abstract One of the hypotheses that may help explain the loss of honey bee colonies worldwide is the increasing potential for exposure of honey bees to complex mixtures of pesticides. To better understand this phenomenon, two multi-residue methods based on different extraction and cleanup procedures have been developed, and compared for the determination of 11 relevant pesticides in honey bees, pollen, and wax by gas chromatography-quadrupole mass spectrometry. Sample preparatory methods included solvent extraction followed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) cleanup and cleanup using a dispersive solid-phase extraction with zirconium-based sorbents (Z-Sep). Matrix effects, method detection limits, recoveries, and reproducibility were evaluated and compared. Method detection limits (MDL) of the pesticides for the GPC method in honey bees, pollen, and wax ranged from 0.65 to 5.92 ng/g dw, 0.56 to 6.61 ng/g dw, and 0.40 to 8.30 ng/g dw, respectively, while MDLs for the Z-Sep method were from 0.33 to 4.47 ng/g dw, 0.42 to 5.37 ng/g dw, and 0.51 to 5.34 ng/g dw, respectively. The mean recoveries in all matrices and at three spiking concentrations ranged from 64.4% to 149.5% and 71.9% to 126.2% for the GPC and Z-Sep methods, with relative standard deviation between 1.5-25.3% and 1.3-15.9%, respectively. The results showed that the Z-Sep method was more suitable for the determination of the target pesticides, especially chlorothalonil, in bee hive samples. The Z-Sep method was then validated using a series of field-collected bee hive samples taken from honey bee colonies in Virginia. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Weeds for bees? A review	Agricultural intensification has led to the decrease of the diversity of wild and domestic pollinators. For instance, honeybees declined by 59 % in 61 years in the USA. About 35 % of major crops in the world depend on pollination services, and 3–8 % of world crop production will disappear without pollinators. Indeed, pollination provides several ecosystem services such as enabling crop and honey productions, regulating weeds and other cultural services. Agricultural intensification has also decreased weed diversity by about 50 % in 70 years because massive herbicide sprays have reduced the competition between weeds and crops. Nevertheless, weeds are at the basis of agricultural foodwebs, providing food to many living organisms. In particular, weeds provide flowers for pollinating insects including honey and wild bees. Here, we review the decline of weeds and bees. We discuss the effect of bees and pollination on crop production. We describe the complex interactions between bee pollinators, e.g. honey and wild bees, and landscape habitats such as crop fields and semi-natural elements. For that, we focus on spatial and temporal effects on flower resources. We show that weed abundance can reduce crop yields, thus inducing conflict with farmers. But weed abundance enhances regulating services by ensuring the survival of honeybees in the absence of oil seed crops. Weed abundance also enhances pollination services and, in turn, honey yield for the benefit of beekeepers. Weed abundance has also improved the survival of wild flora and the socio-cultural value of landscapes, a major request from the public. From those findings, we present a conceptual framework allowing to define ecological engineering options based upon ecosystem services of weeds and pollinators. © 2015, INRA and Springer-Verlag France.		abundance, agricultural intensification, agroecology, apiculture, crop yield, ecosystem service, habitat availability, honeybee, pollination, survivorship, sustainable development, weed, United States, Apoidea, Hexapoda	2015-07-26
Pathogens as predictors of honey bee colony strength in England and Wales	Inspectors with the UK National Bee Unit were asked for 2007-2008 to target problem apiaries in England and Wales for pathogen screening and colony strength measures. Healthy colonies were included in the sampling to provide a continuum of health conditions. A total of 406 adult bee samples was screened and yielded 7 viral, 1 bacterial, and 2 microsporidial pathogens and 1 ectoparasite (Acarapis woodi). In addition, 108 samples of brood were screened and yielded 4 honey bee viruses. Virus prevalence varied from common (deformed wing virus, black queen cell virus) to complete absence (Israeli acute paralysis virus). When colonies were forced into one of two classes, strong or weak, the weak colonies contained more pathogens in adult bees. Among observed pathogens, only deformed wing virus was able to predict colony strength. The effect was negative such that colonies testing positive for deformed wing virus were likely to have fewer combs of bees or brood. This study constitutes the first record for Nosema ceranae in Great Britain. These results contribute to the growing body of evidence linking pathogens to poor honey bee health.

Plant-Derived Tick Repellents Activate the Honey Bee Ectoparasitic Mite TRPA1	We have identified and characterized the TRPA1 channel of Varroa destructor (VdTRPA1), a major ectoparasitic mite of honey bee. One of the two VdTRPA1 isoforms, VdTRPA1L, was activated by a variety of plant-derived compounds, including electrophilic compounds, suggesting that chemical activation profiles are mostly shared between arthropod TRPA1 channels. Nevertheless, carvacrol and α-terpineol activated VdTRPA1L but not a honey bee noxious-stimuli-sensitive TRPA, AmHsTRPA, and Drosophila melanogaster TRPA1. Activation of VdTRPA1L in D. melanogaster taste neurons by the above compounds was sufficient to modify the gustatory behaviors. Carvacrol and α-terpineol repelled V. destructor in a laboratory assay, and α-terpineol repressed V. destructor entry for reproduction into the brood cells in hives. Understanding the functions of parasite TRP channels not only gives clues about the evolving molecular and cellular mechanisms of parasitism but also helps in the development of control methods. © 2015 The Authors.		transient receptor potential channel A1, alpha-terpineol, arthropod protein, calcium, carvacrol, cyclohexene derivative, isoprotein, terpene, transient receptor potential channel, amino acid sequence, Article, controlled study, Drosophila melanogaster, ectoparasite, electrophilicity, enzyme activation, expression vector, gene expression profiling, human, human cell, morphology, nonhuman, open reading frame, priority journal, progeny, protein analysis, protein expression, protein function, protein localization, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, sequence alignment, stop codon, Varroa destructor, animal, animal behavior, bee, chemistry, drug effects, gene expression regulation, genetics, HEK293 cell line, insect control, isolation and purification, metabolism, molecular genetics, plant, Varroidae, Acari, Apis mellifera, Arthropoda, Drosophila melanogaster, Ixodida, Varroa destructor, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Arthropod Proteins, Bees, Behavior, Animal, Calcium, Cyclohexenes, Drosophila melanogaster, Gene Expression Regulation, HEK293 Cells, Humans, Insect Control, Molecular Sequence Data, Monoterpenes, Plants, Protein Isoforms, Sequence Alignment, Transient Receptor Potential Channels, Varroidae	2015-07-14
Larval exposure to the juvenile hormone analog pyriproxyfen disrupts acceptance of and social behavior performance in adult honeybees	Background: Juvenile hormone (JH) plays an important role in honeybee development and the regulation of age-related division of labor. However, honeybees can be exposed to insect growth regulators (IGRs), such as JH analogs developed for insect pest and vector control. Although their side effects as endocrine disruptors on honeybee larval or adult stages have been studied, little is known about the subsequent effects on adults of a sublethal larval exposure. We therefore studied the impact of the JH analog pyriproxyfen on larvae and resulting adults within a colony under semi-field conditions by combining recent laboratory larval tests with chemical analysis and behavioral observations. Oral and chronic larval exposure at cumulative doses of 23 or 57 ng per larva were tested. Results: Pyriproxyfen-treated bees emerged earlier than control bees and the highest dose led to a significant rate of malformed adults (atrophied wings). Young pyriproxyfen-treated bees were more frequently rejected by nestmates from the colony, inducing a shorter life span. This could be linked to differences in cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles between control and pyriproxyfen-treated bees. Finally, pyriproxyfen-treated bees exhibited fewer social behaviors (ventilation, brood care, contacts with nestmates or food stocks) than control bees. Conclusion: Larval exposure to sublethal doses of pyriproxyfen affected several life history traits of the honeybees. Our results especially showed changes in social integration (acceptance by nestmates and social behaviors performance) that could potentially affect population growth and balance of the colony. © 2015 Fourrier et al.		hydrocarbon, pyriproxyfen, hydrocarbon, juvenile hormone, pyridine derivative, pyriproxyfen, adult, animal behavior, animal experiment, arthropod larva, Article, chemical analysis, controlled study, exposure, female, food intake, forelimb, honeybee, imago, insect development, integration, life history trait, lifespan, limb malformation, lung ventilation, male, mortality, nonhuman, organism colony, population growth, social behavior, anatomy and histology, animal, bee, drug effects, growth, development and aging, human relation, larva, metabolism, social distance, Animals, Bees, Behavior, Animal, Hydrocarbons, Interpersonal Relations, Juvenile Hormones, Larva, Pyridines, Social Distance	2015-07-14
Differential gene expression between hygienic and non-hygienic honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) hives	Background: Hygienic behavior is a complex, genetically-based quantitative trait that serves as a key defense mechanism against parasites and diseases in Apis mellifera. Yet, the genomic basis and functional pathways involved in the initiation of this behavior are still unclear. Deciphering the genomic basis of hygienic behavior is a prerequisite to developing an extensive repertoire of genetic markers associated to the performance level of this quantitative trait. To fill this knowledge gap, we performed an RNA-seq on brain samples of 25 honeybees per hives from five hygienic and three non-hygienic hives. Results: This analysis revealed that a limited number of functional genes are involved in honeybee hygienic behavior. The genes identified, and especially their location in the honeybee genome, are consistent with previous findings. Indeed, the genomic sequences of most differentially expressed genes were found on the majority of the QTL regions associated to the hygienic behavior described in previous studies. According to the Gene Ontology annotation, 15 genes are linked to the GO-terms DNA or nucleotide binding, indicating a possible role of these genes in transcription regulation. Furthermore, GO-category enrichment analysis revealed that electron carrier activity is over-represented, involving only genes belonging to the cytochrome P450. Cytochrome P450 enzymes' overexpression can be explained by a disturbance in the regulation of expression induced by changes in transcription regulation or sensitivity to xenobiotics. Over-expressed cytochrome P450 enzymes could potentially degrade the odorant pheromones or chemicals that normally signal the presence of a diseased brood before activation of the removal process thereby inhibit hygienic behavior. Conclusions: These findings improve our understanding on the genetics basis of the hygienic behavior. Our results show that hygienic behavior relies on a limited set of genes linked to different regulation patterns (expression level and biological processes) associated with an over-expression of cytochrome P450 genes. © 2015 Boutin et al.		cytochrome P450, DNA, nucleotide, pheromone, xenobiotic agent, cytochrome P450, genetic marker, animal behavior, animal tissue, Apis mellifera, Article, controlled study, degradation, DNA binding, gene expression, gene function, gene identification, gene location, gene ontology, gene overexpression, gene sequence, genetic marker, genomics, honeybee, hygienic behavior, insect genome, nonhuman, protein expression, quantitative trait, RNA sequence, signal transduction, transcription regulation, animal, animal behavior, bee, brain, gene expression regulation, genetic transcription, genetics, metabolism, molecular genetics, procedures, social behavior, Apis mellifera, Animals, Bees, Behavior, Animal, Brain, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, Gene Expression Regulation, Gene Ontology, Genetic Markers, Genome, Insect, Molecular Sequence Annotation, Social Behavior, Transcription, Genetic	2015-07-07
Development of an heterogeneous wireless sensor network for instrumentation and analysis of beehives	Honey bees have held a critical role in agriculture and nutrition from the dawn of human civilisation. The most crucial role of the bee is pollination; the value of pollination dependant crops is estimated at € 155 billion per year with honey bees identified as the most important pollinator insect. It is clear that honey bees are a vitally important part of the environment which cannot be allowed to fall into decline. The project outlined in this paper uses Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology to monitor a beehive colony and collect key information about activity/environment within a beehive as well as its surrounding area. This project uses low power WSN technologies, including novel sensing techniques, energy neutral operation, and multi-radio communications; together with cloud computing to monitor the behaviour within a beehive. The insights gained through this activity could reduce long term costs and improve the yield of beekeeping, as well as providing new scientific evidence for a range of honey bee health issues. WSN is an emerging modern technology, key to the novel concept of the Internet of Things (IoT). Comprised of embedded sensing, computing and wireless communication devices, they have found applications in nearly every aspect of daily life. Informed by biologists' hypotheses, this work used existing, commercially available WSN platforms together with custom built systems in an innovative application to monitor honey bee health and activity in order to better understand how to remotly monitor the health and behaviour of the bees. Heterogeneous sensors were deployed, monitoring the honey bees in the hive (temperature, CO2, pollutants etc.). Weather conditions throughout the deployment were recorded and a relationship between the hive conditions and external conditions was observed. A full solution is presented including a smart hive, communication, and data aggregation and visualisation tools. Future work will focus on improving the energy performance of the system, introducing a more specialised set of sensors, implementing a machine learning algorithm to extract meaning from the data without human supervision; and securing additional deployments of the system. © 2015 IEEE.		3G mobile communication systems, Artificial intelligence, Balloons, Complex networks, Embedded systems, Energy harvesting, Food products, Health, Learning algorithms, Learning systems, Radio communication, Wireless telecommunication systems, Zigbee, 3G mobile communication, External conditions, Heterogeneous sensors, Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks, Internet of thing (IOT), Modern technologies, Scientific evidence, Wireless communication devices, Wireless sensor networks	2015-07-06
Effects of 'inactive' ingredients on bees	Honey bees are sensitive to widespread co-formulants used in agrochemicals, and evaluation of the role of these 'inerts or inactives' in pollinator decline is only in its formative stages. Lack of disclosure of formulation ingredients in major products and lack of adequate methods for their analysis constrain the assessment of total chemical load and agrochemical exposures on bees. Most studies to document pesticide effects on honey bees are performed without the formulation or other relevant spray adjuvant components used to environmentally apply the toxicant. Formulations are generally more toxic than active ingredients, particularly fungicides, by up to 26,000-fold based on published literature. Some 'inactive' candidates for future risk assessment for pollinators include the organosilicone surfactants and the co-solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Weight watching and the effect of landscape on honeybee colony productivity: Investigating the value of colony weight monitoring for the beekeeping industry	Over the last few decades, a gradual departure away from traditional agricultural practices has resulted in alterations to the composition of the countryside and landscapes across Europe. In the face of such changes, monitoring the development and productivity of honey bee colonies from different sites can give valuable insight on the influence of landscape on their productivity and might point towards future directions for modernized beekeeping practices. Using data on honeybee colony weights provided by electronic scales spread across Denmark, we investigated the effect of the immediate landscape on colony productivity. In order to extract meaningful information, data manipulation was necessary prior to analysis as a result of different management regimes or scales malfunction. Once this was carried out, we were able to show that colonies situated in landscapes composed of more than 50% urban areas were significantly more productive than colonies situated in those with more than 50% agricultural areas or those in mixed areas. As well as exploring some of the potential reasons for the observed differences, we discuss the value of weight monitoring of colonies on a large scale.

Detoxification mechanisms of honey bees (Apis mellifera) resulting in tolerance of dietary nicotine	Insecticides are thought to be among the major factors contributing to current declines in bee populations. However, detoxification mechanisms in healthy, unstressed honey bees are poorly characterised. Alkaloids are naturally encountered in pollen and nectar, and we used nicotine as a model compound to identify the mechanisms involved in detoxification processes in honey bees. Nicotine and neonicotinoids have similar modes of action in insects. Our metabolomic and proteomic analyses show active detoxification of nicotine in bees, associated with increased energetic investment and also antioxidant and heat shock responses. The increased energetic investment is significant in view of the interactions of pesticides with diseases such as Nosema spp which cause energetic stress and possible malnutrition. Understanding how healthy honey bees process dietary toxins under unstressed conditions will help clarify how pesticides, alone or in synergy with other stress factors, lead to declines in bee vitality.		branched chain amino acid, cytochrome P450, insect protein, nicotine, pesticide, reactive oxygen metabolite, animal, bee, drug inactivation, drug tolerance, energy metabolism, enzymology, heat shock response, metabolism, oxidative stress, Amino Acids, Branched-Chain, Animals, Bees, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, Drug Tolerance, Energy Metabolism, Heat-Shock Response, Inactivation, Metabolic, Insect Proteins, Nicotine, Oxidative Stress, Pesticides, Reactive Oxygen Species	2015-07-02
The conservation value of urban green space habitats for Australian native bee communities	Networks of urban green space can provide critical resources for wild bees, however it is unclear which attributes of green spaces provide these resources, or how their management can be improved to benefit a diversity of bee species. We examined bee communities in three dominant urban green space habitats: (1) golf courses (2) public parks and (3) front gardens and streetscapes in residential neighbourhoods in Melbourne, Australia and assessed which local and landscape attributes influenced bee communities. There was a greater abundance and richness of bee species in public parks compared to golf courses and residential neighbourhoods, where the latter habitat was dominated by European Honeybees (. Apis mellifera). The occurrence of A. mellifera was positively associated with increases in flowering and native plants. Ground-nesting Homalictus species occurred more frequently in older golf courses and public parks surrounded by low impervious surface cover, and with a low diversity of flowering plants. Cavity nesting, floral specialists within the Colletidae family occurred more often in green space habitats with greater native vegetation, and occurred infrequently in residential neighbourhoods. The lack of appropriate nesting habitat and dominance of exotic flowering plants in residential neighbourhoods appeared to positively impact upon the generalist A. mellifera, but negatively affected cavity and ground nesting floral specialist bee species (e.g. Halictidae and Colletidae). Our results highlight the need to include urban areas in pollinator conservation initiatives, as providing resources critical to diverse bee communities can assist in maintaining these key pollinators in urban landscapes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.		conservation management, generalist, greenspace, honeybee, native species, neighborhood, nesting, pollinator, resource allocation, species diversity, wild population, Australia, Melbourne, Victoria [Australia], Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Colletidae, Halictidae, Homalictus, Magnoliophyta	2015-07-01
Consequences of Nosema apis infection for male honey bees and their fertility	The queens of eusocial bees, ants and wasps mate only during a very short period early in life and males therefore produce ejaculates consisting of large numbers of high quality sperm. Such extreme selection for high fecundity resulted in males investing minimally into their somatic survival, including their immune system. However, if susceptible males are unable to protect their reproductive tissue from infections, they compromise queen fitness if they transfer pathogens during mating. We used the honey bee Apis mellifera and investigated the course of infection of the sexually transmitted pathogen Nosema apis. We predicted that honey bee males are susceptible but protect their reproductive tissues from infections. We investigated the effects of N. apis infections on the midgut, the accessory glands and the accessory testes and quantified the consequences of infection on male survival and fecundity. We found that N. apis is able to infect males, and as infections progressed, it significantly impacted fertility and survival in older males. Even though we confirm males to be able to minimize N. apis infections of their reproductive tissues, the parasite is present in ejaculates of older males. Consequently N. apis evolved alternative routes to successfully infect ejaculates and get sexually transmitted.		fungal DNA, microsatellite DNA, animal, bee, fertility, fungus spore, genetics, intestine, isolation and purification, male, metabolism, microbiology, microscopy, Nosema, pathology, physiology, polymerase chain reaction, spermatozoon, testis, Animals, Bees, DNA, Fungal, Fertility, Intestines, Male, Microsatellite Repeats, Microscopy, Nosema, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Spermatozoa, Spores, Fungal, Testis	2015-06-30
Effects of realistic doses of atrazine, metolachlor, and glyphosate on lipid peroxidation and diet-derived antioxidants in caged honey bees (Apis mellifera)	The decline in the population of pollinators is a worrying phenomenon worldwide. In North America, the extensive use of herbicides in maize and soya crops may affect the health of nontarget organisms like the honey bee. In this study, caged honey bees were exposed to realistic doses of atrazine, metolachlor, and glyphosate for 10 days via contaminated syrup. Peroxidation of lipids was evaluated using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) test, and diet-derived antioxidants—carotenoids, all-trans-retinol (at-ROH) and α-tocopherol—were detected and quantified using reversed-phase HPLC techniques. Significant increases in syrup consumption were observed in honey bees exposed to metolachlor, and a lower TBARS value was recorded for the highest dose. No relationship was observed between the peroxidation of lipids and the levels of antioxidants. However, β-carotene, which was found to be the most abundant carotenoid, and at-ROH (derived from β-carotene) both decreased with increasing doses of atrazine and glyphosate. In contrast, metolachlor increased levels of at-ROH without any effects on β-carotene. These results show that the honey bee carotenoid–retinoid system may be altered by sublethal field-realistic doses of herbicides. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

RNAi Technology for Insect Management and Protection of Beneficial Insects from Diseases: Lessons, Challenges and Risk Assessments	The time has passed for us to wonder whether RNA interference (RNAi) effectively controls pest insects or protects beneficial insects from diseases. The RNAi era in insect science began with studies of gene function and genetics that paved the way for the development of novel and highly specific approaches for the management of pest insects and, more recently, for the treatment and prevention of diseases in beneficial insects. The slight differences in components of RNAi pathways are sufficient to provide a high degree of variation in responsiveness among insects. The current framework to assess the negative effects of genetically modified (GM) plants on human health is adequate for RNAi-based GM plants. Because of the mode of action of RNAi and the lack of genomic data for most exposed non-target organisms, it becomes difficult to determine the environmental risks posed by RNAi-based technologies and the benefits provided for the protection of crops. A better understanding of the mechanisms that determine the variability in the sensitivity of insects would accelerate the worldwide release of commercial RNAi-based approaches. © 2015, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.

Overwintering honey bees: biology and management	In temperate climates, honey bees (Apis mellifera) survive the winter by entering a distinct physiological and behavioral state. In recent years, beekeepers are reporting unsustainably high colony losses during the winter, which have been linked to parasitization by Varroa mites, virus infections, geographic location, and variation across honey bee genotypes. Here, we review literature on environmental, physiological, and social factors regulating entrance, maintenance, and exit from the overwintering state in honey bees in temperate regions and develop a testable model to explain how multiple factors may be acting synergistically to regulate this complex transition. We also review existing knowledge of the factors affecting overwintering survival in honey bees and providing suggestions to beekeepers aiming to improve their colonies' overwintering success. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

B+WSN: Smart beehive for agriculture, environmental, and honey bee health monitoring - Preliminary results and analysis	In recent years, various United Nations reports have stressed the growing constraint of food supply for Earth's growing human population. Honey bees are a vital part of the food chain as the most important pollinator insect for a wide range of crops. It is clear that protecting the population of honey bees worldwide, as well as enabling them to maximise their productivity, is an important concern. The work described in this paper utilised heterogeneous wireless sensor networks technologies to gather data unobtrusively from a beehive, describing the conditions and activity of the honey bee colony. A wide range of sensors were deployed for monitoring the multidimensional conditions within a living beehive (including oxygen, carbon dioxide, pollutant levels, temperature, and humidity). Meteorological and environmental conditions outside the hive were also monitored throughout the deployment. The data were then analysed from a biological perspective to provide insights into honey bee behaviour and health. This led to the development of an algorithm for automatically determining the status of the bee colony. Analysis was also undertaken from a meteorological perspective, which led to the development of an algorithm for predicting short term external weather conditions (rain) based on the conditions observed within the hive. The meteorological conditions were seen to have an impact on the data provided by biological sensors (bees) and physical sensors. This can be exploited to improve the accuracy of local weather prediction. Applications of this algorithm include agricultural and environmental monitoring for accurate short term forecasts for the area local to the beehive. © 2015 IEEE.

Honey bee infecting Lake Sinai viruses	Honey bees are critical pollinators of important agricultural crops. Recently, high annual losses of honey bee colonies have prompted further investigation of honey bee infecting viruses. To better characterize the recently discovered and very prevalent Lake Sinai virus (LSV) group, we sequenced currently circulating LSVs, performed phylogenetic analysis, and obtained images of LSV2. Sequence analysis resulted in extension of the LSV1 and LSV2 genomes, the first detection of LSV4 in the US, and the discovery of LSV6 and LSV7. We detected LSV1 and LSV2 in the Varroa destructor mite, and determined that a large proportion of LSV2 is found in the honey bee gut, suggesting that vector-mediated, food-associated, and/or fecal-oral routes may be important for LSV dissemination. Pathogen-specific quantitative PCR data, obtained from samples collected during a small-scale monitoring project, revealed that LSV2, LSV1, Black queen cell virus (BQCV), and Nosema ceranae were more abundant in weak colonies than strong colonies within this sample cohort. Together, these results enhance our current understanding of LSVs and illustrate the importance of future studies aimed at investigating the role of LSVs and other pathogens on honey bee health at both the individual and colony levels. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.		capsid protein, viral protein, virus RNA, Apis mellifera, Article, DNA synthesis, honeybee, mass spectrometry, nonhuman, phylogeny, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, polymerase chain reaction, reverse transcription, RNA isolation, sequence analysis, transmission electron microscopy, ultracentrifugation, virus infection, virus isolation, animal, bee, chemistry, cluster analysis, DNA sequence, genetics, isolation and purification, microbiology, Nosema, RNA virus, sequence homology, ultrastructure, Varroidae, virion, virology, Acari, Apis mellifera, Black queen cell virus, Lily symptomless virus, Nosema ceranae, Varroa destructor, Animals, Bees, Cluster Analysis, Microscopy, Electron, Transmission, Nosema, Phylogeny, RNA Viruses, RNA, Viral, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Sequence Homology, Varroidae, Viral Proteins, Virion	2015-06-23
The effect of oral administration of dsRNA on viral replication and mortality in Bombus terrestris	Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), a single-stranded RNA virus, has a worldwide distribution and affects honeybees as well as other important pollinators. IAPV infection in honeybees has been successfully repressed by exploiting the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway of the insect’s innate immune response with virus-specific double stranded RNA (dsRNA). Here we investigated the effect of IAPV infection in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris and its tissue tropism. B. terrestris is a common pollinator of wild flowers in Europe and is used for biological pollination in agriculture. Infection experiments demonstrated a similar pathology and tissue tropism in bumblebees as reported for honeybees. The effect of oral administration of virus-specific dsRNA was examined and resulted in an effective silencing of the virus, irrespective of the length. Interestingly, we observed that non-specific dsRNA was also efficient against IAPV. However further study is needed to clarify the precise mechanism behind this effect. Finally we believe that our data are indicative of the possibility to use dsRNA for a broad range viral protection in bumblebees. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.		double stranded RNA, antivirus agent, double stranded RNA, Article, Bombus terrestris, concentration (parameters), controlled study, innate immunity, Israeli acute paralysis virus, mortality, nonhuman, real time polymerase chain reaction, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, scoring system, transmission electron microscopy, virus cell interaction, virus detection, virus genome, virus infectivity, virus load, virus particle, virus replication, animal, bee, drug effects, oral drug administration, physiology, RNA virus, treatment outcome, viral tropism, virology, virus replication, Acute bee paralysis virus, Bombus terrestris, RNA viruses, Administration, Oral, Animals, Antiviral Agents, Bees, RNA Viruses, RNA, Double-Stranded, Treatment Outcome, Viral Tropism, Virus Replication	2015-06-18
A review of the direct and indirect effects of neonicotinoids and fipronil on vertebrate wildlife	Concerns over the role of pesticides affecting vertebrate wildlife populations have recently focussed on systemic products which exert broad-spectrum toxicity. Given that the neonicotinoids have become the fastest-growing class of insecticides globally, we review here 150 studies of their direct (toxic) and indirect (e.g. food chain) effects on vertebrate wildlife—mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles. We focus on two neonicotinoids, imidacloprid and clothianidin, and a third insecticide, fipronil, which also acts in the same systemic manner. Imidacloprid and fipronil were found to be toxic to many birds and most fish, respectively. All three insecticides exert sub-lethal effects, ranging from genotoxic and cytotoxic effects, and impaired immune function, to reduced growth and reproductive success, often at concentrations well below those associated with mortality. Use of imidacloprid and clothianidin as seed treatments on some crops poses risks to small birds, and ingestion of even a few treated seeds could cause mortality or reproductive impairment to sensitive bird species. In contrast, environmental concentrations of imidacloprid and clothianidin appear to be at levels below those which will cause mortality to freshwater vertebrates, although sub-lethal effects may occur. Some recorded environmental concentrations of fipronil, however, may be sufficiently high to harm fish. Indirect effects are rarely considered in risk assessment processes and there is a paucity of data, despite the potential to exert population-level effects. Our research revealed two field case studies of indirect effects. In one, reductions in invertebrate prey from both imidacloprid and fipronil uses led to impaired growth in a fish species, and in another, reductions in populations in two lizard species were linked to effects of fipronil on termite prey. Evidence presented here suggests that the systemic insecticides, neonicotinoids and fipronil, are capable of exerting direct and indirect effects on terrestrial and aquatic vertebrate wildlife, thus warranting further review of their environmental safety. © The Author(s) 2014.		bioaccumulation, environmental degradation, growth response, immune response, mortality risk, pesticide, population structure, vertebrate, Amphibia, Aves, Invertebrata, Isoptera, Mammalia, Reptilia, Squamata, Vertebrata, fipronil, imidacloprid, imidazole derivative, insecticide, nicotinic agent, nitro derivative, pollutant, pyrazole derivative, animal, drug effects, food chain, pollutant, reproduction, risk assessment, toxicity, Animals, Environmental Pollutants, Food Chain, Imidazoles, Insecticides, Nicotinic Agonists, Nitro Compounds, Pyrazoles, Reproduction, Risk Assessment	2015-06-18
Effects of genotype, environment, and their interactions on honey bee health in Europe	There are several reports of honey bee populations in Europe which survive without treatment for Varroa. However, when evaluated outside their native area, higher survival and resistance traits were not observed in colonies of a survivor population. Varroa infestation is strongly influenced by environmental factors, probably affecting threshold levels on a European scale. In a Europe-wide experiment colonies of local origin survived significantly longer than colonies of non-local origin, clearly indicating the presence of genotype-environment interactions. Transmission by Varroa selects for virulent strains of DWV, but it is currently unknown how these may interact with different genotypes of bees. The distribution of Nosema ceranae is significantly affected by environment, but there is at least one Nosema-resistant population. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Nutrition, immunity and viral infections in honey bees	Viruses and other pathogens can spread rapidly in social insect colonies from close contacts among nestmates, food sharing and periods of confinement. Here we discuss how honey bees decrease the risk of disease outbreaks by a combination of behaviors (social immunity) and individual immune function. There is a relationship between the effectiveness of social and individual immunity and the nutritional state of the colony. Parasitic Varroa mites undermine the relationship because they reduce nutrient levels, suppress individual immune function and transmit viruses. Future research directions to better understand the dynamics of the nutrition-immunity relationship based on levels of stress, time of year and colony demographics are discussed. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Improving the future of honey bee breeding programs by employing recent scientific advances	A recent abundance of studies investigating causes of honey bee (Apis mellifera) colony losses has led to enhanced recommendations in management practices with particular emphasis on breeding for resistant bee stocks. Here we review the latest advances in research which could improve the future of breeding programs. We discuss diversity in colonies particularly in breeding programs, giving special emphasis to recent improvement in cryopreservation of honey bee germplasm. We also review factors that affect the health and reproductive quality of queens and drones. We briefly discuss how techniques developed by scientists are finding more regular usage with breeders in the assessment of reproductive caste health and quality and in determining best management practices for breeding programs. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

The power and promise of applying genomics to honey bee health	New genomic tools and resources are now being used to both understand honey bee health and develop tools to better manage it. Here, we describe the use of genomic approaches to identify and characterize bee parasites and pathogens, examine interactions among these parasites and pathogens, between them and their bee hosts, and to identify genetic markers for improved breeding of more resilient bee stocks. We also discuss several new genomic techniques that can be used to more efficiently study, monitor and improve bee health. In the case of using RNAi-based technologies to mitigate diseases in bee populations, we highlight advantages, disadvantages and strategies to reduce risk. The increased use of genomic analytical tools and manipulative technologies has already led to significant advances, and holds great promise for improvements in the health of honey bees and other crucial pollinator species. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Pesticides and pollinators: a context-sensitive policy approach	I examine recent policymaking efforts in the United States (US) that seek to improve how risks posed by pesticides to insect pollinators are assessed and managed. Utilizing the case of ongoing honey bee die-offs, I argue for a context-sensitive policy framework. From a scientific perspective, this entails not ignoring the uncertain knowledge emerging from laboratory and field studies regarding the indirect effects of low levels of certain insecticides in combination with other factors. From a social scientific perspective, policy initiatives to build partnerships between growers and beekeepers toward mitigating exposure to pesticides are crucial, and need to acknowledge barriers to the adoption of best management practices as well as a historically-established asymmetry between growers and beekeepers in the pollination industry. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Bee nutrition and floral resource restoration	Bee-population declines are linked to nutritional shortages caused by land-use intensification, which reduces diversity and abundance of host-plant species. Bees require nectar and pollen floral resources that provide necessary carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and micronutrients for survival, reproduction, and resilience to stress. However, nectar and pollen nutritional quality varies widely among host-plant species, which in turn influences how bees forage to obtain their nutritionally appropriate diets. Unfortunately, we know little about the nutritional requirements of different bee species. Research must be conducted on bee species nutritional needs and host-plant species resource quality to develop diverse and nutritionally balanced plant communities. Restoring appropriate suites of plant species to landscapes can support diverse bee species populations and their associated pollination ecosystem services. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.		Apoidea	2015-06-11
Characterization of trisiloxane surfactants from agrochemical adjuvants and pollinator-related matrices using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry	Trisiloxane surfactants (TSSs) have been associated with honeybee learning impairment and the ongoing global bee decline. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry strategy for the identification of TSSs from agrochemical adjuvants and pollinator-related matrices is introduced here. The strategy incorporates chromatographic retention behavior, isotope ratio, reference to a compiled database of accurate masses, and TSS hydrolysis when necessary. Using this analytical strategy, three TSSs (x = 0, R = H, m = 1, 2, or 3) were identified for the first time from almond flowers of a commercial orchard. The three major purified TSS components in popularly used spray tank adjuvants were identified as TSS (x = 0, m = 0, R = H, CH3, or C(O)CH3) and their structures confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These monitoring tools allow the assessment of the agricultural residues and potential risks of major TSS contaminants to important nontarget species such as honeybee and other essential pollinators. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

Negative effects of pesticides on wild bee communities can be buffered by landscape context	Wild bee communities provide underappreciated but critical agricultural pollination services. Given predicted global shortages in pollination services, managing agroecosystems to support thriving wild bee communities is, therefore, central to ensuring sustainable food production. Benefits of natural (including semi-natural) habitat for wild bee abundance and diversity on farms are well documented. By contrast, few studies have examined toxicity of pesticides on wild bees, let alone effects of farm-level pesticide exposure on entire bee communities. Whether beneficial natural areas could mediate effects of harmful pesticides on wild bees is also unknown. Here, we assess the effect of conventional pesticide use on the wild bee community visiting apple (Malus domestica) within a gradient of percentage natural area in the landscape. Wild bee community abundance and species richness decreased linearly with increasing pesticide use in orchards one year after application; however, pesticide effects on wild beeswere buffered by increasing proportion of natural habitat in the surrounding landscape. A significant contribution of fungicides to observed pesticide effects suggests deleterious properties of a class of pesticides that was, until recently, considered benign to bees. Our results demonstrate extended benefits of natural areas for wild pollinators and highlight the importance of considering the landscape context when weighing up the costs of pest management on crop pollination services. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The complicated story of colony losses and pesticides	The news is filled with reports on the dangers of pesticides, especially neonicotinoids, to honey bee health.

Honey bee diet in intensive farmland habitats reveals an unexpectedly high flower richness and a major role of weeds	In intensive farmland habitats, pollination of wild flowers and crops may be threatened by the widespread decline of pollinators. The honey bee decline, in particular, appears to result from the combination of multiple stresses, including diseases, pathogens, and pesticides. The reduction of semi-natural habitats is also suspected to entail floral resource scarcity for bees. Yet, the seasonal dynamics and composition of the honey bee diet remains poorly documented to date. In this study, we studied the seasonal contribution of massflowering crops (rapeseed and sunflower) vs. other floral resources, as well as the influence of nutritional quality and landscape composition on pollen diet composition over five consecutive years. From April to October, the mass of pollen and nectar collected by honey bees followed a bimodal seasonal trend, marked by a two-month period of low food supply between the two oilseed crop mass-flowerings (ending in May for rapeseed and July for sunflower). Bees collected nectar mainly from crops while pollen came from a wide diversity of herbaceous and woody plant species in semi-natural habitats or from weeds in crops. Weed species constituted the bulk of the honey bee diet between the mass flowering crop periods (up to 40%) and are therefore suspected to play a critical role at this time period. The pollen diet composition was related to the nutritional value of the collected pollen and by the local landscape composition. Our study highlights (1) a food supply depletion period of both pollen and nectar resources during late spring, contemporaneously with the demographic peak of honey bee populations, (2) a high botanical richness of pollen diet, mostly proceeding from trees and weeds, and (3) a pollen diet composition influenced by the local landscape composition. Our results therefore support the Agri-Environmental Schemes intended to promote honey bees and beekeeping sustainability through the enhancement of flower availability in agricultural landscapes. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.		agri-environmental policy, agricultural land, apiculture, dicotyledon, diet, flower, food supply, honeybee, nutritive value, palynology, pollen, population decline, seasonal variation, sustainability, weed, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Brassica napus, Helianthus, nectar, agriculture, animal, bee, chemistry, classification, diet, ecosystem, flower, nectar, physiology, pollen, time, weed, Agriculture, Animals, Bees, Diet, Ecosystem, Flowers, Plant Nectar, Plant Weeds, Pollen, Time Factors	2015-06-01
Colonies of bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) produce fewer workers, less bee biomass, and have smaller mother queens following fungicide exposure	Bees provide vital pollination services to the majority of flowering plants in both natural and agricultural systems. Unfortunately, both native and managed bee populations are experiencing declines, threatening the persistence of these plants and crops. Agricultural chemicals are one possible culprit contributing to bee declines. Even fungicides, generally considered safe for bees, have been shown to disrupt honey bee development and impair bumble bee behavior. Little is known, however, how fungicides may affect bumble bee colony growth. We conducted a controlled cage study to determine the effects of fungicide exposure on colonies of a native bumble bee species (Bombus impatiens). Colonies of B. impatiens were exposed to flowers treated with field-relevant levels of the fungicide chlorothalonil over the course of one month. Colony success was assessed by the number and biomass of larvae, pupae, and adult bumble bees. Bumble bee colonies exposed to fungicide produced fewer workers, lower total bee biomass, and had lighter mother queens than control colonies. Our results suggest that fungicides negatively affect the colony success of a native bumble bee species and that the use of fungicides during bloom has the potential to severely impact the success of native bumble bee populations foraging in agroecosystems. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Dynamics of Apis mellifera filamentous virus (AmFV) infections in honey bees and relationships with other parasites	Apis mellifera filamentous virus (AmFV) is a large double stranded DNA virus of honey bees, but its relationship with other parasites and prevalence are poorly known. We analyzed individual honey bees from three colonies at different times post emergence in order to monitor the dynamics of the AmFV gut colonization under natural conditions.Prevalence and loads of microsporidia and trypanosomes were also recorded, as well as five common honey bee RNA viruses. The results show that a high proportion of bees get infected with AmFV during the first week post-emergence (75%) and that AmFV DNA levels remained constant. A similar pattern was observed for microsporidia while trypanosomes seem to require more time to colonize the gut. No significant associations between these three infections were found, but significant positive correlations were observed between AmFV and RNA viruses. In parallel, the prevalence of AmFV in France and Sweden was assessed from pooled honey bee workers. The data indicate that AmFV is almost ubiquitous, and does not seem to follow seasonal patterns, although higher viral loads were significantly detected in spring. A high prevalence of AmFV was also found in winter bees, without obvious impact on overwintering of the colonies. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.		adult, animal experiment, animal tissue, Apis mellifera, Apis mellifera filamentous virus, Article, controlled study, DNA extraction, double-stranded DNA virus, gene dosage, microbial colonization, Microsporidia, nonhuman, Nosema ceranae, parasite, polymerase chain reaction, prevalence, RNA virus, spring, Trypanosoma, virus infection, virus load, animal, bee, France, gastrointestinal tract, growth, development and aging, isolation and purification, Sweden, time factor, virology, Apis mellifera, Apis mellifera ligustica, Apoidea, DNA viruses, Microsporidia, RNA viruses, DNA virus, Animals, Bees, DNA Viruses, France, Gastrointestinal Tract, Microsporidia, RNA Viruses, Sweden, Time Factors, Trypanosoma	2015-05-22
Antennae hold a key to Varroa-sensitive hygiene behaviour in honey bees	In honey bees, Varroa sensitive hygiene (VSH) behaviour, which involves the detection and removal of brood parasitised by the mite Varroa destructor, can actively participate in the survival of colonies facing Varroa outbreaks. This study investigated the mechanisms of VSH behaviour, by comparing the antennal transcriptomes of bees that do and do not perform VSH behaviour. Results indicate that antennae likely play a key role in the expression of VSH behaviour. Comparisons with the antennal transcriptome of nurse and forager bees suggest that VSH profile is more similar to that of nurse bees than foragers. Enhanced detection of certain odorants in VSH bees may be predicted from transcriptional patterns, as well as a higher metabolism and antennal motor activity. Interestingly, Deformed wing virus/Varroa destructor virus infections were detected in the antennae, with higher level in non-VSH bees; a putative negative impact of viral infection on bees' ability to display VSH behaviour is proposed. These results bring new perspectives to the understanding of VSH behaviour and the evolution of collective defence by focusing attention on the importance of the peripheral nervous system. In addition, such data might be useful for promoting marker-assisted selection of honey bees that can survive Varroa infestations.		fragrance, RNA, transcriptome, animal, animal behavior, antenna (organ), bee, host parasite interaction, isolation and purification, metabolism, parasitology, physiology, sequence analysis, Varroidae, Animals, Arthropod Antennae, Bees, Behavior, Animal, Host-Parasite Interactions, Odorants, RNA, Sequence Analysis, RNA, Transcriptome, Varroidae	2015-05-22
Exploiting the architecture and the features of the microsporidian genomes to investigate diversity and impact of these parasites on ecosystems	Fungal species play extremely important roles in ecosystems. Clustered at the base of the fungal kingdom are Microsporidia, a group of obligate intracellular eukaryotes infecting multiple animal lineages. Because of their large host spectrum and their implications in host population regulation, they influence food webs, and accordingly, ecosystem structure and function. Unfortunately, their ecological role is not well understood. Present also as highly resistant spores in the environment, their characterisation requires special attention. Different techniques based on direct isolation andor molecular approaches can be considered to elucidate their role in the ecosystems, but integrating environmental and genomic data (for example, genome architecture, core genome, transcriptional and translational signals) is crucial to better understand the diversity and adaptive capacities of Microsporidia. Here, we review the current status of Microsporidia in trophic networks; the various genomics tools that could be used to ensure identification and evaluate diversity and abundance of these organisms; and how these tools could be used to explore the microsporidian life cycle in different environments. Our understanding of the evolution of these widespread parasites is currently impaired by limited sampling, and we have no doubt witnessed but a small subset of their diversity. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The bacterium frischella perrara causes scab formation in the gut of its honeybee host	Honeybees harbor well-defined bacterial communities in their guts. The major members of these communities appear to benefit the host, but little is known about how they interact with the host and specifically how they interface with the host immune system. In the pylorus, a short region between the midgut and hindgut, honeybees frequently exhibit scab-like structures on the epithelial gut surface. These structures are reminiscent of a melanization response of the insect immune system. Despite the wide distribution of this phenotype in honeybee populations, its cause has remained elusive. Here, we show that the presence of a common member of the bee gut microbiota, the gammaproteobacterium Frischella perrara, correlates with the appearance of the scab phenotype. Bacterial colonization precedes scab formation, and F. perrara specifically localizes to the melanized regions of the host epithelium. Under controlled laboratory conditions, we demonstrate that exposure of microbiotafree bees to F. perrara but not to other bacteria results in scab formation. This shows that F. perrara can become established in a spatially restricted niche in the gut and triggers a morphological change of the epithelial surface, potentially due to a host immune response. As an intermittent colonizer, this bacterium holds promise for addressing questions of community invasion in a simple yet relevant model system. Moreover, our results show that gut symbionts of bees engage in differential host interactions that are likely to affect gut homeostasis.

Neonicotinoid-coated Zea mays seeds indirectly affect honeybee performance and pathogen susceptibility in field trials	Thirty-two honeybee (Apis mellifera) colonies were studied in order to detect and measure potential in vivo effects of neonicotinoid pesticides used in cornfields (Zea mays spp) on honeybee health. Honeybee colonies were randomly split on four different agricultural cornfield areas located near Quebec City, Canada. Two locations contained cornfields treated with a seed-coated systemic neonicotinoid insecticide while the two others were organic cornfields used as control treatments. Hives were extensively monitored for their performance and health traits over a period of two years. Honeybee viruses (brood queen cell virus BQCV, deformed wing virus DWV, and Israeli acute paralysis virus IAPV) and the brain specific expression of a biomarker of host physiological stress, the Acetylcholinesterase gene AChE, were investigated using RT-qPCR. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed to detect pesticide residues in adult bees, honey, pollen, and corn flowers collected from the studied hives in each location. In addition, general hive conditions were assessed by monitoring colony weight and brood development. Neonicotinoids were only identified in corn flowers at low concentrations. However, honeybee colonies located in neonicotinoid treated cornfields expressed significantly higher pathogen infection than those located in untreated cornfields. AChE levels showed elevated levels among honeybees that collected corn pollen from treated fields. Positive correlations were recorded between pathogens and the treated locations. Our data suggests that neonicotinoids indirectly weaken honeybee health by inducing physiological stress and increasing pathogen loads. © 2015 Alburaki et al.

Xenobiotic detoxification pathways in honey bees	Relative to most other insect genomes, the western honey bee Apis mellifera has a deficit of detoxification genes spanning Phase I (functionalization), II (conjugation) and III (excretion) gene families. Although honeybees do not display across-the-board greater sensitivity to pesticides, this deficit may render them vulnerable to synergistic interactions among xenobiotics. Diet quality, in terms of protein and phytochemical content, has a pronounced influence on tolerance of toxic compounds. Detoxification gene inventory reduction may reflect an evolutionary history of consuming relatively chemically benign nectar and pollen, as other apoid pollinators display comparable levels of cytochrome P450 gene reduction. Enzymatic detoxification in the eusocial A. mellifera may be complemented by behaviors comprising a 'social detoxification system,' including forager discrimination, dilution by pollen mixing, and colony food processing via microbial fermentation, that reduces the number or quantity of ingested chemicals requiring detoxification. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

QuEChERS adaptability for the analysis of pesticide residues in beehive products seeking the development of an agroecosystem sustainability monitor	Beehive products could be powerful monitors of pesticide residues originating in agroecosystems during production cycles. Their ready availability provides enough samples to perform analytical determinations, but their chemical complexity makes residue analysis a real challenge. Taking advantage of the plasticity of QuEChERS coupled to LC-MS/MS, validated methodologies were developed for bees, honey, beeswax, and pollen and applied to real samples for the simultaneous determination of 19 of the most employed pesticides in intensive cropping fields. Beehives placed in Uruguayan agroecosystems accumulated the pesticides thiacloprid, imidacloprid, methomyl, carbaryl, hexythiazox, azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, tebuconazole, and haloxyfop-methyl at 0.0001-0.01 mg/kg levels. The oscillations on the amount and occurrence of residue findings for specific apiaries were correlated statistically with the sampling season and the agroecosystem where the beehives were located, showing the potential of bees and bee products to record relevant information to survey the chemicals applied in their surroundings. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

Occurrence, detection, and quantification of economically important viruses in healthy and unhealthy honey bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) colonies in Canada	The occurrence, quantification, and distribution patterns of deformed wing virus (DWV) and sacbrood virus (SBV), (family Iflaviridae); black queen cell virus (BQCV), Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), Kashmir bee virus (KBV), and acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) (family Dicistroviridae), and chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) (unclassified), were characterised in 80 "healthy" honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus; Hymenoptera: Apidae) colonies and 23 "unhealthy" colonies by employing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for virus identification and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for quantification. All seven viruses were common but the most prevalent viruses were DWV, followed by BQCV and IAPV. For most viruses, prevalence in surviving but unhealthy colonies in spring did not differ from that of healthy baseline colony levels in fall suggesting spring prevalence level would not be a useful metric for diagnosis of factors contributing to colony loss. Sacbrood virus was the only virus that was more prevalent in unhealthy colonies from Manitoba, Canada than in healthy from colonies across Canada but did not differ from healthy colonies within Manitoba. Multiple infections were ubiquitous with a few colonies having simultaneous infection with as many as five viruses. Among the three viruses quantified by qPCR, DWV had the highest relative concentrations in pooled samples of worker bees. Deformed wing virus was the only virus within healthy colonies that differed in fall concentration among provinces and was at high levels in unhealthy colonies. Black queen cell virus was positively correlated with IAPV across all samples. Our study provides the first major baseline study of viruses in Canadian honey bees. © Entomological Society of Canada 2015.

Nosema ceranae can infect honey bee larvae and reduces subsequent adult longevity	Nosema ceranae causes a widespread disease that reduces honey bee health but is only thought to infect adult honey bees, not larvae, a critical life stage. We reared honey bee (Apis mellifera) larvae in vitro and provide the first demonstration that N. ceranae can infect larvae and decrease subsequent adult longevity. We exposed three-day-old larvae to a single dose of 40,000 (40K), 10,000 (10K), zero (control), or 40K autoclaved (control) N. ceranae spores in larval food. Spores developed intracellularly in midgut cells at the pre-pupal stage (8 days after egg hatching) of 41% of bees exposed as larvae. We counted the number of N. ceranae spores in dissected bee midguts of pre-pupae and, in a separate group, upon adult death. Pre-pupae exposed to the 10K or 40K spore treatments as larvae had significantly elevated spore counts as compared to controls. Adults exposed as larvae had significantly elevated spore counts as compared to controls. Larval spore exposure decreased longevity: a 40K treatment decreased the age by which 75% of adult bees died by 28%. Unexpectedly, the low dose (10K) led to significantly greater infection (1.3 fold more spores and 1.5 fold more infected bees) than the high dose (40K) upon adult death. Differential immune activation may be involved if the higher dose triggered a stronger larval immune response that resulted in fewer adult spores but imposed a cost, reducing lifespan. The impact of N. ceranae on honey bee larval development and the larvae of naturally infected colonies therefore deserve further study. © 2015 Eiri et al.

Pesticides for apicultural and/or agricultural application found in Belgian honey bee wax combs	In a Belgian pilot study honey bee wax combs from ten hives were analyzed on the presence of almost 300 organochlorine and organophosphorous compounds by LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS. Traces of 18 pesticides were found and not a single sample was free of residues. The number of residues found per sample ranged from 3 to 13, and the pesticides found could be categorized as (1) pesticides for solely apicultural (veterinary) application, (2) pesticides for solely agricultural (crop protection) application, (3) pesticides for mixed agricultural and apicultural (veterinary) application. The frequencies and quantities of some environmental pollutants bear us high concerns. Most alarming was the detection of lindane (gamma-HCH) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (including its breakdown product dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene), two insecticides that are banned in Europe. The present comprehensive residue analysis, however, also reveals residues of pesticides never found in beeswax before, i.e. DEET, propargite and bromophos. © The Author(s) 2015		Agriculture, Food products, Insecticides, Waxes, Beeswax, Breakdown products, Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, Environmental pollutants, Honey bee, Organophosphorous compounds, Residue analysis, Residues, Pesticides, chlorinated hydrocarbon, insecticide, lindane, pesticide, pollutant, propolis, wax, agriculture, analysis, animal, bee, Belgium, environmental monitoring, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, pilot study, pollutant, tandem mass spectrometry, Agriculture, Animals, Bees, Belgium, Chromatography, Liquid, Environmental Monitoring, Environmental Pollutants, Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated, Insecticides, Lindane, Mass Spectrometry, Pesticides, Pilot Projects, Tandem Mass Spectrometry, Waxes	2015-05-01
Characterization of gut bacteria at different developmental stages of Asian honey bees, Apis cerana	Previous surveys have shown that adult workers of the Asian honey bee Apis cerana harbor four major gut microbes (. Bifidobacterium, Snodgrassella alvi, Gilliamella apicola, and Lactobacillus). Using quantitative PCR we characterized gut bacterial communities across the life cycle of A. cerana from larvae to workers. Our results indicate that the presence and quantity of these four bacteria were low on day 1, increased rapidly after day 5, and then peaked during days 10-20. They stabilized from days 20-25 or days 25-30, then dropped to a low level at day 30. In addition, the larvae infected by Sacbrood virus or European foulbrood had significantly lower copies of 16S rRNA genes than healthy individuals. © 2015.

Mite infestation during development alters the in-hive behaviour of adult honeybees	Honeybee colonies (Apis mellifera) host a number of parasites, among which the mite Varroa destructor has been implicated in colony losses recorded around the world in recent years. Although many studies have been carried out on the direct and indirect damage caused by the mite to its host, the possible influence of mite infestation on the in-hive behaviour of honeybees has received little attention so far; moreover, to our knowledge, no behavioural study has been performed on adult bees infested during the pupal stage, which is when the mite causes most of its detrimental effects. In order to assess any possible consequence of infestation on the in-hive behaviour of honeybees, we carried out detailed observations on adult bees artificially infested during the pupal stage. We recorded a higher proportion of inactive bees among the infested ones; moreover, we observed that infested bees are less involved in tending larvae and dealing with hive duties compared to their uninfested mates. These results allow to draw some hypotheses which could be tested using the infestation method presented here. © 2014, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		adult, honeybee, mite, parasitology, pupa, virus, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Deformed wing virus, Varroa destructor	2015-05-01
A national survey of managed honey bee 2013–2014 annual colony losses in the USA	Honey bee colony losses are a major concern in the USA and across the globe. Long-term data on losses are critical for putting yearly losses in context. US colony loss surveys have been conducted yearly since the winter of 2006–2007. Here, we report the results from the eighth annual survey on winter losses and the second annual survey of summer and annual losses. There were 7425 valid respondents (7123 backyard, 190 sideline, and 112 commercial beekeepers) managing 497,855 colonies, 19 % of the total US colonies. Total losses reported were 19.8 % [95 % CI 19.3–20.3 %] over the summer, 23.7 % [95 % CI 23.3–24.1 %] over the winter, and 34.1 % [95 % CI 33.6–34.6 %] for the whole year. Average losses were 15.1 % [95 % CI 14.5–15.7 %] over the summer, 44.8 % [95 % CI 43.9–45.7 %] over the winter, and 51.1 % [95 % CI 50.2–51.6 %] for the whole year. While total winter loss was one of the lowest reported in 8 years, 66 % of all beekeepers had higher losses than they deemed acceptable. © 2015, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		apiculture, biological survey, colony, honeybee, mortality, United States, Apis mellifera	2015-05-01
Heterotrophic bacteria associated with Varroa destructor mite	Varroa bee hive attack is a serious and common problem in bee keeping. In our work, an ecto-microflora of Varroa destructor mites was characterised as a potential source of bacterial bee diseases. Using a cultivation approach, a variable population of bacteria was isolated from the body surface of Varroa mites with frequency of about 150 cfu per mite individual. Nine studied isolates were classified to four genera and six species by a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)- and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-based methods, suggesting relatively low diversity of Varroa mite-associated ecto-microflora. The Varroa mite-associated bacterial population was found to be dominated by Gram-positive bacteria of Bacillus and Microbacterium genera. Gram-negative bacteria were represented by members of Brevundimonas and Rhizobium genera. Most of the identified species are not known to be associated with Varroa mite, either honey bee or honey up until now and some of them are probably representatives of new bacterial taxa. © 2014, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		bacteriology, bacterium, heterotrophy, mite, new taxon, species diversity, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Bacillus (bacterium), Bacteria (microorganisms), Brevundimonas, Microbacterium, Negibacteria, Posibacteria, Rhizobium, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2015-05-01
Honey bee surveillance: A tool for understanding and improving honey bee health	Honey bee surveillance systems are increasingly used to characterize honey bee health and disease burdens of bees in different regions and/or over time. In addition to quantifying disease prevalence, surveillance systems can identify risk factors associated with colony morbidity and mortality. Surveillance systems are often observational, and prove particularly useful when searching for risk factors in real world complex systems. We review recent examples of surveillance systems with particular emphasis on how these efforts have helped increase our understanding of honey bee health.		Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2015-04-28
Death of the bee hive: Understanding the failure of an insect society	Since 2007 honey bee colony failure rates overwinter have averaged about 30% across much of North America. In addition, cases of extremely rapid colony failure have been reported, which has been termed colony collapse disorder. Both phenomena result from an increase in the frequency and intensity of chronic diseases and environmental stressors. Colonies are often challenged by multiple stressors, which can interact: for example, pesticides can enhance disease transmission in colonies. Colonies may be particularly vulnerable to sublethal effects of pathogens and pesticides since colony functions are compromised whether a stressor kills workers, or causes them to fail at foraging. Modelling provides a way to understand the processes of colony failure by relating impacts of stressors to colony-level functions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Phenotypic and genetic analyses of the Varroa sensitive hygienic trait in Russian honey bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) colonies	Varroa destructorcontinues to threaten colonies of European honey bees. General hygiene, and more specific Varroa Sensitive Hygiene (VSH), provide resistance towards the Varroa mite in a number of stocks. In this study, 32 Russian (RHB) and 14 Italian honey bee colonies were assessed for the VSH trait using two different assays. Firstly, colonies were assessed using the standard VSH behavioural assay of the change in infestation of a highly infested donor comb after a one-week exposure. Secondly, the same colonies were assessed using an "actual brood removal assay" that measured the removal of brood in a section created within the donor combs as a potential alternative measure of hygiene towards Varroa-infested brood. All colonies were then analysed for the recently discovered VSH quantitative trait locus (QTL) to determine whether the genetic mechanisms were similar across different stocks. Based on the two assays, RHB colonies were consistently more hygienic toward Varroa-infested brood than Italian honey bee colonies. The actual number of brood cells removed in the defined section was negatively correlated with the Varroa infestations of the colonies (r2 = 0.25). Only two (percentages of brood removed and reproductive foundress Varroa) out of nine phenotypic parameters showed significant associations with genotype distributions. However, the allele associated with each parameter was the opposite of that determined by VSH mapping. In this study, RHB colonies showed high levels of hygienic behaviour towards Varroa -infested brood. The genetic mechanisms are similar to those of the VSH stock, though the opposite allele associates in RHB, indicating a stable recombination event before the selection of the VSH stock. The measurement of brood removal is a simple, reliable alternative method of measuring hygienic behaviour towards Varroa mites, at least in RHB stock. © 2015, Public Library of Science.

Extensive intra-phylotype diversity in lactobacilli and bifidobacteria from the honeybee gut	In the honeybee Apis mellifera, the bacterial gut community is consistently colonized by eight distinct phylotypes of bacteria. Managed bee colonies are of considerable economic interest and it is therefore important to elucidate the diversity and role of this microbiota in the honeybee. In this study, we have sequenced the genomes of eleven strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from the honey crop of the honeybee A. mellifera. Results: Single gene phylogenies confirmed that the isolated strains represent the diversity of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the gut, as previously identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Core genome phylogenies of the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria further indicated extensive divergence between strains classified as the same phylotype. Phylotype-specific protein families included unique surface proteins. Within phylotypes, we found a remarkably high level of gene content diversity. Carbohydrate metabolism and transport functions contributed up to 45% of the accessory genes, with some genomes having a higher content of genes encoding phosphotransferase systems for the uptake of carbohydrates than any previously sequenced genome. These genes were often located in highly variable genomic segments that also contained genes for enzymes involved in the degradation and modification of sugar residues. Strain-specific gene clusters for the biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides were identified in two phylotypes. The dynamics of these segments contrasted with low recombination frequencies and conserved gene order structures for the core genes. Hits for CRISPR spacers were almost exclusively found within phylotypes, suggesting that the phylotypes are associated with distinct phage populations. Conclusions: The honeybee gut microbiota has been described as consisting of a modest number of phylotypes; however, the genomes sequenced in the current study demonstrated a very high level of gene content diversity within all three described phylotypes of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, particularly in terms of metabolic functions and surface structures, where many features were strain-specific. Together, these results indicate niche differentiation within phylotypes, suggesting that the honeybee gut microbiota is more complex than previously thought. © 2015 Ellegaard et al.		phosphotransferase, RNA 16S, bacterial DNA, RNA 16S, adaptive immunity, Apis mellifera, Article, bacterial genome, bacterial strain, bacteriophage, bacterium isolate, Bifidobacteriaceae, carbohydrate metabolism, cell differentiation, comparative genomic hybridization, enzyme degradation, enzyme modification, enzyme synthesis, fermentation, Firmicutes, gene cluster, gene frequency, gene sequence, genetic variability, homologous recombination, honeybee, intestine, lactic acid bacterium, Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helsingborgensis, Lactobacillus kimbladii, Lactobacillus kullabergensis, Lactobacillus mellifer, Lactobacillus mellis, Lactobacillus melliventris, microbial community, microflora, nonhuman, phylogenetic tree, phylogeny, plasmid, protein domain, protein function, stem cell niche, synteny, animal, bee, Bifidobacterium, classification, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat, DNA sequence, genetic variation, genetics, isolation and purification, Lactobacillus, metabolism, microbiology, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Bacteria (microorganisms), Firmicutes, Lactobacillus, Animals, Bees, Bifidobacterium, Carbohydrate Metabolism, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, Comparative Genomic Hybridization, DNA, Bacterial, Genetic Variation, Genome, Bacterial, Intestines, Lactobacillus, Microbiota, Phylogeny, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Sequence Analysis, DNA	2015-04-11
Honey bee colony losses and associated viruses	Recent large-scale colony losses among managed Western honey bees (Apis mellifera) have alarmed researchers and apiculturists alike. Here, the existing correlative evidence provided by monitoring studies is reviewed which (i) identified members of the deformed wing virus and acute bee paralysis virus clades as lethal pathogens for entire colonies, and (ii) identified novel viruses whose impact on honey bee health remains elusive. Also discussed in this review is related evidence obtained via controlled experimental infection assays and RNAi approaches underscoring the damage inflicted by some of these viruses on individuals and colonies. The relevance of the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor acting as mechanical and biological virus vector for the enhanced virulence of certain viruses or mite selected virus strains is carefully considered. ï¿½ 2015 Elsevier Inc.			2015-04-01
Bee health: Background and issures for congress	Bees, both commercially managed honey bees and wild bees, play an important role in global food production. In the United States alone, the value of insect pollination to U.S. agricultural production is estimated at $16 billion annually, of which about three-fourths is attributable to honey bees. Worldwide, the contribution of bees and other insects to global crop production for human food is valued at about $190 billion. Given the importance of honey bees and other bee species to food production, many have expressed concern about whether a "pollinator crisis" has been occurring in recent decades. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Bee health: The role of pesticides	Over the past few decades there has been heightened concern about the plight of honey bees as well as other bee species. Given the importance of honey bees and other bee species to food production, many have expressed concern about whether a "pollinator crisis" has been occurring in recent decades. Although honey bee colony losses due to bee pests, parasites, pathogens, and disease are not uncommon, there is the perception that bee health has been declining more rapidly than in prior years, both in the United States and globally. This situation gained increased attention in 2006 as some commercial beekeepers began reporting sharp declines in their honey bee colonies. Because of the severity and unusual circumstances of these colony declines, scientists named this phenomenon colony collapse disorder (CCD). Since then, honey bee colonies have continued to dwindle each year, for reasons not solely attributable to CCD. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that CCD may not be the only or even the major cause of bee colony losses in recent years. In the United States, USDA estimates of overwinter colony losses from all causes have averaged nearly 30% annually since 2006. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.			2015-04-01
Organophosphorus insecticides in honey, pollen and bees (Apis mellifera L.) and their potential hazard to bee colonies in Egypt	There is no clear single factor to date that explains colony loss in bees, but one factor proposed is the wide-spread application of agrochemicals. Concentrations of 14 organophosphorous insecticides (OPs) in honey bees (. Apis mellifera) and hive matrices (honey and pollen) were measured to assess their hazard to honey bees. Samples were collected during spring and summer of 2013, from 5 provinces in the middle delta of Egypt. LC/MS-MS was used to identify and quantify individual OPs by use of a modified Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged Safe (QuEChERS) method. Pesticides were detected more frequently in samples collected during summer. Pollen contained the greatest concentrations of OPs. Profenofos, chlorpyrifos, malation and diazinon were the most frequently detected OPs. In contrast, ethoprop, phorate, coumaphos and chlorpyrifos-oxon were not detected. A toxic units approach, with lethality as the endpoint was used in an additive model to assess the cumulative potential for adverse effects posed by OPs. Hazard quotients (HQs) in honey and pollen ranged from 0.01-0.05 during spring and from 0.02-0.08 during summer, respectively. HQs based on lethality due to direct exposure of adult worker bees to OPs during spring and summer ranged from 0.04 to 0.1 for best and worst case respectively. It is concluded that direct exposure and/or dietary exposure to OPs in honey and pollen pose little threat due to lethality of bees in Egypt. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.		chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos oxon, coumafos, dimpylate, ethoprop, malation, organophosphate insecticide, phorate, profenofos, unclassified drug, insecticide, organophosphorus compound, colony, concentration (composition), hazard assessment, honeybee, organophosphorus pesticide, pollution effect, pollution exposure, risk assessment, Apis mellifera, Article, concentration (parameters), Egypt, exposure, hazard assessment, honey, imago, lethality, liquid chromatography, nonhuman, organism colony, pesticide spraying, pollen, quantitative analysis, spring, summer, tandem mass spectrometry, toxicity testing, worker (insect), analysis, animal, bee, chemistry, drug effects, growth, development and aging, high performance liquid chromatography, honey, limit of detection, pollen, season, Egypt, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Animals, Bees, Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid, Egypt, Honey, Insecticides, Limit of Detection, Organophosphorus Compounds, Pollen, Seasons, Tandem Mass Spectrometry	2015-04-01
Foraging Allocation in the Honey Bee, Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera, Apidae), Tuned by the Presence of the Spinosad-Based Pesticide GF-120	Agroecosystem management commonly involves the use of pesticides. As a result, a heterogeneous landscape is created, in which suitable and unsuitable spaces are defined by the absence/presence of pesticides. In this study, we explored how foragers of the honey bee, Apis mellifera L., adapt to such context. We specifically evaluated the effect of GF-120, a spinosad-based fruit fly toxic bait, on the allocation of foragers between food sources under the hypothesis that foragers will move from food sources with GF-120 to food sources without it. We thus carried out three experiments: in experiment 1, a group of foragers was trained to collect honey solution from a feeder; next, this feeder offered a GF-120/honey solution. A minority of foragers continued collecting the GF-120/honey solution. In experiment 2, we trained two groups of foragers from a colony to two food sources equally rewarding. Next, GF-120 was added to one of the food sources. We found that the majority of foragers moved from the GF-120-treated feeder to the feeder without GF-120 and that the minority that continued visiting the GF-120-treated feeder did not collect the GF-120/honey solution. In a third experiment, we wanted to know if foragers in an experimental setup as in experiment 1 would perform waggle dances: none of the foragers that collected GF-120/honey were observed dancing. Our results emphasize the importance of “food refuges” for non-target species, since they minimize the impact of agrochemicals upon them. © 2015, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.

Evidence for weak genetic recombination at the PTP2 locus of Nosema ceranae	Summary: The microsporidian Nosema ceranae is an emergent pathogen that threatens the health of honeybees and other pollinators all over the world. Its recent rapid spread across a wide variety of host species and environments demonstrated an enhanced ability of adaptation, which seems to contradict the lack of evidence for genetic recombination and the absence of a sexual stage in its life cycle. Here we retrieved fresh data of the patterns of genetic variation at the PTP2 locus in naturally infected Apis mellifera colonies, by means of single genome amplification. This technique, designed to prevent the formation of chimeric haplotypes during polymerase chain reaction (PCR), provides more reliable estimates of the diversity levels and haplotype structure than standard PCR-cloning methods. Our results are consistent with low but significant rates of recombination in the history of the haplotypes detected: estimates of the population recombination rate are of the order of 30 and support recent evidence for unexpectedly high levels of variation of the parasites within honeybee colonies. These observations suggest the existence of a diploid stage at some point in the life cycle of this parasite and are relevant for our understanding of the dynamics of its expanding population. © 2014 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Recent worldwide expansion of Nosema ceranae (Microsporidia) in Apis mellifera populations inferred from multilocus patterns of genetic variation	Nosema ceranae has been found infecting Apis mellifera colonies with increasing frequency and it now represents a major threat to the health and long-term survival of these honeybees worldwide. However, so far little is known about the population genetics of this parasite. Here, we describe the patterns of genetic variation at three genomic loci in a collection of isolates from all over the world. Our main findings are: (i) the levels of genetic polymorphism (πS≈1%) do not vary significantly across its distribution range, (ii) there is substantial evidence for recombination among haplotypes, (iii) the best part of the observed genetic variance corresponds to differences within bee colonies (up to 88% of the total variance), (iv) parasites collected from Asian honeybees (Apis cerana and Apis florea) display significant differentiation from those obtained from Apis mellifera (8-16% of the total variance, p<0.01) and (v) there is a significant excess of low frequency variants over neutral expectations among samples obtained from A. mellifera, but not from Asian honeybees. Overall these results are consistent with a recent colonization and rapid expansion of N. ceranae throughout A. mellifera colonies. © 2015 .

Emerging viral disease risk to pollinating insects: Ecological, evolutionary and anthropogenic factors	The potential for infectious pathogens to spillover and emerge from managed populations to wildlife communities is poorly understood, but ecological, evolutionary and anthropogenic factors are all likely to influence the initial exposure and subsequent infection, spread and impact of disease. Fast-evolving RNA viruses, known to cause severe colony losses in managed honeybee populations, deserve particular attention for their propensity to jump between host species and thus threaten ecologically and economically important wild pollinator communities. We review the literature on pollinator viruses to identify biological and anthropogenic drivers of disease emergence, highlight gaps in the literature, and discuss potential management strategies. We provide evidence that many wild pollinator species are exposed to viruses from commercial species, resulting in multiple spillover events. However, it is not clear whether species become infected as a result of spillover or whether transmission is occurring within these wild populations. Ecological traits of pollinating insects, such as overlapping ranges, niches and behaviours, clearly promote cross-species transmission of RNA viruses. Moreover, we conclude that the social behaviour and phylogenetic relatedness of social pollinators further facilitate within- and between-host transmission, leaving these species particularly vulnerable to emerging diseases. We argue that the commercial use of pollinators is a key driver of disease emergence in these beneficial insects and that this must be addressed by management and policy. Synthesis and applications. There are important knowledge gaps, ranging from disease distribution and prevalence, to pathogen life history and virulence, to the impacts of disease emergence, which need to be addressed as research priorities. It is clear that avoiding anthropogenic pathogen spillover is crucial to preventing and managing disease emergence in pollinators, with far-reaching effects on our food security, ecosystem services and biodiversity. We argue that it is crucial to prevent the introduction of diseased pollinators into natural environments, which can be achieved through improved monitoring and management practices. ï¿½ 2015 The Authors.		anthropogenic effect, disease transmission, ecological impact, ecosystem service, evolutionary biology, honeybee, life history, management practice, pollinator, risk assessment, RNA, viral disease, wildlife management, Apis mellifera, Hexapoda, RNA viruses	2015-04-01
Genome sequence of the Drosophila melanogaster male-killing Spiroplasma strain MSRO endosymbiont	Spiroplasmas are helical and motile members of a cell wall-less eubacterial group called Mollicutes. Although all spiroplasmas are associated with arthropods, they exhibit great diversity with respect to both their modes of transmission and their effects on their hosts; ranging from horizontally transmitted pathogens and commensals to endosymbionts that are transmitted transovarially (i.e., from mother to offspring). Here we provide the first genome sequence, along with proteomic validation, of an endosymbiotic inherited Spiroplasma bacterium, the Spiroplasma poulsonii MSRO strain harbored by Drosophila melanogaster. Comparison of the genome content of S. poulsonii with that of horizontally transmitted spiroplasmas indicates that S. poulsonii has lost many metabolic pathways and transporters, demonstrating a high level of interdependence with its insect host. Consistent with genome analysis, experimental studies showed that S. poulsonii metabolizes glucose but not trehalose. Notably, trehalose is more abundant than glucose in Drosophila hemolymph, and the inability to metabolize trehalose may prevent S. poulsonii from overproliferating. Our study identifies putative virulence genes, notably, those for a chitinase, the H2O2-producing glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase, and enzymes involved in the synthesis of the eukaryote-toxic lipid cardiolipin. S. poulsonii also expresses on the cell membrane one functional adhesion-related protein and two divergent spiralin proteins that have been implicated in insect cell invasion in other spiroplasmas. These lipoproteins may be involved in the colonization of the Drosophila germ line, ensuring S. poulsonii vertical transmission. The S. poulsonii genome is a valuable resource to explore the mechanisms of male killing and symbiont-mediated protection, two cardinal features of many facultative endosymbionts. IMPORTANCE Most insect species, including important disease vectors and crop pests, harbor vertically transmitted endosymbiotic bacteria. These endosymbionts play key roles in their hosts' fitness, including protecting them against natural enemies and manipulating their reproduction in ways that increase the frequency of symbiont infection. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie these processes. Here, we provide the first genome draft of a vertically transmitted male-killing Spiroplasma bacterium, the S. poulsonii MSRO strain harbored by D. melanogaster. Analysis of the S. poulsonii genome was complemented by proteomics and ex vivo metabolic experiments. Our results indicate that S. poulsonii has reduced metabolic capabilities and expresses divergent membrane lipoproteins and potential virulence factors that likely participate in Spiroplasma-host interactions. This work fills a gap in our knowledge of insect endosymbionts and provides tools with which to decipher the interaction between Spiroplasma bacteria and their well-characterized host D. melanogaster, which is emerging as a model of endosymbiosis.

The 10 Principles of Food Industry Sustainability	Although the food industry is beginning to make headway with its sustainability initiatives, substantially more progress is needed in order to feed the world's growing population sustainably. The challenge is that the topic of sustainability can seem overwhelming and there is limited information that is specific to the food industry. Written by an experienced food industry professional with years of experience in sustainability, The 10 Principles of Food Industry Sustainability inspires and informs the progress required to nourish the population, revitalize natural resources, enhance economic development, and close resource loops. The book makes this complex topic approachable and actionable by identifying the most pressing sustainability priorities across the entire food supply chain and showing, with tools and examples, how producers, processors, packers, distributors, marketers and retailers all play a role in advancing improvement. The book begins with an overview of the Principles of sustainability in the food industry: what they are and why they matter. Subsequent chapters focus on each of the Ten Principles in detail: how they relate to the food industry, their global relevance (including their environmental, health, and social impacts), and the best practices to achieve the potential of meaningful and positive progress that the Principles offer. Specific examples from industry are presented in order to provide scalable solutions and bring the concepts to life, along with top resources for further exploration. The Principles, practices, and potential of sustainability in the food industry covered in this book are designed to be motivating and to offer a much-needed and clear way forward towards a sustainable food supply. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

No evidence of enemy release in pathogen and microbial communities of common wasps (vespula vulgaris) in their native and introduced range	When invasive species move to new environments they typically experience population bottlenecks that limit the probability that pathogens and parasites are also moved. The invasive species may thus be released from biotic interactions that can be a major source of density-dependent mortality, referred to as enemy release. We examined for evidence of enemy release in populations of the common wasp (Vespula vulgaris), which attains high densities and represents a major threat to biodiversity in its invaded range. Mass spectrometry prote-omic methods were used to compare the microbial communities in wasp populations in the native (Belgium and England) and invaded range (Argentina and New Zealand). We found no evidence of enemy release, as the number of microbial taxa was similar in both the introduced and native range. However, some evidence of distinctiveness in the microbial communities was observed between countries. The pathogens observed were similar to a variety of taxa observed in honey bees. These taxa included Nosema, Paenibacillus, and Yersina spp. Genomic methods confirmed a diversity of Nosema spp., Actinobacteria, and the Deformed wing and Kashmir bee viruses. We also analysed published records of bacteria, viruses, nematodes and fungi from both V. vulgaris and the related invader V. germanica. Thirty-three different microorganism taxa have been associated with wasps including Kashmir bee virus and entomophagous fungi such as Aspergillus flavus. There was no evidence that the presence or absence of these microorganisms was dependent on region of wasp samples (i.e. their native or invaded range). Given the similarity of the wasp pathogen fauna to that from honey bees, the lack of enemy release in wasp populations is probably related to spill-over or spill-back from bees and other social insects. Social insects appear to form a reservoir of generalist parasites and pathogens, which makes the management of wasp and bee disease difficult. © 2015 Lester et al.

Intersections between neonicotinoid seed treatments and honey bees	Abstract A growing understanding of the often subtle unintended impacts of neonicotinoid seed treatments on both non-target organisms and their environment have led to concerns about the suitability of current pest management approaches in large scale agriculture. Several neonicotinoid compounds are used in seed treatments of the most widely grown grain and oilseed crops worldwide. Most applications are made prophylactically and without prior knowledge of pest populations. A growing body of evidence suggests that these compounds become contaminants of soil, water, and plant products, including pollen and nectar. These unforeseen routes of exposure are documented to have negative impacts on honey bee health and also have potential to exert effects on a broader environmental scale. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Differential responses of Africanized and European honey bees (Apis mellifera) to viral replication following mechanical transmission or Varroa destructor parasitism	For the first time, adults and brood of Africanized and European honey bees (. Apis mellifera) were compared for relative virus levels over 48. h following Varroa destructor parasitism or injection of V. destructor homogenate. Rates of increase of deformed wing virus (DWV) for Africanized versus European bees were temporarily lowered for 12. h with parasitism and sustainably lowered over the entire experiment (48. h) with homogenate injection in adults. The rates were also temporarily lowered for 24. h with parasitism but were not affected by homogenate injection in brood. Rates of increase of black queen cell virus (BQCV) for Africanized versus European bees were similar with parasitism but sustainably lowered over the entire experiment with homogenate injection in adults and were similar for parasitism and homogenate injection in brood. Analyses of sac brood bee virus and Israeli acute paralysis virus were limited as detection did not occur after both homogenate injection and parasitism treatment, or levels were not significantly higher than those following control buffer injection. Lower rates of replication of DWV and BQCV in Africanized bees shows that they may have greater viral resistance, at least early after treatment. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Parallel Epigenomic and Transcriptomic Responses to Viral Infection in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera)	Populations of honey bees are declining throughout the world, with US beekeepers losing 30% of their colonies each winter. Though multiple factors are driving these colony losses, it is increasingly clear that viruses play a major role. However, information about the molecular mechanisms mediating antiviral immunity in honey bees is surprisingly limited. Here, we examined the transcriptional and epigenetic (DNA methylation) responses to viral infection in honey bee workers. One-day old worker honey bees were fed solutions containing Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV), a virus which causes muscle paralysis and death and has previously been associated with colony loss. Uninfected control and infected, symptomatic bees were collected within 20–24 hours after infection. Worker fat bodies, the primary tissue involved in metabolism, detoxification and immune responses, were collected for analysis. We performed transcriptome- and bisulfite-sequencing of the worker fat bodies to identify genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation patterns associated with viral infection. There were 753 differentially expressed genes (FDR<0.05) in infected versus control bees, including several genes involved in epigenetic and antiviral pathways. DNA methylation status of 156 genes (FDR<0.1) changed significantly as a result of the infection, including those involved in antiviral responses in humans. There was no significant overlap between the significantly differentially expressed and significantly differentially methylated genes, and indeed, the genomic characteristics of these sets of genes were quite distinct. Our results indicate that honey bees have two distinct molecular pathways, mediated by transcription and methylation, that modulate protein levels and/or function in response to viral infections. © 2015 Galbraith et al.		bisulfite, RNA, insect protein, transcriptome, alternative RNA splicing, animal experiment, animal model, antiviral activity, Apis mellifera, Article, bee extract, controlled study, CpG island, detoxification, Dicistroviridae, DNA methylation, Drosophila melanogaster, epigenetics, Escherichia coli, exon, gene expression, gene expression regulation, gene ontology, immune response, nonhuman, overlapping gene, real time polymerase chain reaction, RNA sequence, sequence analysis, transcription regulation, transcriptomics, validation process, virus infection, animal, bee, biosynthesis, gene expression profiling, genetic epigenesis, genetics, metabolism, Picornaviridae, picornavirus infection, virology, Acute bee paralysis virus, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Animals, Bees, Epigenesis, Genetic, Gene Expression Profiling, Insect Proteins, Picornaviridae, Picornaviridae Infections, Transcriptome	2015-03-01
Lower virus infections in Varroa destructor-infested and uninfested brood and adult honey bees (Apis mellifera) of a low mite population growth colony compared to a high mite population growth colony	A comparison was made of the prevalence and relative quantification of deformed wing virus (DWV), Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), black queen cell virus (BQCV), Kashmir bee virus (KBV), acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) and sac brood virus (SBV) in brood and adult honey bees (Apis mellifera) from colonies selected for high (HMP) and low (LMP) Varroa destructor mite population growth. Two viruses, ABPV and SBV, were never detected. For adults without mite infestation, DWV, IAPV, BQCV and KBV were detected in the HMP colony; however, only BQCV was detected in the LMP colony but at similar levels as in the HMP colony. With mite infestation, the four viruses were detected in adults of the HMP colony but all at higher amounts than in the LMP colony. For brood without mite infestation, DWV and IAPV were detected in the HMP colony, but no viruses were detected in the LMP colony. With mite infestation of brood, the four viruses were detected in the HMP colony, but only DWV and IAPV were detected and at lower amounts in the LMP colony. An epidemiological explanation for these results is that pre-experiment differences in virus presence and levels existed between the HMP and LMP colonies. It is also possible that low V. destructor population growth in the LMP colony resulted in the bees being less exposed to the mite and thus less likely to have virus infections. LMP and HMP bees may have also differed in susceptibility to virus infection. © 2015 Emsen et al.

Neonicotinoid insecticide residues in surface water and soil associated with commercial maize (corn) fields in Southwestern Ontario	Neonicotinoid insecticides have come under scrutiny for their potential unintended effects on non-target organisms, particularly pollinators in agro-ecosystems. As part of a larger study of neonicotinoid residues associated with maize (corn) production, 76 water samples within or around the perimeter of 18 commercial maize fields and neighbouring apiaries were collected in 5 maize-producing counties of southwestern Ontario. Residues of clothianidin (mean = 2.28, max. = 43.60 ng/mL) and thiamethoxam (mean = 1.12, max. = 16.50 ng/mL) were detected in 100 and 98.7%of the water samples tested, respectively. The concentration of total neonicotinoid residues in water within maize fields increased six-fold during the first five weeks after planting, and returned to pre-plant levels seven weeks after planting. However, concentrations in water sampled from outside the fields were similar throughout the sampling period. Soil samples from the top 5 cm of the soil profile were also collected in these fields before and immediately following planting. The mean total neonicotinoid residue was 4.02 (range 0.07 to 20.30) ng/g, for samples taken before planting, and 9.94 (range 0.53 to 38.98) ng/g, for those taken immediately after planting. Two soil samples collected from within an conservation area contained detectable (0.03 and 0.11 ng/g) concentrations of clothianidin. Of three drifted snow samples taken, the drift stratum containing the most wind-scoured soil had 0.16 and 0.20 ng/mL mainly clothianidin in the melted snow. The concentration was at the limit of detection (0.02 ng/mL) taken across the entire vertical profile. With the exception of one sample, water samples tested had concentrations below those reported to have acute, chronic or sublethal effects to honey bees. Our results suggest that neonicotinoids may move off-target by wind erosion of contaminated soil.

Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) drone sperm quality in relation to age, genetic line, and time of breeding	A honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus; Hymenoptera: Apidae) queen's life expectancy is strongly dependent on the number of sperm she obtains by mating with drones during nuptial flights. Unexplained replacement of queens by the colony and young queens showing sperm depletions have been reported in North America, and reduced drone fertility has been a suspected cause. The aim of this study was to evaluate drone reproductive qualities during the queen-rearing season, from May to August. Drones from two different genetic lines were reared six times during the 2012 beekeeping season at our research centre in Québec (Canada). Semen volume as well as sperm number and viability were assessed at the ages of 14, 21, and 35 days. Results showed (1) a greater proportion of older drones with semen at the tip of the genitalia after eversion; (2) an influence of rearing date on semen production; and (3) no influence of drone genetic line, age or time of breeding on sperm viability. These results highlight the necessity of better understanding drone rearing and how it can be improved to ensure optimum honey-bee queen mating. © Entomological Society of Canada 2015.		age class, breeding, fertility, genetic analysis, honeybee, life expectancy, nuptial gift, qualitative analysis, queen, sperm, time allocation, viability, Canada, Quebec [Canada], Apidae, Apis mellifera, Hymenoptera	2015-02-24
Hologenome theory and the honey bee pathosphere	Recent research has provided improved genome-level views of diversity across global honey bee populations, the gut microbiota residing within them, and the expanding pathosphere challenging honey bees. Different combinations of bee/microbiota/pathosphere genome complexes may explain regional variation in apiculture productivity and mortality. To understand this, we must consider management and research approaches in light of a hologenome paradigm: that honey bee fitness is determined by the composite bee and microbiota genomes. Only by considering the hologenome can we truly interpret and address impacts from the pathosphere, pesticides, toxins, nutrition, climate and other stressors affecting bee health. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

RNAi and antiviral defense in the honey bee	Honey bees play an important agricultural and ecological role as pollinators of numerous agricultural crops and other plant species. Therefore, investigating the factors associated with high annual losses of honey bee colonies in the US is an important and active area of research. Pathogen incidence and abundance correlate with Colony Collapse Disorder- (CCD-) affected colonies in the US and colony losses in the US and in some European countries. Honey bees are readily infected by single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses. Largely dependent on the host immune response, virus infections can either remain asymptomatic or result in deformities, paralysis, or death of adults or larvae. RNA interference (RNAi) is an important antiviral defense mechanism in insects, including honey bees. Herein, we review the role of RNAi in honey bee antiviral defense and highlight some parallels between insect and mammalian immune systems. A more thorough understanding of the role of pathogens on honey bee health and the immune mechanisms bees utilize to combat infectious agents may lead to the development of strategies that enhance honey bee health and result in the discovery of additional mechanisms of immunity in metazoans. © 2015 Laura M.

Consumer demand for local honey	How to best target and attract niche market consumers is an important marketing problem for producers of specialty agricultural products. It is particularly an issue in the honey market where consumers increasingly face media messages regarding threats to honey bee health, honey adulteration and health benefits of locally produced honey. Using auction experiments, this research evaluates consumer behaviour related to informational messages about honey that is produced locally, domestically and internationally. Results from 115 adult consumers show that consumers’ demand for honey varies significantly based on the geographic location of the honey’s production, product packaging and the information they have about the product. Consumers demonstrate greater demand for locally produced honey, especially when provided information about negative aspects of internationally produced honey that include adulteration. This shows that such negative media attention on specialty products offers small producers an opportunity to increase profitability by marketing themselves as a specialized niche alternative. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.		consumption behavior, demand analysis, food market, food safety, health impact, marketing, media role, profitability, Apis mellifera	2015-01-01
The paratransgenic potential of Lactobacillus kunkeei in the honey bee Apis mellifera	The honey bee (Apis mellifera) is a domestic insect of high value to human societies, as a crop pollinator in agriculture and a model animal in scientific research. The honey bee, however, has experienced massive mortality worldwide due to the phenomenon Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), resulting in alarming prospects for crop failure in Europe and the USA. The reasons for CCD are complex and much debated, but several honey bee pathogens are believed to be involved. Paratransgenesis is a Trojan horse strategy, where endogenous microorganisms are used to express effector molecules that antagonise pathogen development. For use in honey bees, paratransgenesis must rely on a set of criteria that the candidate paratransgenic microorganism must fulfil in order to obtain a successful outcome: (1) the candidate must be genetically modifiable to express effector molecules; (2) the modified organism should have no adverse effects on honey bee health upon reintroduction; and (3) it must survive together with other non-pathogenic bee-associated microorganisms. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are common gut bacteria in vertebrates and invertebrates, and some have naturally beneficial properties in their host. In the present work we aimed to find a potential paratransgenic candidate within this bacterial group for use in honey bees. Among isolated LAB associated with bee gut microbiota, we found the fructophilic Lactobacillus kunkeei to be the most predominant species during foraging seasons. Four genetically different strains of L. kunkeei were selected for further assessment. We demonstrated (1) that L. kunkeei is transformable; (2) that the transformed cells had no obvious adverse effect on honey bee survival; and (3) that transformed cells survived well in the gut environment of bees upon reintroduction. Our study demonstrates that L. kunkeei fulfils the three criteria for paratransgenesis and can be a suitable candidate for further research on this strategy in honey bees. © 2015 Wageningen Academic Publishers.		animal tissue, Apis mellifera, Article, bacterial cell, bacterial strain, bacterium isolation, bacterium transformation, cell survival, controlled study, foraging, intestine flora, Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus kunkeei, nonhuman, paratransgenesis, paratransgenic organism, transgenic organism, transgenics, animal, bee, gastrointestinal tract, genetics, growth, development and aging, Lactobacillus, microbial viability, microbiology, transgenic organism, Animals, Bees, Gastrointestinal Tract, Lactobacillus, Microbial Viability, Organisms, Genetically Modified, Transformation, Bacterial	2015-01-01
A New Stratified Sampling Procedure which Decreases Error Estimation of Varroa Mite Number on Sticky Boards	A new procedure of stratified sampling is proposed in order to establish an accurate estimation of Varroa destructor populations on sticky bottom boards of the hive. It is based on the spatial sampling theory that recommends using regular grid stratification in the case of spatially structured process. The distribution of varroa mites on sticky board being observed as spatially structured, we designed a sampling scheme based on a regular grid with circles centered on each grid element. This new procedure is then compared with a former method using partially random sampling. Relative error improvements are exposed on the basis of a large sample of simulated sticky boards (n = 20,000) which provides a complete range of spatial structures, from a random structure to a highly frame driven structure.

Varroa destructor mite in Africanized honeybee colonies Apis mellifera L. Under royal jelly or honey production	This study evaluated the level of invasion of Varroa mite into worker brood cells, the infestation rate on adult worker honeybees, total and effective reproduction rates of the mite in Africanized honeybee colonies under royal jelly or honey production. Invasion and infestation rates were not statistically different between honeybee colonies producing honey or royal jelly and the averages for these parameters were 5.79 and 8.54%, respectively. Colonies producing honey presented a higher (p < 0.05) total and effective reproduction of Varroa than colonies producing royal jelly. There was a negative correlation between levels of invasion and infestation with minimum external temperature, relative humidity and rainfall. The variables month and season influenced the development of the mite, but rates were low and within the range normally found in Brazil for Africanized honeybee colonies, which confirm the greater resistance of these honeybees to Varroa destructor than European honeybees. © 2015, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

A severe sacbrood virus outbreak in a honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) colony: A case report	A honeybee colony, part of an apiary of nine, showed abnormalities in brood pattern and was thus presented for study. A classic veterinary medicine approach has allowed the diagnosis of a severe case of sacbrood virus (SBV) confirmed by a high viral load in affected larvae. SBV is known to infect larvae of the honeybee (Apis mellifera), resulting in failure to pupate and ultimately death of infected larvae. Several contributing factors combined, among them the parasite Varroa destructor, have been identified in this particular affected colony to explain the clinical outbreak of the disease whereas, in the majority of cases, infected colonies remain asymptomatic. As no specific cure of honeybee viruses is available, the management of these contributing factors is essential, including feeding of colonies and control of the Varroa parasite. After implementation of management solutions, the colony rapidly recovered in six weeks, but did not recommence honey production and remained at higher risk of a winter collapse. An earlier control management would have been more effective: regular visits of the colonies by the beekeepers should be the rule in order to detect abnormalities and also to detect and eliminate as early as possible the combination of factors that contribute to the proliferation of the virus.

Pesticide residues analysis in honey using ethyl acetate extraction method: validation and pilot survey in real samples	This paper presents a cost-effective and validated multi residue confirmatory method for the determination of 167 chemically different pesticides and a survey study on Cyprus honey samples. This method uses ethyl acetate for the extraction of pesticides from honey and the determination is performed with liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) operating in tandem mode (MS/MS) and with GC–ECD (gas chromatography with electron capture detector) analysis. The LC-MS/MS analytical system is especially important in the analysis of polar and non-volatile pesticides. For the validation of the method, blank honey samples were spiked with 146 pesticides (organophosphorous, carbamates, triazoles, amides, neonicodinoids, strobilurines, phenylureas, bendimidazoles and others) for the LC-MS/MS analysis at three levels: 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 mg kg−1 and with 21 pesticides for the GC-ECD analysis at two levels: 0.01 and 0.05 mg kg−1for organochlorines and 0.05 and 0.2 mg kg−1for the pyrethroids. As blank sample, a sample of honey which did not contain detectable levels of the analytes sought was used. The validation study was in accordance to the DG SANCO guidelines. The scope of validation included recovery, linearity, limits of quantification and precision. Linearity is demonstrated all along the range of concentration that was investigated with correlation coefficients ≥0.98. Recoveries of the majority of compounds were in the 70%–120% range and were characterised by precision lower or equal to 20%. The validated method was used for a survey of 36 samples of honey produced in different areas of Cyprus and this is the first work on Cypriot honey samples investigating a broad range of pesticides. Only coumaphos was detected at concentrations higher than 0.01 mg kg−1 in the 58.6% of the honey samples analysed for Coumaphos. The results were evaluated in accordance to the provisions of the Commission Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 on pharmacologically active substances and their classification regarding maximum residue limits (MRLs) in foodstuffs of animal origin. The concentrations of coumaphos in all positive samples were at levels much lower than the MRL. © 2015 State General Laboratory of Ministry of Health, Cyprus.

Evaluating sub-lethal effects of orchard-applied pyrethroids using video-tracking software to quantify honey bee behaviors	Managed honey bee, Apis mellifera L., colonies are contracted to pollinate fruit and nut orchards improving crop quality and yield. Colonies placed in orchards are potentially exposed to pyrethroid insecticides used for broad-spectrum pest control. Pyrethroids have been reported to pose minimal risk to bees due to their low application rates in the field and putative repellent properties. This repellency is believed to alter foraging behavior with the benefit of preventing bees from encountering a lethal dose in the field. However, sub-lethal exposure to pyrethroids may adversely impact bee behavior potentially resulting in social dysfunction or disruption of foraging. This study quantified behaviors associated with sub-lethal exposure to orchard-applied pyrethroids including, lambda-cyhalothrin, esfenvalerate, and permethrin, using video tracking software, Ethovision XT (Noldus Information Technologies). Bee locomotion, social interaction, and time spent near a food source were measured over a 24-h period. Bees treated with a pyrethroid traveled 30-71% less than control bees. Social interaction time decreased by 43% for bees treated with a high sub-lethal dose of esfenvalerate. Bees exposed to a high sub-lethal dose of permethrin spent 67% less time in social interaction and spent more than 5 times as long in the food zone compared to control bees. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Regional variation in composition and antimicrobial activity of US propolis against Paenibacillus larvae and Ascosphaera apis	Propolis is a substance derived from antimicrobial plant resins that honey bees use in the construction of their nests. Propolis use in the hive is an important component of honey bee social immunity and confers a number of positive physiological benefits to bees. The benefits that bees derive from resins are mostly due to their antimicrobial properties, but it is unknown how the diversity of antimicrobial activities among resins might impact bee health. In our previous work, we found that resins from different North American Populus spp. differed in their ability to inhibit in vitro growth of the bee bacterial pathogen Paenibacillus larvae. The goal of our current work was to characterize the antimicrobial activity of propolis from 12 climatically diverse regions across the US against the bee pathogens P. larvae and Ascosphaera apis and compare the metabolite profiles among those samples using LC-MS-based metabolomic methods. Samples differed greatly in their ability to inhibit both bacterial and fungal growth in vitro, but propolis from Nevada, Texas, and California displayed high activity against both pathogens. Interestingly, propolis from Georgia, New York, Louisiana, and Minnesota were active against A. apis, but not very active against P. larvae. Metabolomic analysis of regional propolis samples revealed that each sample was compositionally distinct, and LC-FTMS profiles from each sample contained a unique number of shared and exclusive peaks. Propolis from Aspen, CO, Tuscon, AZ, and Raleigh, NC, contained relatively large numbers of exclusive peaks, which may indicate that these samples originated from relatively unique botanical sources. This is the first study to characterize how the diversity of bee preferred resinous plants in the US may affect bee health, and could guide future studies on the therapeutic potential of propolis for bees. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The acute oral toxicity of commonly used pesticides in Iran, to honeybees (Apis mellifera meda)	The honey bee is credited with approximately 85% of the pollinating activity necessary to supply about one-third of the world’s food supply. Well over 50 major crops depend on these insects for pollination. The crops produce more abundantly when honey bees are plentiful. Worker bees are the ones primarily affected by pesticides. Poisoning symptoms can vary depending on the developmental stage of the individual bee, and the kind of chemical employed. The oral toxicity of these insecticides: (phosalone and pirimicarb), acaricide (propargite), insecticide and acaricide (fenpropathrin), fungicides, and bactericides (copper oxychloride and the Bordeaux mixture), were evaluated for the purposes of this research. The results showed that fenpropathrin had high acute oral toxicity (LC50-24h and LC50-48 were 0.54 and 0.3 ppm, respectively). Propargite had 7785 ppm (active ingredient) for LC50-24h and 6736 ppm (active ingredient) for LC50-48h in honeybees and is therefore, non-toxic to Apis mellifera. On the other hand, copper oxychloride had minimum acute oral toxicity to honeybees (LC50-24h and LC50-48 were 4591.5 and 5407.9 ppm, respectively) and was therefore considered non-toxic. Also, the Bordeaux mixture was safe to use around honeybees. Phosalone and primicarb were considered highly and moderately toxic to honeybees, respectively. © 2015, J. APIC. SCI.

Aporte nutricional de polen de especies polinizadas por abejas (Apis mellifera L.) en la Regiï¿½n de La Araucanï¿½a, Chile	The present paper aims to determine the nutritional contribution of pollen from four cultivated species (Malus domestica Borkh., Eucalyptus globulus Labill., Brassica napus L. ssp. oleifera and Vaccinium corymbosum L.) pollinated by bees (Apis mellifera L.) in Southern Chile. The pollen was collected in helicoidal pollen traps installed in hives in farms located in different parts of the Region, and was subsequently analysed at the Bromatology Laboratory. The results obtained matched the values described in the literature, with ranges of phosphorus between 0.59 and 0.80%, crude protein between 33.27 and 39.04%, ethereal extract between 1.83 and 7.72%, carbohydrates between 19.62 and 39.18% and total polyphenols contents ranging between 2,643.69 and 4,773.28 mg 100 g-1. Thus the species evaluated may be considered sources rich in proteins, carbohydrates and polyphenols; however it is important to determine the composition and concentration of amino acids, sugars and fatty acids present in the pollens. ï¿½ 2015, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo.

Validation and monitoring of pesticide residues in honey using QuEChERS and gas chromatographic analysis	A fast and simple multiresidue method for the analysis of the residues of 11 organochlorine (OC) compounds, four organophosphate (OP) compounds, four pyrethroid compounds, two herbicides, and one phenyl pyrazole pesticide in honey is presented. A useful and fast method for the separation of 22 pesticides from different organochlorine, organophosphate, and pyrethroid groups was modified and standardized using QuEChERS and GC-ECD system and used for the determination of pesticide residues in 30 samples of honey collected from the Hisar region of India. The proposed method is simple, rapid, and reliable where satisfactory recoveries were observed. The recovery values obtained at three fortification levels: 0.01, 0.25, and 0.50 mg kg-1 were within the range of recommended values (70–120%), with RSDs in general below < 20%. Among organochlorines, aldrin (0.093–0.282 mg kg-1) was detected in 16 samples followed by -HCH (0.018–0.126 mg kg-1) in nine samples. Chlorpyriphos methyl (0.032–0.083 mg kg-1) among the organophosphates was detected in 10 samples. Cypermethrin (0.162–0.610 mg kg-1) and bifenthrin (0.190–0.344 mg kg-1) among the pyrethroids were detected in two and three samples, respectively. ï¿½ 2016 International Bee Research Association.			2015-01-01
Flumethrin residue levels in honey from apiaries of China by high-performance liquid chromatography	A method for detection of flumethrin residue in honey by high-performance liquid chromatography was established. After n-hexane-dichloromethane (4:6, vol/vol) extraction, the honey samples were concentrated by rotary evaporation, purified by an Oasis HLB solid-phase extraction column, and detected using a UV detector at 267 nm. The interference of the matrix was greatly reduced by optimizing pretreatment conditions; thus, the minimal detection limit of cyhalothrin was 0.005 mg/kg, the average recovery was 80.8 to 96.8%, and the coefficient of variation was 0.6 to 1.5%. The precision and reproducibility of this method was suitable and applicable for detecting flumethrin residue in honey. With this method, 135 honey samples from seven locations in the People's Republic of China were tested; 77 samples tested positive for flumethrin residue, resulting in a detection rate of 75.3%. Samples from the Guangdong province had the highest flumethrin residue level (0.122 mg/kg) of the locations tested. On the basis of analytical validation, the high-performance liquid chromatography has been shown to be a promising alternative for the analysis of flumethrin residue in honey samples.

Genome sequence heterogeneity of Lake Sinai Virus found in honey bees and Orf1/RdRP-based polymorphisms in a single host	Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are susceptible to a wide range of pathogens, including a broad set of viruses. Recently, next-generation sequencing has expanded the list of viruses with, for instance, two strains of Lake Sinai Virus. Soon after its discovery in the USA, LSV was also discovered in other countries and in other hosts. In the present study, we assemble four almost complete LSV genomes, and show that there is remarkable sequence heterogeneity based on the Orf1, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and capsid protein sequences in comparison to the previously identified LSV 1 and 2 strains. Phylogenetic analyses of LSV sequences obtained from single honey bee specimens further revealed that up to three distinctive clades could be present in a single bee. Such superinfections have not previously been identified for other honey bee viruses. In a search for the putative routes of LSV transmission, we were able to demonstrate the presence of LSV in pollen pellets and in Varroa destructor mites. However, negative-strand analyses demonstrated that the virus only actively replicates in honey bees and mason bees (Osmia cornuta) and not in Varroa mites. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.		capsid protein, RNA directed RNA polymerase, RNA directed RNA polymerase, Article, controlled study, gene sequence, genetic heterogeneity, genetic polymorphism, genome analysis, honeybee, insect virus, Lake Sinai Virus, nonhuman, phylogeny, pollen, priority journal, Varroa destructor, virus genome, virus replication, virus strain, virus transmission, animal, bee, Belgium, classification, cluster analysis, DNA sequence, genetics, isolation and purification, mite, molecular genetics, RNA virus, sequence homology, virology, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Lily symptomless virus, Miridae, Osmia cornuta, Varroa, Varroa destructor, Animals, Bees, Belgium, Capsid Proteins, Cluster Analysis, Mites, Molecular Sequence Data, Phylogeny, Pollen, Polymorphism, Genetic, RNA Replicase, RNA Viruses, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Sequence Homology	2015-01-01
Environmental Effects on Superoxide Dismutase and Catalase Activity and Expression in Honey Bee	Understanding the cellular stress response in honey bees will significantly contribute to their conservation. The aim of this study was to analyze the response of the antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase in honey bees related to the presence of toxic metals in different habitats. Three locations were selected: (i) Tunovo on the mountain Golija, as control area, without industry and large human impact, (ii) Belgrade as urban area, and (iii) Zajača, as mining and industrial zone. Our results showed that the concentrations of lead (Pb) in whole body of bees vary according to habitat, but there was very significant increase of Pb in bees from investigated industrial area. Bees from urban and industrial area had increased expression of both Sod1 and Cat genes, suggesting adaptation to increased oxidative stress. However, in spite increased gene expression, the enzyme activity of catalase was lower in bees from industrial area suggesting inhibitory effect of Pb on catalase. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.		catalase, lead, superoxide dismutase, zinc, adverse effects, animal, bee, city, environmental exposure, enzymology, female, gene expression profiling, genetics, industry, oxidative stress, Serbia, Animals, Bees, Catalase, Cities, Environmental Exposure, Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Industry, Lead, Oxidative Stress, Serbia, Superoxide Dismutase, Zinc	2015-01-01
Microbiota associated with pollen, bee bread, larvae and adults of solitary bee Osmia cornuta (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae)	Using cultivation-dependant method, we isolated 184 strains from fresh and old bee bread, pollen, larvae and adults of solitary bee Osmia cornuta. The 16S rDNA sequencing of 79 selected isolates gave the final species-specific identification of strains. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that microbiota isolated from five different sources were represented with 29 species within three different phyla, Firmicutes with 25 species, Actinobacteria with only one species and Proteobacteria with three species of Enterobacteriaceae. Bacterial biodiversity presented with Shannon-Wiener index (H′) was highest in the alimentary tract of adults and old bee bread (H′ = 2.43 and H′ = 2.53, respectively) and in the same time no dominance of any species was scored. On the contrary, results obtained for Simpson index (D) showed that in pollen samples the dominant species was Pantoea agglomerans (D = 0.42) while in fresh bee bread that was Staphylococcus sp. (D = 0.27). We assume that microbial diversity detected in the tested samples of solitary bee O. cornuta probably come from environment. © Cambridge University Press 2015.		adult, bacterium, bee, biodiversity, dominance, identification method, larva, microorganism, phylogenetics, pollen, species diversity, Actinobacteria, Apoidea, Bacteria (microorganisms), Enterobacteriaceae, Firmicutes, Hymenoptera, Megachilidae, Osmia cornuta, Pantoea agglomerans, Proteobacteria, Staphylococcus sp., bacterial DNA, propolis, animal, bacterium, bee, genetics, genotype, isolation and purification, larva, microbiology, pollen, Animals, Bacteria, Bees, DNA, Bacterial, Genotype, Larva, Pollen, Propolis	2015-01-01
Within-host competition among the honey bees pathogens Nosema ceranae and Deformed wing virus is asymmetric and to the disadvantage of the virus	Two pathogens co-infecting a common host can either interact positively (facilitation), negatively (competition) or act independently. A correlative study has suggested that two pathogens of the honey bee, Nosema ceranae and Deformed wing virus (DWV), interact negatively within a host (Costa et al., 2011). To test this hypothesis, we sequentially co-infected honey bees with these pathogens in a reciprocally crossed experimental design. Prior establishment in the host ventriculus by N. ceranae inhibited DWV while prior infection by DWV did not impact N. ceranae, highlighting an asymmetry in the competitive interaction between these emerging pathogens. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Honeybees and the law: Protecting our pollinators	Honeybees are a valuable asset to our agricultural systems and our wildlife. Populations are diminishing, and scientists are finding many reasons why. Now that science is providing answers, the law must provide protection. This Article provides an overview of the factors contributing to colony collapse disorder and proposes solutions involving the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and livestock law.

An economic valuation of biotic pollination services in Georgia	As agriculture faces documented decline in bees and other insect pollinators, empirical assessments of potential economic losses are critical for contextualizing the impacts of this decline and for prioritizing research needs. For the state of Georgia, we show that the annual economic value of biotic pollinators is substantial-US$367 million, equivalent to 13 percent of the total production value of crops studied and 3 percent of the total production value of Georgia's agricultural sector. Our unique Geographic Information Systems analysis reveals an irregular pattern of vulnerability. While the Georgia counties displaying the highest economic values of pollination are clustered in southern Georgia, those with the highest dependency on pollinators in terms of their contribution to crop production value are more dispersed throughout the state. © The Authors 2015.

Bumble bees selectively use native and exotic species to maintain nutritional intake across highly variable and invaded local floral resource pools	1. Changes to plant community composition after invasion are well documented but how these shifts directly affect higher trophic levels is still poorly understood. One potentially important factor is the change in nutritional availability after an invasion. Shifts in nutrient availability could affect the nutrient intake of organisms that live in invaded habitats, causing reduced fecundity and survival. 2. The effects of the interaction among nutrient availability, selection, and diet on nutrient intake of a native bumble bee were examined. No nutritional differences were found between exotic and native pollen or collected and non-collected pollen in protein or amino acid content, suggesting that differences in nutrient intake from random are based on selection. 3. Nutrient intake was simulated when pollen was selected randomly across all available plant species and when selection was restricted to native plants only or exotic plants only using a permutation model and compared with observed collection. The results suggest that pollen collection is non-random and that selecting only native or exotic plants cannot provide the protein or amino acid intake observed. 4. These results may help to explain why the responses of native bees to exotic plants are so variable. If the exotic plants in a community can supply the necessary nutrients, bees may readily incorporate them into their diets, but if not, exotic plants may be avoided. © 2015 The Royal Entomological Society.		amino acid, bee, community composition, diet, fecundity, invasive species, native species, nutrient availability, nutrient uptake, nutritional status, plant community, plant-pollinator interaction, pollen, pollinator, protein, selection, survival, trophic level, Apoidea, Bombus (genus)	2015-01-01
Effect of oxalic acid on Nosema ceranae infection	Nosema ceranae is a honey bee pathogen parasitizing the ventricular epithelium and potentially causing colony death. The effect of 0.25. M oxalic acid solution administered to the bees in the form of sugar syrup was determined in laboratory and field trials. The spore numbers in an 8-day laboratory experiment were significantly lower when AO was administered (treated: 11.86 ± 0.94 s.e.×. 10^6; untreated: 30.64 ± 0.31 s.e.x. 10^6). When administered in autumn to free flying colonies twice, 3. weeks apart, the infection prevalence decreased in young (relative reduction of 53.8% ± 6.5 s.e.) and old bees (relative reduction of 44.4% ± 6.0 s.e.). Meanwhile increased prevalence in all the controls was detected (young and old bees: relative increase of 45.7% ± 22.8 s.e. and 10.2% ± 5.9 s.e., respectively). While all the treated colonies overwintered correctly, the untreated ones did not (3 out of 5 were dead).In the absence of commercial products approved in several countries to control nosemosis, oxalic acid syrup appears promising in the development of alternative management strategies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.		oxalic acid, sugar, oxalic acid, age distribution, animal experiment, animal model, apiculture, Article, autumn, concentration response, controlled study, drug efficacy, field study, fungus spore, infection control, infection rate, nonhuman, nosemosis, prevalence, animal, bee, drug effects, host parasite interaction, microbiology, Nosema, season, Animals, Bees, Host-Parasite Interactions, Nosema, Oxalic Acid, Prevalence, Seasons	2015-01-01
Stakeholder mapping for the governance of biosecurity: a literature review	There is an increasing recognition that greater stakeholder engagement is needed in the assessment, management and communication of risks around plant and animal health, and biosecurity issues more generally. Despite a growing number of studies considering the knowledge and actions of stakeholders in the governance of biosecurity issues, attempts to systematically identify, categorise or analyse stakeholders in this field are relatively rare. This paper therefore integrates literature from a range of disciplines to generate methodological and theoretical insights that may enable decision-makers to effectively map and analyse biosecurity stakeholders, and enable more transparent, inclusive and adaptive governance of biosecurity. The review starts by defining key terms, before discussing some of the challenges and benefits of effectively representing stakeholders in biosecurity strategies. The paper then reviews a range of theoretical approaches to stakeholder mapping, before critically analysing alternative methods for stakeholder mapping and analysis, which could be used in biosecurity interventions. These theories and methods are then discussed in relation to biosecurity governance, drawing on recent applications of stakeholder mapping in biosecurity policy and practice. © 2015, Taylor & Francis.

Distribution, epidemiological characteristics and control methods of the pathogen Nosema ceranae Fries in honey bees Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera, Apidae)	Up until a few years ago, the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae was considered to be a pathogen of Apis cerana exclusively; however, only recently it has shown to be very virulent to Apis mellifera. Therefore, it has been named as apathogenic agent active in the disappearance of honey bee colonies globally, infecting all members of the colony. Honey bees are widely used for pollination and honey production, hence their importance in agriculture. They also play an important ecological role in plant pollination: a third of human food crops are pollinated by bees as well as many plants consumed by other animals. In this context, the object of this review is to summarise the information published by different authors on the geographical distribution and the morphological and genetic characteristics of this parasite, the symptomatology of the disease and the control methods used in those countries where N. ceranae is present, in order to identify better tools to confront this new bee disease.			2015-01-01
Pesticide-induced oxidative stress in laboratory and field populations of native honey bees along intensive agricultural landscapes in two Eastern Indian states	Pesticides have been cited as one of the major drivers of pollinator loss. However, little is known about pesticide impacts on natural populations of native honey bee species. This study looked into the effect of pesticides with respect to oxidative stress in the laboratory and in field populations of two native Indian honey bee species (Apis dorsata and A. cerana) by examining a combination of biomarkers, e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase and xanthine oxidase. A significant upregulation of all three biomarkers was observed in both treated individuals in laboratory experiments and field populations sampled from a pesticide use gradient. This study reports, for the first time, an increase in expression of xanthine oxidase in an invertebrate system (honey bees) exposed to pesticides. © 2014, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		agricultural land, biomarker, enzyme activity, honeybee, intensive agriculture, laboratory method, new record, oxidation, pesticide application, pollinator, India, Apis cerana, Apis dorsata, Apis mellifera, Invertebrata	2015-01-01
Effect of Lactobacillus johnsonii CRL1647 on different parameters of honeybee colonies and bacterial populations of the bee gut	Lactobacillus johnsonii CRL1647, isolated from the intestinal tract of a worker-bee in Salta, Argentina, was delivered to Apis mellifera L. honey bee colonies according to two different administration schedules: 1×105 cfu/ml every 15 days (2011) or monthly (2012). The effect of each treatment on the bee-colony performance was monitored by measuring honey production, and the prevalence of varroasis and nosemosis. Worker bees from each assay were randomly captured 3 days after administration and assayed for the following intestinal culturable and defined bacterial populations: total aerobic microorganisms, Bacillus spp. spores, Lactobacillus spp., Enterococcus spp. and enterobacteria. Interestingly, both treatments generated a similar increase in honey production in treated colonies compared to controls: 36.8% (every 15 days) and 36.3% (monthly). Nosema index always exhibited a reduction when lactobacilli were administered; in turn, Varroa incidence was lower when the lactobacilli were administered once a month. Moreover, the administration of L. johnsonii CRL1647 every 15 days produced an increase in the total number of aerobic microorganisms and in bacteria belonging to the genera Lactobacillus and Enterococcus; at the same time, a decrease was observed in the number of total spores at the end of the treatment. The number of enterobacteria was constant and remained below that of control hives at the end of the assay. On the other hand, the delivery of lactobacilli once a month only showed an increase in the number of bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus; meanwhile, viable counts of the remaining microorganisms assayed were reduced. Even though it seems that both treatments were similar, those bee colonies that received L. johnsonii CRL1647 every 15 days became so strong that they swarmed.

Task-related differential expression of four cytochrome P450 genes in honeybee appendages	In insects, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) contribute to phytochemical and pheromone clearance in chemoreception and xenobiotic detoxification in food processing. In eusocial species, P450 expression varies with anatomy and age-related behaviour. Adult honeybees (Apis mellifera) possess appendages differentially equipped for chemoreception; antennae and prothoracic and mesothoracic legs assess food and pheromone signals whereas metathoracic legs transport pollen over long distances. Newly eclosed bees and nurses remain in the hive and neither gather nor process food, whereas foragers collect pollen and nectar, thereby encountering phytochemicals. To understand the functions of cytochrome P450, family 4, subfamily G, polypeptide 11 (CYP4G11) in the honeybee genome, we compared its expression relative to worker age and task to expression of cytochrome P450, family 9, subfamily Q, polypeptides (CYP9Qs) known to metabolize xenobiotics. That CYP4G11 is highly expressed in forager antennae and legs, with highest expression in prothoracic and mesothoracic legs, is consistent with chemosensory perception, whereas weak expression of CYP4G11 in nurses suggests that it may process primarily exogenous rather than endogenous chemical signals. By contrast, and consistent with xenobiotic detoxification, the three CYP9Q transcripts were almost undetectable in newly eclosed workers and highest in foragers, with maximal expression in the metathoracic legs that closely contact pollen phytochemicals. These CYP4G11 expression patterns suggest a role in processing environmental signals, particularly those associated with food. © 2015 The Royal Entomological Society.		cytochrome P450, plant medicinal product, xenobiotic agent, age, animal, antenna (organ), bee, drug inactivation, enzymology, female, gene expression regulation, genetics, limb, metabolism, physiology, sensillum, Age Factors, Animals, Arthropod Antennae, Bees, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, Extremities, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Inactivation, Metabolic, Phytochemicals, Sensilla, Xenobiotics	2015-01-01
β-CD/ATP composite materials for use in dispersive solid-phase extraction to measure (fluoro)quinolone antibiotics in honey samples	A novel sorbent (β-CD/ATP composite) for dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) prepared by bonding β-cyclodextrin to modified attapulgite via silane coupling was used to determine the concentrations of four (fluoro)quinolones (Qs) in honey samples. The subsequent quantification of the Qs (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and gatifloxacin) was accomplished using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet detection after the d-SPE procedure. Parameters that may influence the extraction efficiency, such as type and volume of the eluent, type and amount of the sorbent, times of the vortex and sonication process, and pH of the sample, were investigated using batch and column procedures. The optimal experimental conditions (5mL sample at pH 3, 4mg of β-CD/ATP composite as the sorbent, 200μL of 40% ammonia in methanol as the eluent, with vortex time 60s and sonication time 6min, and no addition of salt) were obtained from this statistical evaluation. The limits of detection (LODs) were determined to the range from 0.30 to 3.95μgL-1. Good recoveries (83.6-88.6%) were obtained under the optimum conditions, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs), which are used to indicate reproducibility, were less than 7.4%. The method was validated with three real honey samples, and the results demonstrated that β-CD/ATP composite possessed a high adsorption capacity for Qs. Although the LODs were slightly higher than expected, this study confirmed the possibility of using cyclodextrin grafted palygorskite in analytical applications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Prospective Large-Scale Field Study Generates Predictive Model Identifying Major Contributors to Colony Losses	Over the last decade, unusually high losses of colonies have been reported by beekeepers across the USA. Multiple factors such as Varroa destructor, bee viruses, Nosema ceranae, weather, beekeeping practices, nutrition, and pesticides have been shown to contribute to colony losses. Here we describe a large-scale controlled trial, in which different bee pathogens, bee population, and weather conditions across winter were monitored at three locations across the USA. In order to minimize influence of various known contributing factors and their interaction, the hives in the study were not treated with antibiotics or miticides. Additionally, the hives were kept at one location and were not exposed to potential stress factors associated with migration. Our results show that a linear association between load of viruses (DWV or IAPV) in Varroa and bees is present at high Varroa infestation levels (>3 mites per 100 bees). The collection of comprehensive data allowed us to draw a predictive model of colony losses and to show that Varroa destructor, along with bee viruses, mainly DWV replication, contributes to approximately 70% of colony losses. This correlation further supports the claim that insufficient control of the virus-vectoring Varroa mite would result in increased hive loss. The predictive model also indicates that a single factor may not be sufficient to trigger colony losses, whereas a combination of stressors appears to impact hive health. © 2015 Kielmanowicz et al.		animal experiment, animal tissue, Article, bee, bioassay, Dicistroviridae, field study, nonhuman, Nosema ceranae, organism colony, population migration, prevalence, quantigene assay, seasonal variation, United States, Varroa destructor, virus load, virus replication, animal, bee, colony collapse, parasitology, prospective study, Varroidae, Virus Diseases, Acari, Apoidea, Deformed wing virus, Nosema ceranae, Varroa, Varroa destructor, Animals, Bees, Colony Collapse, Prevalence, Prospective Studies, Varroidae, Virus Diseases	2015-01-01
Impact of Varroa destructor on honeybee (Apis mellifera scutellata) colony development in South Africa	The devastating effects of Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman on European honeybee colonies (Apis mellifera L.) have been well documented. Not only do these mites cause physical damage to parasitised individuals when they feed on them, they also transmit viruses and other pathogens, weaken colonies and can ultimately cause their death. Nevertheless, not all honeybee colonies are doomed once Varroa mites become established. Some populations, such as the savannah honeybee, A. m. scutellata, have become tolerant after the introduction of the parasite and are able to withstand the presence of these mites without the need for acaricides. In this study, we measured daily Varroa mite fall, Varroa infestation rates of adult honeybees and worker brood, and total Varroa population size in acaricide treated and untreated honeybee colonies. In addition, honeybee colony development was compared between these groups in order to measure the cost incurred by Varroa mites to their hosts. Daily Varroa mite fall decreased over the experimental period with different dynamics in treated and untreated colonies. Varroa infestation rates in treated adult honeybees and brood were lower than in untreated colonies, but not significantly so. Thus, indicating a minimal benefit of treatment thereby suggesting that A. m. scutellata have the ability to maintain mite populations at low levels. We obtained baseline data on Varroa population dynamics in a tolerant honeybee over the winter period. Varroa mites appeared to have a low impact on this honeybee population, given that colony development was similar in the treated and untreated colonies. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

Potential for virus transfer between the honey bees Apis mellifera and A. Cerana	Viruses seem to play a key role in European honey bee, Apis mellifera health, and have a much broader host spectrum than previously thought. Few studies have investigated interspecific virus transfer within the genus Apis. The introduction of A. mellifera into Asia exposed endemic Apis species to the risk of obtaining new viruses or viral strains and vice versa. To investigate the potential for host shifts, virus prevalence and sequences were monitored over three years in single and mixed-species apiaries hosting introduced A. mellifera and endemic Apis cerana. Deformed wing virus (DWV), Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), black queen cell virus (BQCV), and sacbrood virus (SBV) were found, but not KBV, VDV-1, ABPV, or CBPV. Virus infections and prevalence were generally lower in A. cerana compared to A. mellifera, and varied over the years. The sequence data provided evidence for interspecific transfer of IAPV, BQCV, and DWV, but SBV strains seem to be species specific. Prevalence and sequence results taken together indicate that interspecific transfers of viruses are rare, even if honey bees are kept in close proximity. We discuss the pattern observed in the context host specificity and resistance. Our understanding of the extent of these exchanges is limited by a lack of knowledge on the mechanisms of adaptation of viruses to different hosts. ï¿½ 2016 International Bee Research Association.			2015-01-01
Quality of honeybee drones reared in colonies with limited and unlimited access to pollen	Older larvae of honeybee drones are fed with a diet containing pollen. It is not known how pollen deprivation during the larval development of drones might affect their reproductive quality. This study investigated ejaculation ability and semen quality in drones reared in colonies with limited (LP) and unlimited (ULP) access to pollen. Access to pollen was limited by pollen traps. Drone brood rearing was not instantly abandoned in colonies with limited access to pollen. Colonies from the LP group reared drones with smaller mass, which ejaculated in fewer numbers and released smaller amounts of semen. The LP and ULP groups did not differ in semen quality as judged by the concentration, number, and viability of spermatozoa in ejaculate. It was found that access to pollen during larval development directly affects the reproductive quality of drones. © 2014, The Author(s).		brood rearing, colony structure, diet, honeybee, larva, pollen, Apis mellifera	2015-01-01
Trace-level determination of pyrethroid, neonicotinoid and carboxamide pesticides in beeswax using dispersive solid-phase extraction followed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry	The aim of the work was to develop an analytical procedure able to quantify traces of 13 neonicotinoids and pyrethroids as well as carboxamide in beeswax at low levels (ng g−1) to evaluate the contamination. For this purpose, an efficient sample preparation procedure was developed based on solid–liquid extraction using dispersive diatomaceous earth and acetonitrile. This step was followed by a selective and sensitive analysis based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). This analytical procedure was validated based on International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. The limits of quantification ranged from 1 ng g−1 (thiamethoxam, clothianidin, imidacloprid, acetamiprid, thiacloprid and boscalid) to 40 ng g−1 (lambda-cyhalothrin). The method was then successfully applied to 60 samples of beeswax collected in several areas of France. The presence of thiacloprid, boscalid, imidacloprid and deltamethrin in beeswax was confirmed. The most frequently quantified pesticide was boscalid. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

The combined effects of miticides on the mating health of honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) queens	The honey bee, Apis mellifera L., plays a pivotal role in the US economy, contributing an estimated $17 billion annually, primarily through crop pollination. Despite their importance, the number of managed honey bee colonies available for pollination services has dropped dramatically during the last decade, threatening crop yields across the country. One of the main culprits of such declines is the varroa mite, Varroa destructor, a pest of honey bees that, when present in high numbers inside a hive, causes colonies to collapse and die. For almost 20 years, varroa mites have been controlled primarily with two in-hive miticides: the pyrethroid tau-fluvalinate (Apistan) and the organophosphate coumaphos (Checkmite+). Various studies have revealed that the exposure of honey bee colonies to sublethal levels of these chemicals can lead to colony-wide health problems. In this study, we looked at the combined effects of fluvalinate and coumaphos on the reproductive health of honey bee queens. We did so by raising queens in either miticide-free beeswax or beeswax containing known concentrations of both coumaphos and fluvalinate. Upon their emergence and successful mating, we took several standard measures of queen’s reproductive health. We found that queens reared in miticide-laden beeswax were not significantly smaller in size, but the spermatheca analysis showed significantly lower sperm counts and viability, and higher mating frequency, compared to queens reared in miticide-free beeswax. Our results indicate that exposure to miticides during development severely compromises queen’s reproductive health. Our findings also demonstrate the importance of the potentially detrimental combined effects of common in-hive miticides on colony health. ï¿½ 2016 International Bee Research Association.			2015-01-01
Influence of Honey Bee Genotype and Wintering Method on Wintering Performance of Varroa destructor (Parasitiformes: Varroidae)-Infected Honey Bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Colonies in a Northern Climate	The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a cooperative breeding program designed to enhance winter survival of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) when exposed to high levels of varroa (Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman) in outdoor-wintered and indoor-wintered colonies. Half of the colonies from selected and unselected stocks were randomly assigned to be treated with late autumn oxalic acid treatment or to be left untreated. Colonies were then randomly assigned to be wintered either indoors (n = 37) or outdoors (n = 40). Late autumn treatment with oxalic acid did not improve wintering performance. However, genotype of bees affected colony survival and the proportion of commercially viable colonies in spring, as indicated by greater rates of colony survival and commercially viable colonies for selected stock (43% survived and 33% were viable) in comparison to unselected stock (19% survived and 9% were viable) across all treatment groups. Indoor wintering improved spring bee population score, proportion of colonies surviving, and proportion of commercially viable colonies relative to outdoor wintering (73% of selected stock and 41% of unselected stock survived during indoor wintering). Selected stock showed better "tolerance" to varroa as the selected stock also maintained higher bee populations relative to unselected stock. However, there was no evidence of "resistance" in selected colonies (reduced mite densities). Collectively, this experiment showed that breeding can improve tolerance to varroa and this can help minimize colony loss through winter and improve colony wintering performance. Overall, colony wintering success of both genotypes of bees was better when colonies were wintered indoors than when colonies were wintered outdoors. © The Authors 2015.

Faustovirus-like asfarvirus in hematophagous biting midges and their vertebrate hosts	Faustovirus, a new Asfarviridae-related giant virus, was recently isolated in Vermamoeba vermiformis, a protist found in sewage water in various geographical locations and occasionally reported in human eye infection cases. As part of a global metagenomic analysis of viral communities existing in biting midges, we report here for the first time the identification and isolation of a Faustovirus-like virus in hematophagous arthropods and its detection in their animal hosts. The DNA virome analysis of three pools of Culicoides sp., engorged female Culicoides imicola and non-engorged male/female C. imicola biting midges collected in Senegal, revealed the presence of amoeba-infecting giant viruses and, among them, a majority of sequences related to Faustovirus. Phylogenetic analyses conducted on several structural genes of Faustovirus confirmed the clustering of the arthropod-borne Faustovirus with sewage-borne Faustoviruses, with a distinct geographical clustering of Senegalese Faustovirus strains. Transmission electron microscopy identified viral particles with morphologies and diameters which were compatible with Faustovirus. The presence of infectious arthropod-borne Faustovirus was finally confirmed by successful isolation on V. vermiformis amoeba. Global proteomic analysis of biting midges identified that arthropods' blood meal originating from cattle, rodents and humans. Further screening of cattle sera and rodent tissue resulted in prevalence of Faustovirus being estimated at 38% in rodents and 14% in cattle, suggesting a possible origin of Faustovirus presence in arthropods via the ingestion of contaminated blood meal. Viral loads were the highest in rodents' urine and kidney samples, suggesting a possible excretion of viral particles into the environment. Faustovirus DNA polymerase-related sequences were also detected in more than 9 and 11% of febrile patients and healthy Senegalese human sera, respectively. Our study thus, highlights the need to investigate the role of arthropods, wildlife, and domestic animals in the lifecycle of amoeba-infecting giant viruses and, in particular, the environmental cycle of Faustovirus. © 2015 Temmam, Monteil-Bouchard, Sambou, Aubadie-Ladrix, Azza, Decloquement, Bou Khalil, Baudoin, Jardot, Robert, La Scola, Mediannikov, Raoult and Desnues.

Willows (salix spp.) as pollen and nectar sources for sustaining fruit and berry pollinating insects	Willows (Salix spp.) are ubiquitous in the northern hemisphere, serving as an important pollen and nectar resource for insect pollinators and for the enhancement of insect-pollinated agricultural crops such as fruits and berries. We used a common-garden field test containing seven native North American willow species to assess attractiveness of male and female flower catkins by documenting visits of Andrena spp. (Apoidea: Anthophila), other wild bees (all native), and flower flies (Syrphidae). Most willows in Canada’s Maritimes begin flowering very early in spring, as the first wild pollinators become active following winter, and stop flowering by mid-May. A later-flowering group normally begins flowering in mid-May and stops flowering by mid-June. Pollinator species were largely opportunistic, visiting whatever species of willow flowers were available during foraging, but Andrena dunningi appeared to prefer flowers of S. nigra and S. interior. There was a general preference for male flower catkins, with 72% of Andrena spp. and 82% of all flower flies collecting pollen and/or nectar from male flowers, because pollen is the major component of nest provisioning for most solitary bees and the major source of protein used to develop reproductive tissues in most flower flies. Most andrenids and flower flies were collected within the April-June flowering period of six of the seven willow species studied, indicating that these willows could be used to support the pollinator community before the flowering period of commercially valuable flower-pollinated crops such as lowbush blueberry, cranberry, and apple. © 2015 (publisher name) All rights reserved.		bee, flowering, insect, nectar, Northern Hemisphere, plant community, pollination, North America, Andrena dunningi, Andrenidae, Apoidea, Hexapoda, Malus x domestica, Salix, Salix interior, Salix nigra, Syrphidae, Vaccinium angustifolium, Vaccinium macrocarpon	2015-01-01
In vitro effects of thiamethoxam on larvae of Africanized honey bee Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae)	Several investigations have revealed the toxic effects that neonicotinoids can have on Apis mellifera, while few studies have evaluated the impact of these insecticides can have on the larval stage of the honeybee. From the lethal concentration (LC50) of thiamethoxam for the larvae of the Africanized honeybee, we evaluated the sublethal effects of this insecticide on morphology of the brain. After determine the LC50 (14.34ng/μL of diet) of thiamethoxam, larvae were exposed to a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam equivalent to 1.43ng/μL by acute and subchronic exposure. Morphological and immunocytochemistry analysis of the brains of the exposed bees, showed condensed cells and early cell death in the optic lobes. Additional dose-related effects were observed on larval development. Our results show that the sublethal concentrations of thiamethoxam tested are toxic to Africanized honeybees larvae and can modulate the development and consequently could affect the maintenance and survival of the colony. These results represent the first assessment of the effects of thiamethoxam in Africanized honeybee larvae and should contribute to studies on honey bee colony decline. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Towards a better understanding of Apis mellifera and Varroa destructor microbiomes: Introducing 'phyloh' as a novel phylogenetic diversity analysis tool	The study of diversity in biological communities is an intriguing field. Huge amount of data are nowadays available (provided by the innovative DNA sequencing techniques), and management, analysis and display of results are not trivial. Here, we propose for the first time the use of phylogenetic entropy as a measure of bacterial diversity in studies of microbial community structure. We then compared our new method (i.e. the web tool phyloh) for partitioning phylogenetic diversity with the traditional approach in diversity analyses of bacteria communities. We tested phyloh to characterize microbiome in the honeybee (Apis mellifera, Insecta: Hymenoptera) and its parasitic mite varroa (Varroa destructor, Arachnida: Parasitiformes). The rationale is that the comparative analysis of honeybee and varroa microbiomes could open new perspectives concerning the role of the parasites on honeybee colonies health. Our results showed a dramatic change of the honeybee microbiome when varroa occurs, suggesting that this parasite is able to influence host microbiome. Among the different approaches used, only the entropy method, in conjunction with phylogenetic constraint as implemented in phyloh, was able to discriminate varroa microbiome from that of parasitized honeybees. In conclusion, we foresee that the use of phylogenetic entropy could become a new standard in the analyses of community structure, in particular to prove the contribution of each biological entity to the overall diversity. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Honey as a reservoir of C. botulinum and a risk factor for infant botulism	Honey is a natural, sweet substance produced by honey bees Apis millifera. In spite of its antimicrobial properties, honey may contain certain microbes, most of which are harmless to humans. However, the presence of Clostridium botulinum in honey is considered a risk factor for infant botulism development. Infant botulism is a toxicoinfection occurring in infants under the age of one year, after C. botulinum spores consumption. This disease is extremely rare, however, in recent years there has been an increase in the number of infant botulism cases. According to CDC (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention) infant botulism constitutes 76% of all botulism cases and more than half occurs as a consequence of honey consumption. C. botulinum is easily transmitted from soil to blossom, pollen, surface of honey bees and then to honey. The Polish legal system states that any integral components cannot be excluded from honey during processing. However, it is impossible to eliminate the spores from honey without deactivating its enzymes or removing pollen. The EU together with CDC recommend that infants under one year of age should not be fed with honey. They obligate the companies to provide the consumer with the information about the risk of honey consumption by infants. In Poland, infant botulism is not registered, is underestimated and may be misdiagnosed as a sudden infant death syndrome. The producers of honey are not obligated to label honey with the proper information about the microbiological risk of its consumption by infants.

Bee declines driven by combined Stress from parasites, pesticides, and lack of flowers	Bees are subject to numerous pressures in the modern world. The abundance and diversity of flowers has declined; bees are chronically exposed to cocktails of agrochemicals, and they are simultaneously exposed to novel parasites accidentally spread by humans. Climate change is likely to exacerbate these problems in the future. Stressors do not act in isolation; for example, pesticide exposure can impair both detoxification mechanisms and immune responses, rendering bees more susceptible to parasites. It seems certain that chronic exposure to multiple interacting stressors is driving honey bee colony losses and declines of wild pollinators, but such interactions are not addressed by current regulatory procedures, and studying these interactions experimentally poses a major challenge. In the meantime, taking steps to reduce stress on bees would seem prudent; incorporating flower-rich habitat into farmland, reducing pesticide use through adopting more sustainable farming methods, and enforcing effective quarantine measures on bee movements are all practical measures that should be adopted. Effective monitoring of wild pollinator populations is urgently needed to inform management strategies into the future.		pesticide, pesticide, abundance, agrochemical, bee, climate change, detoxification, environmental stress, flower, immune response, nontarget organism, parasite, pesticide residue, pollinator, pollution exposure, population decline, quarantine, species diversity, wild population, bee, biodiversity, bumblebee, climate change, deterioration, diet, environmental monitoring, environmental stress, flower, honeybee, nesting, nonhuman, parasite, pathogenesis, pneumonic pasteurellosis, pollination, priority journal, Review, animal, drug effects, ecosystem, environmental exposure, environmental protection, flower, parasitology, physiological stress, physiology, pollination, population, procedures, species extinction, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Animals, Bees, Climate Change, Conservation of Natural Resources, Ecosystem, Environmental Exposure, Environmental Monitoring, Extinction, Biological, Flowers, Pesticides, Pollination, Population, Stress, Physiological	2015-01-01
Gut symbionts from distinct hosts exhibit genotoxic activity via divergent colibactin biosynthesis pathways	Secondary metabolites produced by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) or polyketide synthase (PKS) pathways are chemical mediators of microbial interactions in diverse environments. However, little is known about their distribution, evolution, and functional roles in bacterial symbionts associated with animals. A prominent example is colibactin, a largely unknown family of secondary metabolites produced by Escherichia coli via a hybrid NRPS-PKS biosynthetic pathway that inflicts DNA damage upon eukaryotic cells and contributes to colorectal cancer and tumor formation in the mammalian gut. Thus far, homologs of this pathway have only been found in closely related Enterobacteriaceae, while a divergent variant of this gene cluster was recently discovered in a marine alphaproteobacterial Pseudovibrio strain. Herein, we sequenced the genome of Frischella perrara PEB0191, a bacterial gut symbiont of honey bees and identified a homologous colibactin biosynthetic pathway related to those found in Enterobacteriaceae. We show that the colibactin genomic island (GI) has conserved gene synteny and biosynthetic module architecture across F. perrara, Enterobacteriaceae, and the Pseudovibrio strain. Comparative metabolomics analyses of F. perrara and E. coli further reveal that these two bacteria produce related colibactin pathway-dependent metabolites. Finally, we demonstrate that F. perrara, like E. coli, causes DNA damage in eukaryotic cells in vitro in a colibactin pathway-dependent manner. Together, these results support that divergent variants of the colibactin biosynthetic pathway are widely distributed among bacterial symbionts, producing related secondary metabolites and likely endowing its producer with functional capabilities important for diverse symbiotic associations. ï¿½ 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Effects of atrazine exposure on male reproductive performance in Drosophila melanogaster	Atrazine is a commonly utilized herbicide to control broadleaf weeds in the agricultural setting. It can, however, have negative effects on male reproductive performance in a variety of vertebrate species. Much less is known, however, about the effects of atrazine on invertebrates. In this study, we investigated the effects of several different concentrations of larval atrazine exposure on measures of reproductive performance in adult male Drosophila melanogaster. Atrazine exposure had significant effects on a male's mating ability and the number of eggs his partner laid when he was successful at mating. Exposed males also sired a smaller proportion of the offspring under competitive conditions when they were the first male to mate to a doubly mated female. Atrazine exposure had no measurable effect on a male's ability to prevent a mated female from mating to another male or on the proportion of offspring sired when the exposed males were the second male to mate. Exposure upregulated expression of one male reproductive gene, ovulin, but had no effect on expression of another, sex peptide. Exposed males produced and transferred more sex peptide protein to the female during mating but ovulin protein levels were not affected. In general, we observed non-monotonic responses such that the intermediate exposure levels showed the largest reduction in male reproductive performance. This study suggests that atrazine exposure affects male reproductive performance in insects and future studies should aim to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the fitness effects of exposure. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.		atrazine, ecotoxicology, fitness, fly, gene expression, molecular analysis, pollution exposure, sexual selection, sperm competition, Drosophila melanogaster, atrazine, Drosophila protein, herbicide, animal, chemistry, Drosophila melanogaster, drug effects, female, gene expression, larva, male, metabolism, physiology, reproduction, secretion (process), sexual behavior, sperm, Animals, Atrazine, Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila Proteins, Female, Gene Expression, Herbicides, Larva, Male, Reproduction, Semen, Sexual Behavior, Animal	2015-01-01
Picornavirus RNA polyadenylation by 3D&lt;sup&gt;pol&lt;/sup&gt;, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase	Poly(A) tails are functionally important features of all picornavirus RNA genomes. Some viruses have genomes with relatively short poly(A) tails (encephalomyocarditis virus) whereas others have genomes with longer poly(A) tails (polioviruses and rhinoviruses). Here we review the polyadenylation of picornavirus RNA as it relates to the structure and function of 3Dpol. Poliovirus 3Dpol uses template-dependent reiterative transcription mechanisms as it replicates the poly(A) tails of viral RNA (Steil et al., 2010). These mechanisms are analogous to those involved in the polyadenylation of vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus mRNAs. 3Dpol residues intimately associated with viral RNA templates and products regulate the size of poly(A) tails in viral RNA (Kempf et al., 2013). Consistent with their ancient evolutionary origins, picornavirus 3Dpol and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) share structural and functional features. Structurally, both 3Dpol and TERT assume a "right-hand" conformation with thumb, palm and fingers domains encircling templates and products. Functionally, both 3Dpol and TERT use template-dependent reiterative transcription mechanisms to synthesize repetitive sequences: poly(A) tails in the case of picornavirus RNA genomes and DNA telomeres in the case of eukaryotic chromosomes. Thus, picornaviruses and their eukaryotic hosts (humans and animals) maintain the 3' ends of their respective genomes via evolutionarily related mechanisms. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.		polyadenylated RNA, RNA directed RNA polymerase, telomerase reverse transcriptase, virus messenger RNA, virus RNA, RNA directed RNA polymerase, virus RNA, Article, enzyme structure, genetic transcription, Influenza virus, nonhuman, Picornaviridae, polyadenylation, priority journal, RNA replication, RNA structure, telomere, Vesiculovirus, virus genome, virus replication, chemistry, enzymology, metabolism, molecular model, Picornaviridae, protein conformation, Animalia, Encephalomyocarditis virus, Eukaryota, Orthomyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, Poliovirus, Rhinovirus, Vesicular stomatitis virus, Models, Molecular, Picornaviridae, Polyadenylation, Protein Conformation, RNA Replicase, RNA, Viral, Transcription, Genetic	2015-01-01
Bees under stress: Sublethal doses of a neonicotinoid pesticide and pathogens interact to elevate honey bee mortality across the life cycle	Microbial pathogens are thought to have a profound impact on insect populations. Honey bees are suffering from elevated colony losses in the northern hemisphere possibly because of a variety of emergent microbial pathogens, with which pesticides may interact to exacerbate their impacts. To reveal such potential interactions, we administered at sublethal and field realistic doses one neonicotinoid pesticide (thiacloprid) and two common microbial pathogens, the invasive microsporidian Nosema ceranae and black queen cell virus (BQCV), individually to larval and adult honey bees in the laboratory. Through fully crossed experiments in which treatments were administered singly or in combination, we found an additive interaction between BQCV and thiacloprid on host larval survival likely because the pesticide significantly elevated viral loads. In adult bees, two synergistic interactions increased individual mortality: between N.ceranae and BQCV, and between N.ceranae and thiacloprid. The combination of two pathogens had a more profound effect on elevating adult mortality than N.ceranae plus thiacloprid. Common microbial pathogens appear to be major threats to honey bees, while sublethal doses of pesticide may enhance their deleterious effects on honey bee larvae and adults. It remains an open question as to whether these interactions can affect colony survival. © 2014 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Virus infections of honeybees Apis mellifera	The health and vigour of honeybee colonies are threatened by numerous parasites (such as Varroa destructor and Nosema spp.) and pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, protozoa. Among honeybee pathogens, viruses are one of the major threats to the health and wellbeing of honeybees and cause serious concern for researchers and beekeepers. To tone down the threats posed by these invasive organisms, a better understanding of bee viral infections will be of crucial importance in developing effective and environmentally benign disease control strategies. Here we summarize recent progress in the understanding of the morphology, genome organization, transmission, epidemiology and pathogenesis of eight honeybee viruses: Deformed wing virus (DWV) and Kakugo virus (KV); Sacbrood virus (SBV); Black Queen cell virus (BQCV); Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV); Kashmir bee virus (KBV); Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV); Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV). The review has been designed to provide researchers in the field with updated information about honeybee viruses and to serve as a starting point for future research. © G.

Recovery of small rodent populations after population collapse	In this review we summarise published knowledge regarding small mammal population recovery following sudden population collapse, regardless as to whether the collapse is caused by natural or man-made events. We determine recovery mechanisms, recovery time and recovery rate, and suggest how to adapt and optimise current methods to regulate small mammal population size, for pest management and/or conservation. It is vital that the principles underlying the recovery mechanisms are known for both pest control and conservation to align management methods to either maintain animal numbers at a permanent minimum level or increase population size. Collapses can be caused naturally, as in the declining phase of multi-annual fluctuations and after natural disasters, or by man-made events, such as pesticide application. In general, there are three ways population recovery can occur: (1) in situ survival and multiplication of a small remaining fraction of the population; (2) immigration; or (3) a combination of the two. The recovery mechanism strongly depends on life history strategy, social behaviour and density-dependent processes in population dynamics of the species in question. In addition, the kind of disturbance, its intensity and spatial scale, as well as environmental circumstances (e.g. the presence and distance of refuge areas) have to be taken into account. Recovery time can vary from a couple of days to several years depending on the reproductive potential of the species and the type of disturbances, regardless of whether the collapse is man made or natural. Ultimately, most populations rebound to levels equal to numbers before the collapse. Based on current knowledge, case-by-case decisions seem appropriate for small-scale conservation. For pest control, a large-scale approach seems necessary. Further investigations are required to make sound, species-specific recommendations. © 2015 CSIRO.		adaptive management, conservation management, density dependence, disturbance, habitat conservation, immigration, life history trait, pest control, pesticide application, population decline, population size, population structure, refugium, rodent, rodenticide, social behavior, survival, Animalia, Mammalia, Rodentia	2015-01-01
Functionally structured genomes in lactobacillus kunkeei colonizing the honey crop and food products of honeybees and stingless bees	Lactobacillus kunkeei is the most abundant bacterial species in the honey crop and food products of honeybees. The 16 S rRNA genes of strains isolated from different bee species are nearly identical in sequence and therefore inadequate as markers for studies of coevolutionary patterns. Here, we have compared the 1.5Mb genomes of ten L. kunkeei strains isolated from all recognized Apis species and another two strains from Meliponini species. Agene flux analysis, including previously sequenced Lactobacillus species as outgroups, indicated the influence of reductive evolution. The genome architecture is unique in that vertically inherited coregenes are located near the terminus of replication, whereas genes for secreted proteins and putative host-adaptive traits are located near the origin of replication. We suggest that these features have resulted from agenome-wide loss of genes, with integrations of novel genes mostly occurring in regions flanking the origin of replication. The phylogenetic analyses showed that the bacterial topology was incongruent with the host topology, and that strains of the same microcluster have recombined frequently across the host species barriers, arguing against codiversification. Multiple genotypes were recovered in the individual hosts and transfers ofmobile elements could be demonstrated for strains isolated from the same host species. Unlike other bacteria with small genomes, short generation times and multiple rRNA operons suggest that L. kunkeei evolves under selection for rapid growth in its natural growth habitat. The results provide an extended framework for reductive genome evolution and functional genome organization in bacteria. © The Author(s) 2015.		bacterial protein, animal, bacterial genome, bee, classification, genetic recombination, genetics, genome size, horizontal gene transfer, Lactobacillus, microbiology, phylogeny, Animals, Bacterial Proteins, Bees, Gene Transfer, Horizontal, Genome Size, Genome, Bacterial, Lactobacillus, Phylogeny, Recombination, Genetic	2015-01-01
The formulation makes the honey bee poison	Dr. Fumio Matsumura's legacy embraced a passion for exploring environmental impacts of agrochemicals on non-target species such as bees. Why most formulations are more toxic to bees than respective active ingredients and how pesticides interact to cause pollinator decline cannot be answered without understanding the prevailing environmental chemical background to which bees are exposed. Modern pesticide formulations and seed treatments, particularly when multiple active ingredients are blended, require proprietary adjuvants and inert ingredients to achieve high efficacy for targeted pests. Although we have found over 130 different pesticides and metabolites in beehive samples, no individual pesticide or amount correlates with recent bee declines. Recently we have shown that honey bees are sensitive to organosilicone surfactants, nonylphenol polyethoxylates and the solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), widespread co-formulants used in agrochemicals and frequent pollutants within the beehive. Effects include learning impairment for adult bees and chronic toxicity in larval feeding bioassays. Multi-billion pounds of formulation ingredients like NMP are used and released into US environments. These synthetic organic chemicals are generally recognized as safe, have no mandated tolerances, and residues remain largely unmonitored. In contrast to finding about 70% of the pesticide active ingredients searched for in our pesticide analysis of beehive samples, we have found 100% of the other formulation ingredients targeted for analysis. These 'inerts' overwhelm the chemical burden from active pesticide, drug and personal care ingredients with which they are formulated. Honey bees serve as an optimal terrestrial bioindicator to determine if 'the formulation and not just the dose makes the poison'. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Honey bee toxicology	Insecticides are chemicals used to kill insects, so it is unsurprising that many insecticides have the potential to harm honey bees (Apis mellifera). However, bees are exposed to a great variety of other potentially toxic chemicals, including flavonoids and alkaloids that are produced by plants; mycotoxins produced by fungi; antimicrobials and acaricides that are introduced by beekeepers; and fungicides, herbicides, and other environmental contaminants. Although often regarded as uniquely sensitive to toxic compounds, honey bees are adapted to tolerate and even thrive in the presence of toxic compounds that occur naturally in their environment. The harm caused by exposure to a particular concentration of a toxic compound may depend on the level of simultaneous exposure to other compounds, pathogen levels, nutritional status, and a host of other factors. This review takes a holistic view of bee toxicology by taking into account the spectrum of xenobiotics to which bees are exposed. © 2015 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.

Physiological and Molecular Mechanisms of Nutrition in Honey Bees	Nutrition is one of the most influential environmental factors for development, function, and survival of all organisms. One of the central and most intriguing questions in social insect research is how nutrition and the environment can program the development of different reproductive castes. Since the honey bee, Apis mellifera, genome was sequenced in 2006, tremendous knowledge has been gained on how genomic biology and molecular mechanisms respond to nutrition. This review integrates insights gained from past and recent research on honey bee physiology, behaviour, developmental biology, genetics, and molecular biology. A wide range of topics are covered from nutrients and digestive enzymes, to molecular physiological signalling pathways, to feeding behaviour and nourishment, and to epigenetic mechanisms programming larval and adult development. Caste determination is the focus in larval development, and behavioural transition of adult workers is the focus in adult nutrition. A deeper understanding of social insects and their nutritional regulation at the genomic level is still needed. It is recommended that future work focus on dissecting the network and signalling pathways between epigenetic marks and endocrinological factors using the honey bee as an excellent model system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.			2015-01-01
Environmental fate and exposure; neonicotinoids and fipronil	 Systemic insecticides are applied to plants using a wide variety of methods, ranging from foliar sprays to seed treatments and soil drenches. Neonicotinoids and fipronil are among the most widely used pesticides in the world. Their popularity is largely due to their high toxicity to invertebrates, the ease and flexibility with which they can be applied, their long persistence, and their systemic nature, which ensures that they spread to all parts of the target crop. However, these properties also increase the probability of environmental contamination and exposure of nontarget organisms. Environmental contamination occurs via a number of routes including dust generated during drilling of dressed seeds, contamination and accumulation in arable soils and soil water, runoff into waterways, and uptake of pesticides by nontarget plants via their roots or dust deposition on leaves. Persistence in soils, waterways, and nontarget plants is variable but can be prolonged; for example, the half-lives of neonicotinoids in soils can exceed 1,000 days, so they can accumulate when used repeatedly. Similarly, they can persist in woody plants for periods exceeding 1 year. Breakdown results in toxic metabolites, though concentrations of these in the environment are rarely measured. Overall, there is strong evidence that soils, waterways, and plants in agricultural environments and neighboring areas are contaminated with variable levels of neonicotinoids or fipronil mixtures and their metabolites (soil, parts per billion (ppb)-parts per million (ppm) range; water, parts per trillion (ppt)-ppb range; and plants, ppb-ppm range). This provides multiple routes for chronic (and acute in some cases) exposure of nontarget animals. For example, pollinators are exposed through direct contact with dust during drilling; consumption of pollen, nectar, or guttation drops from seed-treated crops, water, and consumption of contaminated pollen and nectar from wild flowers and trees growing near-treated crops. Studies of food stores in honeybee colonies from across the globe demonstrate that colonies are routinely and chronically exposed to neonicotinoids, fipronil, and their metabolites (generally in the 1–100 ppb range), mixed with other pesticides some of which are known to act synergistically with neonicotinoids. Other nontarget organisms, particularly those inhabiting soils, aquatic habitats, or herbivorous insects feeding on noncrop plants in farmland, will also inevitably receive exposure, although data are generally lacking for these groups. We summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the environmental fate of these compounds by outlining what is known about the chemical properties of these compounds, and placing these properties in the context of modern agricultural practices. © The Author(s) 2014.		agricultural land, concentration (composition), environmental fate, fipronil, foliage, metabolite, nectar, neonicotinoid pesticide, persistence, pollinator, pollution exposure, runoff, seed treatment, soil pollution, toxicity, Animalia, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hexapoda, Invertebrata, Vertebrata, fipronil, insecticide, nicotinic agent, pyrazole derivative, soil, soil pollutant, water pollutant, agriculture, animal, chemistry, drug effects, insect, metabolism, plant, soil, soil pollutant, toxicity, water pollutant, Agriculture, Animals, Insecticides, Insects, Nicotinic Agonists, Plants, Pyrazoles, Soil, Soil Pollutants, Water Pollutants, Chemical	2015-01-01
A two year national surveillance for Aethina tumida reflects its absence in Spain	Background: The Small Hive Beetle (SHB) is considered one of the major threats to the long-term sustainability and economic success of honey bee colonies in Europe. The risk of introduction into the EU had been reported as moderate to high. Indeed, it has been recently reported an outbreak in the south of Italy. Here, the presence of Aethina tumida in beekeeping farms in Spain was evaluated using a previously described qPCR protocol. Findings: When hive debris from 398 colonies (collected in 2010 and 2011) was analysed, grouped by region, SHB were not detected in any of the samples, making it unnecessary to analyse the samples individually. Conclusion: The SHB free-status is shown. This epidemiological surveillance would appear to be useful to detect the possible future entry of this pathogen.

Neonicotinoid-contaminated puddles of water represent a risk of intoxication for honey bees	In recent years, populations of honey bees and other pollinators have been reported to be in decline worldwide. A number of stressors have been identified as potential contributing factors, including the extensive prophylactic use of neonicotinoid insecticides, which are highly toxic to bees, in agriculture. While multiple routes of exposure to these systemic insecticides have been documented for honey bees, contamination from puddle water has not been investigated. In this study, we used a multi-residue method based on LC-MS/MS to analyze samples of puddle water taken in the field during the planting of treated corn and one month later. If honey bees were to collect and drink water from these puddles, our results showed that they would be exposed to various agricultural pesticides. All water samples collected from corn fields were contaminated with at least one neonicotinoid compound, although most contained more than one systemic insecticide. Concentrations of neonicotinoids were higher in early spring, indicating that emission and drifting of contaminated dust during sowing raises contamination levels of puddles. Although the overall average acute risk of drinking water from puddles was relatively low, concentrations of neonicotinoids ranged from 0.01 to 63 μg/L and were sufficient to potentially elicit a wide array of sublethal effects in individuals and colony alike. Our results also suggest that risk assessment of honey bee water resources underestimates the foragers' exposure and consequently miscalculates the risk. In fact, our data shows that honey bees and native pollinators are facing unprecedented cumulative exposure to these insecticides from combined residues in pollen, nectar and water. These findings not only document the impact of this route of exposure for honey bees, they also have implications for the cultivation of a wide variety of crops for which the extensive use of neonicotinoids is currently promoted. © 2014 Samson-Robert et al.		atrazine, clothianidin, deethylatrazine, drinking water, metolachlore, neonicotinoid, pesticide, simazine, thiamethoxam, tiabendazole, unclassified drug, insecticide, nicotine, rain, water pollutant, Article, controlled study, environmental exposure, honeybee, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, nonhuman, pollinator, residue analysis, risk assessment, seasonal variation, spring, water analysis, water contamination, water sampling, water supply, animal, bee, chemistry, drug effects, toxicity, water pollutant, Apis mellifera, Animals, Bees, Insecticides, Nicotine, Rain, Risk Assessment, Water Pollutants	2014-12-01
Genomic analysis of the interaction between pesticide exposure and nutrition in honey bees (Apis mellifera)	Populations of pollinators are in decline worldwide. These declines are best documented in honey bees and are due to a combination of stressors. In particular, pesticides have been linked to decreased longevity and performance in honey bees; however, the molecular and physiological pathways mediating sensitivity and resistance to pesticides are not well characterized.We explored the impact of coumaphos and fluvalinate, the two most abundant and frequently detected pesticides in the hive, on genome-wide gene expression patterns of honey bee workers. We found significant changes in 1118 transcripts, including genes involved in detoxification, behavioral maturation, immunity, and nutrition. Since behavioral maturation is regulated by juvenile hormone III (JH), we examined effects of these miticides on hormone titers; while JH titers were unaffected, titers of methyl farnesoate (MF), the precursor to JH, were decreased. We further explored the association between nutrition- and pesticide-regulated gene expression patterns and demonstrated that bees fed a pollen-based diet exhibit reduced sensitivity to a third pesticide, chlorpyrifos. Finally, we demonstrated that expression levels of several of the putative pesticide detoxification genes identified in our study and previous studies are also upregulated in response to pollen feeding, suggesting that these pesticides and components in pollen modulate similar molecular response pathways.Our results demonstrate that pesticide exposure can substantially impact expression of genes involved in several core physiological pathways in honey bee workers. Additionally, there is substantial overlap in responses to pesticides and pollen-containing diets at the transcriptional level, and subsequent analyses demonstrated that pollen-based diets reduce workers' pesticide sensitivity. Thus, providing honey bees and other pollinators with high quality nutrition may improve resistance to pesticides. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.		diet, gene expression, genomics, honeybee, longevity, nutrient availability, pesticide resistance, pollution exposure, Apis mellifera, coumafos, fluvalinate, insecticide, nitrile, pyrethroid, animal, animal food, bee, diet, drug effects, gene expression regulation, genetic association, genetics, insect genome, physiology, Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena, Animals, Bees, Coumaphos, Diet, Gene Expression Regulation, Genome, Insect, Genome-Wide Association Study, Insecticides, Nitriles, Pyrethrins	2014-12-01
Response of the honey bee (Apis mellifera) proteome to Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) infection	Recent declines in honey bee (Apis mellifera L., 1758) populations worldwide have spurred significant research into the impact of pathogens on colony health. The role of the Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) on hive mortality has become of particular concern since being correlated with colony losses. However, the molecular interactions between IAPV and its host remain largely unknown. To investigate changes in host protein expression during IAPV infection, mass-spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics was used to compare IAPV-infected and healthy pupae. Proteins whose expression levels changed significantly during infection were identified and functional analysis was performed to determine host systems and pathways perturbed by IAPV infection. Among the A. mellifera proteins most affected by IAPV, those involving translation and the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway were most highly enriched and future investigation of these pathways will be useful in identifying host proteins required for infection. This analysis represents an important first step towards understanding the honey bee host response to IAPV infection through the systems-level analysis of protein expression. © 2014, National Research Council of Canada.

Pyrethroids differentially alter voltage-gated sodium channels from the honeybee central olfactory neurons	The sensitivity of neurons from the honey bee olfactory system to pyrethroid insecticides was studied using the patchclamp technique on central 'antennal lobe neurons' (ALNs) in cell culture. In these neurons, the voltage-dependent sodium currents are characterized by negative potential for activation, fast kinetics of activation and inactivation, and the presence of cumulative inactivation during train of depolarizations. Perfusion of pyrethroids on these ALN neurons submitted to repetitive stimulations induced (1) an acceleration of cumulative inactivation, and (2) a marked slowing of the tail current recorded upon repolarization. Cypermethrin and permethrin accelerated cumulative inactivation of the sodium current peak in a similar manner and tetramethrin was even more effective. The slow-down of channel deactivation was markedly dependent on the type of pyrethroid. With cypermethrin, a progressive increase of the tail current amplitude along with successive stimulations reveals a traditionally described use-dependent recruitment of modified sodium channels. However, an unexpected decrease in this tail current was revealed with tetramethrin. If one considers the calculated percentage of modified channels as an index of pyrethroids effects, ALNs are significantly more susceptible to tetramethrin than to permethrin or cypermethrin for a single depolarization, but this difference attenuates with repetitive activity. Further comparison with peripheral neurons from antennae suggest that these modifications are neuron type specific. Modeling the sodium channel as a multi-state channel with fast and slow inactivation allows to underline the effects of pyrethroids on a set of rate constants connecting open and inactivated conformations, and give some insights to their specificity. Altogether, our results revealed a differential sensitivity of central olfactory neurons to pyrethroids that emphasize the ability for these compounds to impair detection and processing of information at several levels of the bees olfactory pathway. © 2014 Kadala et al.		cypermethrin, permethrin, pyrethroid, tetramethrin, voltage gated sodium channel, insecticide, permethrin, pyrethroid, tetrodotoxin, voltage gated sodium channel, animal cell, antenna (organ), antennal lobe neuron, Article, controlled study, depolarization, honeybee, information processing, nerve cell stimulation, nonhuman, olfactory system, physical sensitivity, repolarization, sensory nerve cell, sodium current, animal, bee, cell culture, cytology, drug effects, kinetics, membrane potential, metabolism, olfactory receptor, patch clamp technique, physiology, Apis mellifera, Animals, Bees, Cells, Cultured, Insecticides, Kinetics, Membrane Potentials, Olfactory Receptor Neurons, Patch-Clamp Techniques, Permethrin, Pyrethrins, Tetrodotoxin, Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels	2014-11-12
The Microsporidian Polar Tube and Spore Wall	All of the members of the microsporidia possess a unique, highly specialized invasion mechanism that involves the polar tube and spore wall. This chapter reviews the data on the organization, structure, and function of this invasion organelle. The application of immunological and molecular techniques and recent genome sequencing data has resulted in the identification of multiple polar tube and spore wall proteins (SWPs). The interactions of these identified proteins in the formation and function of the polar tube and spore wall remain to be determined. Inside the spore, the polar tube is filled with material and is often termed the polar filament; however, this chapter uses the term polar tube to refer to this structure when it is within the spore as well as when it forms a hollow tube after germination and is found outside the spore. The chapter presents details on the spore activation and discharge. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.			2014-10-20
Honey bee hemocyte profiling by flow cytometr	Multiple stress factors in honey bees are causing loss of bee colonies worldwide. Several infectious agents of bees are believed to contribute to this problem. The mechanisms of honey bee immunity are not completely understood, in part due to limited information about the types and abundances of hemocytes that help bees resist disease. Our study utilized flow cytometry and microscopy to examine populations of hemolymph particulates in honey bees. We found bee hemolymph includes permeabilized cells, plasmatocytes, and acellular objects that resemble microparticles, listed in order of increasing abundance. The permeabilized cells and plasmatocytes showed unexpected differences with respect to properties of the plasma membrane and labeling with annexin V. Both permeabilized cells and plasmatocytes failed to show measurable mitochondrial membrane potential by flow cytometry using the JC-1 probe. Our results suggest hemolymph particulate populations are dynamic, revealing significant differences when comparing individual hive members, and when comparing colonies exposed to diverse conditions. Shifts in hemocyte populations in bees likely represent changing conditions or metabolic differences of colony members. A better understanding of hemocyte profiles may provide insight into physiological responses of honey bees to stress factors, some of which may be related to colony failure. © 2014 Marringa et al.		animal cell, apoptosis, Article, blood cell, cell aggregation, cell membrane, cell membrane permeability, cell population, flow cytometry, fluorescence analysis, hemolymph, honeybee, host resistance, immune system, immunocompetent cell, microscopy, mitochondrial membrane potential, nonhuman, organism colony, plasma cell, Varroa destructor, animal, bee, blood cell, cytology, flow cytometry, fluorescence, honey, light, metabolism, mite, parasitology, physiology, procedures, radiation scattering, Apis mellifera, 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolocarbocyanine, benzimidazole derivative, carbocyanine, lipocortin 5, Animals, Annexin A5, Apoptosis, Bees, Benzimidazoles, Carbocyanines, Cell Aggregation, Cell Membrane Permeability, Flow Cytometry, Fluorescence, Hemocytes, Hemolymph, Honey, Light, Mites, Scattering, Radiation	2014-10-06
Parasitic and immune modulation of flight activity in honey bees tracked with optical counters	Host-parasite interactions are often characterized by changes in the host behaviour, which are beneficial to either the parasite or the host, or are a non-adaptive byproduct of parasitism. These interactions are further complicated in animal society because individual fitness is associated with group performance. However, a better understanding of host-parasite interaction in animal society first requires the identification of individual host behavioural modification. Therefore, we challenged honey bee (Apis mellifera) workers with the parasite Nosema ceranae or an immune stimulation and tracked their flight activity over their lifetime with an optic counter. We found that bees responded differently to each stress: both Nosema-infected and immune-challenged bees performed a lower number of daily flights compared with control bees, but the duration of their flights increased and decreased over time, respectively. Overall, parasitized bees spent more time in the field each day than control bees, and the inverse was true for immune-challenged bees. Despite the stress of immune challenge, bees had a survival similar to that of control bees likely because of their restricted activity. We discuss how those different behavioural modifications could be adaptive phenotypes. This study provides new insights into how biological stress can affect the behaviour of individuals living in society and how host responses have evolved. ï¿½ 2014.

The expanding family Marseilleviridae	The family Marseilleviridae encompasses giant viruses that replicate in free-living Acanthamoeba amoebae. Since the discovery of the founding member Marseillevirus in 2007, 7 new marseilleviruses have been observed, including 3 from environmental freshwater, one from a dipteran, and two from symptom-free humans. Marseilleviruses have ≈ 250-nm-large icosahedral capsids and 346-386-kb-long mosaic genomes that encode 444-497 predicted proteins. They share a small set of core genes with Mimivirus and other large and giant DNA viruses that compose a monophyletic group, first described in 2001. Comparative genomics analyses indicate that the family Marseilleviridae currently includes three lineages and a pan-genome composed of ≈ 600 genes. Antibodies against marseilleviruses and viral DNA have been observed in a significant proportion of asymptomatic individuals and in the blood and lymph nodes of a child with adenitis; these observations suggest that these giant viruses may be blood borne and question if they may be pathogenic in humans. • The family Marseilleviridae encompasses giant viruses that replicate in amoebae.• 7 marseilleviruses have been described, from freshwater, a dipteran, and humans.• Marseilleviruses have ≈ 250-nm-large capsids and 346-386-bp-long mosaic genomes.• Marseilleviruses share a small set of core genes with other "Megavirales" members.• Antibodies to marseilleviruses and marseillevirus DNA are detected in human blood. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Insecticides: Impact on the environment and human health	Insecticides have saved millions of human and animal lives since the date of their synthesis and use. They have played an important role that brought revolution in the field of agriculture and human health on control of insect pests of crops and vector-borne diseases. More than 80,000 chemical substances are now commercially available in agriculture and industry. About 4.6 million t of pesticides are applied into the environment and insecticides accounted for the largest portion of total use in the world to increase the productivity of food and fibre as well as to prevent the incidence of vector-borne diseases. Insects are the most successful group of animals existing in every segment of environment. They are polyphagous and migratory in nature, with high fecundity and short life span and diapausing (over-wintering) under adverse conditions. Food and fibre crops are damaged by more than 10,000 species of insects, with an estimated annual loss of 13.6∈% globally. In human health, more than 3,100 species of mosquitoes, vector of malaria, kill more than 1-3 million people annually. Approximately 40∈% of the world's population lives in areas at risk of malaria and every year about 500 million people become severely ill with malaria. Dengue, the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease, is estimated to cause 100 million infections each year, 250,000-500,000 of which are the cause of severe illness. Despite their importance, insecticides also have negative impact, like toxic residues in food, water, air and soil, resurgence and resistance of insect pests, and effect on non-target organisms. More than 645 species of insects and mites have developed resistance to insecticides with 542 species of arthropods resistant to at least one compound. About 7,470 cases of resistance have been reported in insects to a particular insecticide; 16 species of arthropods accounted for 3,237 (43∈%). The effects of insecticides on human health are more risky because of their exposure either directly or indirectly; yearly, more than 26 million people suffer from pesticide poisoning with nearly 220,000 deaths. Hundreds of millions of people are exposed to pesticides every year, primarily through agriculture: Globally, 36∈% of workers are employed in agriculture; this figure is rising to almost 50∈% in Southeast Asia and the Pacific and to 66∈% in sub-Saharan Africa. However, with all their hazards, the production of insecticides is continuously increasing in the international trade. Global pesticide use reached record sales of US$ 40 billion in 2008. We are continuously facing the challenges to decrease the incidence of insect pests and vectors to maintain a safe environment for future generations. Therefore, concerted global efforts shall be made to achieve this goal by safer alternatives. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. All rights are reserved.			2014-10-01
Production of the catechol type siderophore bacillibactin by the honey bee pathogen paenibacillus larvae	The Gram-positive bacterium Paenibacillus larvae is the etiological agent of American Foulbrood. This bacterial infection of honey bee brood is a notifiable epizootic posing a serious threat to global honey bee health because not only individual larvae but also entire colonies succumb to the disease. In the recent past considerable progress has been made in elucidating molecular aspects of host pathogen interactions during pathogenesis of P. larvae infections. Especially the sequencing and annotation of the complete genome of P. larvae was a major step forward and revealed the existence of several giant gene clusters coding for non-ribosomal peptide synthetases which might act as putative virulence factors. We here present the detailed analysis of one of these clusters which we demonstrated to be responsible for the biosynthesis of bacillibactin, a P. larvae siderophore. We first established culture conditions allowing the growth of P. larvae under ironlimited conditions and triggering siderophore production by P. larvae. Using a gene disruption strategy we linked siderophore production to the expression of an uninterrupted bacillibactin gene cluster. In silico analysis predicted the structure of a trimeric trithreonyl lactone (DHB-Gly-Thr)3similar to the structure of bacillibactin produced by several Bacillus species. Mass spectrometric analysis unambiguously confirmed that the siderophore produced by P. larvae is identical to bacillibactin. Exposure bioassays demonstrated that P. larvae bacillibactin is not required for full virulence of P. larvae in laboratory exposure bioassays. This observation is consistent with results obtained for bacillibactin in other pathogenic bacteria. © 2014 Hertlein et al.		bacillibactin, siderophore, unclassified drug, bacillibactin, oligopeptide, siderophore, virulence factor, Article, bacterial growth, bioassay, computer model, controlled study, dhb gene, gene, gene cluster, mass spectrometry, nonhuman, nucleotide sequence, Paenibacillus, Paenibacillus larvae, prediction, structure analysis, animal, bee, biosynthesis, chemistry, computer simulation, host pathogen interaction, metabolism, microbiology, Paenibacillus, pathogenicity, Apis mellifera, Paenibacillus larvae, Animals, Bees, Computer Simulation, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Mass Spectrometry, Oligopeptides, Paenibacillus, Siderophores, Virulence Factors	2014-09-19
Effects of neonicotinoids and fipronil on non-target invertebrates	We assessed the state of knowledge regarding the effects of large-scale pollution with neonicotinoid insecticides and fipronil on non-target invertebrate species of terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments. A large section of the assessment is dedicated to the state of knowledge on sublethal effects on honeybees (Apis mellifera) because this important pollinator is the most studied non-target invertebrate species. Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Lumbricidae (earthworms), Apoidae sensu lato (bumblebees, solitary bees) and the section “other invertebrates” review available studies on the other terrestrial species. The sections on freshwater and marine species are rather short as little is known so far about the impact of neonicotinoid insecticides and fipronil on the diverse invertebrate fauna of these widely exposed habitats. For terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate species, the known effects of neonicotinoid pesticides and fipronil are described ranging from organismal toxicology and behavioural effects to population-level effects. For earthworms, freshwater and marine species, the relation of findings to regulatory risk assessment is described. Neonicotinoid insecticides exhibit very high toxicity to a wide range of invertebrates, particularly insects, and field-realistic exposure is likely to result in both lethal and a broad range of important sublethal impacts. There is a major knowledge gap regarding impacts on the grand majority of invertebrates, many of which perform essential roles enabling healthy ecosystem functioning. The data on the few non-target species on which field tests have been performed are limited by major flaws in the outdated test protocols. Despite large knowledge gaps and uncertainties, enough knowledge exists to conclude that existing levels of pollution with neonicotinoids and fipronil resulting from presently authorized uses frequently exceed the lowest observed adverse effect concentrations and are thus likely to have large-scale and wide ranging negative biological and ecological impacts on a wide range of non-target invertebrates in terrestrial, aquatic, marine and benthic habitats. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014		concentration (composition), ecological impact, fipronil, freshwater ecosystem, insecticide, invertebrate, marine ecosystem, nontarget organism, risk assessment, sublethal effect, terrestrial ecosystem, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hexapoda, Invertebrata, Lepidoptera, Lumbricidae, Papilionoidea, fipronil, insecticide, nicotinic agent, pollutant, pyrazole derivative, animal, drug effects, ecosystem, invertebrate, pollination, pollutant, risk assessment, toxicity, Animals, Ecosystem, Environmental Pollutants, Insecticides, Invertebrates, Nicotinic Agonists, Pollination, Pyrazoles, Risk Assessment	2014-09-17
Holistic screening of collapsing honey bee colonies in Spain: A case study	Background: Here we present a holistic screening of collapsing colonies from three professional apiaries in Spain. Colonies with typical honey bee depopulation symptoms were selected for multiple possible factors to reveal the causes of collapse. Results: Omnipresent were Nosema ceranae and Lake Sinai Virus. Moderate prevalences were found for Black Queen Cell Virus and trypanosomatids, whereas Deformed Wing Virus, Aphid Lethal Paralysis Virus strain Brookings and neogregarines were rarely detected. Other viruses, Nosema apis, Acarapis woodi and Varroa destructor were not detected. Palinologic study of pollen demonstrated that all colonies were foraging on wild vegetation. Consequently, the pesticide residue analysis was negative for neonicotinoids. The genetic analysis of trypanosomatids GAPDH gene, showed that there is a large genetic distance between Crithidia mellificae ATCC30254, an authenticated cell strain since 1974, and the rest of the presumed C. mellificae sequences obtained in our study or published. This means that the latter group corresponds to a highly differentiated taxon that should be renamed accordingly. Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that the drivers of colony collapse may differ between geographic regions with different environmental conditions, or with different beekeeping and agricultural practices. The role of other pathogens in colony collapse has to bee studied in future, especially trypanosomatids and neogregarines. Beside their pathological effect on honey bees, classification and taxonomy of these protozoan parasites should also be clarified. © 2014Cepero et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.		animal, apiculture, bee, clinical trial, colony collapse, ecosystem, feeding behavior, genetics, host parasite interaction, host pathogen interaction, insect virus, isolation and purification, microbiology, multicenter study, Nosema, parasitology, pathogenicity, phylogeny, pollen, population dynamics, procedures, ribotyping, Spain, Trypanosomatidae, virology, Animals, Beekeeping, Bees, Colony Collapse, Ecosystem, Feeding Behavior, Host-Parasite Interactions, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Insect Viruses, Nosema, Phylogeny, Pollen, Population Dynamics, Ribotyping, Spain, Trypanosomatina	2014-09-15
Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry as a new approach to analyze neonicotinoid insecticides	This paper represents the first report of a capillary electrophoresis (CE) method compatible with mass spectrometry (MS) detection for simultaneously analyzing seven neonicotinoid insecticides (acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam). Different variables affecting CE separation (buffer concentration, pH, applied voltage and injection time) and MS detection (electrospray parameters) were studied. Low limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were achieved for all analytes, ranging from 1.0 to 2.3. μg/L, and from 3.5 to 7.2. μg/L, respectively. In addition, the proposed method showed itself to be linear in the range from LOQ to 1000. μg/L and to be precise, as the relative standard deviations of the migration times were lower than 4% in all cases. Finally, the proposed CE-MS method was applied to assess the efficacy of a beeswax cleaning treatment with oxalic acid to remove residues of three of the most commonly used neonicotinoids (clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam), use of which has recently been restricted by the European Union. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Determination of nonylphenol ethoxylate and octylphenol ethoxylate surfactants in beehive samples by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry	Nonylphenol and octylphenol ethoxylates (NP(EO)n and OP(EO) n) are major toxicants in agrochemicals used around beehives. Here we developed a LC-MS method for analysis of NP(EO)3-13 and OP(EO) 3-13 oligomers in bee hive matrices. Less than 2 g of honey, pollen or wax were extracted using the QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) approach. Recoveries for each oligomer in all matrices are between 75% and 111% at three spiked concentrations. The method proved to be rapid, precise and sensitive. Five honey, 10 pollen and 12 wax samples were collected and analysed. NP(EO)n was detected in every sample with concentrations ranging from 26 ppb to 10,239 ppb. Much higher NP(EO)n residues levels were found in wax followed by pollen than in honey. OP(EO)n concentrations on average were more than 10 times lower in pollen and wax. This method demonstrates a probable wide occurrence of alkylphenol ethoxylates in USA beehives. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An inventory of documented diseases of african honeybees	Current trends in global honeybee population changes have been linked to drastic declines in honeybee populations caused by complex interactions between pathogens, arthropod pests such as Varroa, pesticides, honeybee stress and habitat loss. Although substantial information exists for this sudden decline in honeybee populations in Europe and North America, in Africa the effect of this threat continues to draw debate. Despite recent reports showing the presence of V. destructor mites across the continent, knowledge on pathogens associated with bees and this mite in various parts of the continent is scanty. This review provides a comprehensive update on the documented diversity and geographic distribution of honeybee pathogens and points to the need of further information on these constraints of honeybee health.			2014-09-01
Assembly of recombinant israeli acute paralysis virus capsids	The dicistrovirus Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) has been implicated in the worldwide decline of honey bees. Studies of IAPV and many other bee viruses in pure culture are restricted by available isolates and permissive cell culture. Here we show that coupling the IAPV major structural precursor protein ORF2 to its cognate 3C-like processing enzyme results in processing of the precursor to the individual structural proteins in a number of insect cell lines following expression by a recombinant baculovirus. The efficiency of expression is influenced by the level of IAPV 3C protein and moderation of its activity is required for optimal expression. The mature IAPV structural proteins assembled into empty capsids that migrated as particles on sucrose velocity gradients and showed typical dicistrovirus like morphology when examined by electron microscopy. Monoclonal antibodies raised to recombinant capsids were configured into a diagnostic test specific for the presence of IAPV. Recombinant capsids for each of the many bee viruses within the picornavirus family may provide virus specific reagents for the on-going investigation of the causes of honeybee loss. © 2014 Ren et al.		protein ORF2, protein precursor, unclassified drug, capsid protein, recombinant protein, antibody specificity, article, codon, controlled study, Dicistroviridae, electron microscopy, electrophoresis, epitope mapping, fluorescence microscopy, honeybee, Israeli acute paralysis virus, morphology, nonhuman, nucleotide sequence, open reading frame, protein cleavage, protein expression, protein processing, protein purification, protein structure, sequence alignment, virus assembly, virus capsid, animal, bee, colony collapse, Dicistroviridae, genetics, metabolism, virology, virus capsid, Animals, Bees, Capsid, Capsid Proteins, Colony Collapse, Dicistroviridae, Recombinant Proteins	2014-08-25
On the Front Line: Quantitative Virus Dynamics in Honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) Colonies along a New Expansion Front of the Parasite Varroa destructor	Over the past fifty years, annual honeybee (Apis mellifera) colony losses have been steadily increasing worldwide. These losses have occurred in parallel with the global spread of the honeybee parasite Varroa destructor. Indeed, Varroa mite infestations are considered to be a key explanatory factor for the widespread increase in annual honeybee colony mortality. The host-parasite relationship between honeybees and Varroa is complicated by the mite's close association with a range of honeybee viral pathogens. The 10-year history of the expanding front of Varroa infestation in New Zealand offered a rare opportunity to assess the dynamic quantitative and qualitative changes in honeybee viral landscapes in response to the arrival, spread and level of Varroa infestation. We studied the impact of de novo infestation of bee colonies by Varroa on the prevalence and titres of seven well-characterised honeybee viruses in both bees and mites, using a large-scale molecular ecology approach. We also examined the effect of the number of years since Varroa arrival on honeybee and mite viral titres. The dynamic shifts in the viral titres of black queen cell virus and Kashmir bee virus mirrored the patterns of change in Varroa infestation rates along the Varroa expansion front. The deformed wing virus (DWV) titres in bees continued to increase with Varroa infestation history, despite dropping infestation rates, which could be linked to increasing DWV titres in the mites. This suggests that the DWV titres in mites, perhaps boosted by virus replication, may be a major factor in maintaining the DWV epidemic after initial establishment. Both positive and negative associations were identified for several pairs of viruses, in response to the arrival of Varroa. These findings provide important new insights into the role of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor in influencing the viral landscape that affects honeybee colonies. © 2014 Mondet et al.

Potential exposure of pollinators to neonicotinoid insecticides from the use of insecticide seed treatments in the mid-southern United States	Research was done during 2012 to evaluate the potential exposure of pollinators to neonicotinoid insecticides used as seed treatments on corn, cotton, and soybean. Samples were collected from small plot evaluations of seed treatments and from commercial fields in agricultural production areas in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee. In total, 560 samples were analyzed for concentrations of clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and their metabolites. These included pollen from corn and cotton, nectar from cotton, flowers from soybean, honey bees, Apis mellifera L., and pollen carried by foragers returning to hives, preplanting and in-season soil samples, and wild flowers adjacent to recently planted fields. Neonicotinoid insecticides were detected at a level of 1 ng/g or above in 23% of wild flower samples around recently planted fields, with an average detection level of about 10 ng/g. We detected neonicotinoid insecticides in the soil of production fields prior to planting at an average concentration of about 10 ng/g, and over 80% of the samples having some insecticide present. Only 5% of foraging honey bees tested positive for the presence of neonicotinoid insecticides, and there was only one trace detection (< 1 ng/g) in pollen being carried by those bees. Soybean flowers, cotton pollen, and cotton nectar contained little or no neonicotinoids resulting from insecticide seed treatments. Average levels of neonicotinoid insecticides in corn pollen ranged from less than 1 to 6 ng/g. The highest neonicotinoid concentrations were found in soil collected during early flowering from insecticide seed treatment trials. However, these levels were generally not well correlated with neonicotinoid concentrations in flowers, pollen, or nectar. Concentrations in flowering structures were well below defined levels of concern thought to cause acute mortality in honey bees. The potential implications of our findings are discussed. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

Parasite pressures on feral honey bees (Apis mellifera sp.)	Feral honey bee populations have been reported to be in decline due to the spread of Varroa destructor, an ectoparasitic mite that when left uncontrolled leads to virus build-up and colony death. While pests and diseases are known causes of large-scale managed honey bee colony losses, no studies to date have considered the wider pathogen burden in feral colonies, primarily due to the difficulty in locating and sampling colonies, which often nest in inaccessible locations such as church spires and tree tops. In addition, little is known about the provenance of feral colonies and whether they represent a reservoir of Varroa tolerant material that could be used in apiculture. Samples of forager bees were collected from paired feral and managed honey bee colonies and screened for the presence of ten honey bee pathogens and pests using qPCR. Prevalence and quantity was similar between the two groups for the majority of pathogens, however feral honey bees contained a significantly higher level of deformed wing virus than managed honey bee colonies. An assessment of the honey bee race was completed for each colony using three measures of wing venation. There were no apparent differences in wing morphometry between feral and managed colonies, suggesting feral colonies could simply be escapees from the managed population. Interestingly, managed honey bee colonies not treated for Varroa showed similar, potentially lethal levels of deformed wing virus to that of feral colonies. The potential for such findings to explain the large fall in the feral population and the wider context of the importance of feral colonies as potential pathogen reservoirs is discussed. © 2014 Thompson et al.

Impact of chronic neonicotinoid exposure on honeybee colony performance and queen supersedure	Background: Honeybees provide economically and ecologically vital pollination services to crops and wild plants. During the last decade elevated colony losses have been documented in Europe and North America. Despite growing consensus on the involvement of multiple causal factors, the underlying interactions impacting on honeybee health and colony failure are not fully resolved. Parasites and pathogens are among the main candidates, but sublethal exposure to widespread agricultural pesticides may also affect bees. Methodology/Principal Findings: To investigate effects of sublethal dietary neonicotinoid exposure on honeybee colony performance, a fully crossed experimental design was implemented using 24 colonies, including sister-queens from two different strains, and experimental in-hive pollen feeding with or without environmentally relevant concentrations of thiamethoxam and clothianidin. Honeybee colonies chronically exposed to both neonicotinoids over two brood cycles exhibited decreased performance in the short-term resulting in declining numbers of adult bees (-28%) and brood (-13%), as well as a reduction in honey production (-29%) and pollen collections (-19%), but colonies recovered in the medium-term and overwintered successfully. However, significantly decelerated growth of neonicotinoid-exposed colonies during the following spring was associated with queen failure, revealing previously undocumented long-term impacts of neonicotinoids: queen supersedure was observed for 60% of the neonicotinoid-exposed colonies within a one year period, but not for control colonies. Linked to this, neonicotinoid exposure was significantly associated with a reduced propensity to swarm during the next spring. Both short-term and long-term effects of neonicotinoids on colony performance were significantly influenced by the honeybees' genetic background. Conclusions/Significance: Sublethal neonicotinoid exposure did not provoke increased winter losses. Yet, significant detrimental short and long-term impacts on colony performance and queen fate suggest that neonicotinoids may contribute to colony weakening in a complex manner. Further, we highlight the importance of the genetic basis of neonicotinoid susceptibility in honeybees which can vary substantially. © 2014 Sandrock et al.		clothianidin, insecticide, thiamethoxam, unclassified drug, pesticide, adult, animal behavior, animal experiment, arthropod life cycle stage, article, brood parasite, controlled study, female, genetic association, genetic predisposition, honey, honeybee, insect development, insect swarm, long term exposure, nonhuman, organism colony, queen (insect), reproductive success, seasonal population dynamics, task performance, adverse effects, animal, animal food, bee, drug effects, environmental exposure, physiology, Animal Feed, Animals, Bees, Environmental Exposure, Pesticides	2014-08-01
Risk factors associated with the presence of Varroa destructor in honey bee colonies from east-central Argentina	Varroa destructor is considered one of the major threats for worldwide apiculture. Damage caused by varroa mite includes body weight loss, malformation and weakening of the bees. It was also suggested as the main cause associated with colony winter mortality and as an important vector for several honey bee viruses. Little is known about multiple factors and their interaction affecting V. destructor prevalence in apiaries from South America. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with V. destructor prevalence in east-central Argentina. Parasitic mite infestation level and colony strength measures were evaluated in 63 apiaries distributed in 4 different regions in east-central Argentina in a cross sectional study. Data regarding management practices in each apiary were collected by means of a questionnaire. A mixed-effects logistic regression model was constructed to associate management variables with the risk of achieving mite infestation higher than 3%. Colonies owned by beekeepers who indicated that they did not monitor colonies after mite treatment (OR=2.305; 95% CI: 0.944-5.629) nor disinfect hives woodenware material (OR=2.722; 95% CI: 1.380-5.565) were associated with an increased risk of presenting high intensity infestation with V. destructor (>3%). On the other hand, beekeepers who reported replacing more than 50% of the queens in their operation (OR=0.305; 95% CI: 0.107-0.872), feeding colonies protein substitute containing natural pollen (OR=0.348; 95% CI: 0.129-0.941) and feeding colonies High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) (OR=0.108; 95% CI: 0.032-0.364), had colonies that were less likely to have V. destructor infestations above 3%, than beekeepers who did not report using these management practices. Further research should be conducted considering that certain management practices were associated to mite infestation level in order to improve the sanitary condition in the colonies. Epidemiological studies provide key information to design surveillance programs against one the major threat to worldwide beekeeping. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Pesticides, food safety and integrated pest management	A rapidly growing human population has resulted in a demand for increased food production. In ancient times, traditional agriculture could meet human food needs when the size of human population was small. As human population grew, the demand for food increased, which was met by increasing the land area under cultivation. As the land resources became limited, efforts were made to increase productivity by fighting the losses inflicted by insects, weeds, and plant pathogens through the discovery of pesticides. At the same time, pesticides proved to be more dangerous due to their indiscriminate and excessive use, contaminating food (milk, honey, cereals, vegetables, and fruits) and the environment (ground water, soil, etc.), resulting in pest resistance, pest resurgence, and pest outbreaks. Consequently, the need arose for eco-friendly integrated pest management strategies to produce food safe from the negative impact of pesticide residues. The present chapter addresses information on the pesticide usage and their negative impacts on food safety leading to the development of integrated pest management (IPM). In this chapter, IPM for food safety through eco-friendly pesticides is discussed. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014. All rights are reserved.			2014-08-01
Honeybee colony disorder in crop areas: The role of pesticides and viruses	As in many other locations in the world, honeybee colony losses and disorders have increased in Belgium. Some of the symptoms observed rest unspecific and their causes remain unknown. The present study aims to determine the role of both pesticide exposure and virus load on the appraisal of unexplained honeybee colony disorders in field conditions. From July 2011 to May 2012, 330 colonies were monitored. Honeybees, wax, beebread and honey samples were collected. Morbidity and mortality information provided by beekeepers, colony clinical visits and availability of analytical matrix were used to form 2 groups: healthy colonies and colonies with disorders (n = 29, n = 25, respectively). Disorders included: (1) dead colonies or colonies in which part of the colony appeared dead, or had disappeared; (2) weak colonies; (3) queen loss; (4) problems linked to brood and not related to any known disease. Five common viruses and 99 pesticides (41 fungicides, 39 insecticides and synergist, 14 herbicides, 5 acaricides and metabolites) were quantified in the samples.The main symptoms observed in the group with disorders are linked to brood and queens. The viruses most frequently found are Black Queen Cell Virus, Sac Brood Virus, Deformed Wing Virus. No significant difference in virus load was observed between the two groups. Three acaricides, 5 insecticides and 13 fungicides were detected in the analysed samples. A significant correlation was found between the presence of fungicide residues and honeybee colony disorders. A significant positive link could also be established between the observation of disorder and the abundance of crop surface around the beehive. According to our results, the role of fungicides as a potential stressor for honeybee colonies should be further studied, either by their direct and/or indirect impacts on bees and bee colonies. © 2014 Simon-Delso et al.		acaricide, fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, pesticide, pesticide, acute toxicity, article, black queen cell virus, Chronic bee paralysis virus, colony collapse, controlled study, crop production, Deformed Wing Virus, Dicistroviridae, environmental exposure, environmental stress, geographical variation (species), honeybee, honeybee colony disorder, host pathogen interaction, insect virus, morbidity, mortality, nonhuman, organism colony, pesticide spraying, population abundance, queen (insect), Sac brood virus, virus concentration, virus detection, virus load, animal, bee, Belgium, chemically induced, colony collapse, crop, insect virus, virology, Animals, Bees, Belgium, Colony Collapse, Crops, Agricultural, Insect Viruses, Pesticides	2014-07-21
Diet-dependent gene expression in honey bees: Honey vs. sucrose or high fructose corn syrup	Severe declines in honey bee populations have made it imperative to understand key factors impacting honey bee health. Of major concern is nutrition, as malnutrition in honey bees is associated with immune system impairment and increased pesticide susceptibility. Beekeepers often feed high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) or sucrose after harvesting honey or during periods of nectar dearth. We report that, relative to honey, chronic feeding of either of these two alternative carbohydrate sources elicited hundreds of differences in gene expression in the fat body, a peripheral nutrient-sensing tissue analogous to vertebrate liver and adipose tissues. These expression differences included genes involved in protein metabolism and oxidation-reduction, including some involved in tyrosine and phenylalanine metabolism. Differences between HFCS and sucrose diets were much more subtle and included a few genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Our results suggest that bees receive nutritional components from honey that are not provided by alternative food sources widely used in apiculture.		corn syrup, insect protein, sucrose, animal, animal food, bee, diet, gene, gene expression regulation, genetics, honey, male, metabolism, nutritional requirement, Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena, Animals, Bees, Diet, Gene Expression Regulation, Genes, Insect, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Honey, Insect Proteins, Male, Nutritional Requirements, Sucrose	2014-07-17
Overview of Protection Goals for Pollinators	Protection goals reflect a certain level of information and certain values of a society. Regulatory authorities use risk assessment tools to determine whether the use of a pesticide is consistent with its general goal(s). Protection goals of a risk assessment are consistent with and support the general protection goal of "protecting human health and the environment". Protection of the pollinator community at the landscape level ensures pollination services and also contributes to the diversity of the species associated with pollination services within that landscape. Participants of the Workshop identified honey and other hive products as a potentially specific goal to be protected as well as a measure of honey bee health. In ecological risk assessments for wildlife, assessment endpoints have traditionally been defined as the growth, reproduction, and survival of an organism. © 2014 Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC).			2014-07-14
Assessing Exposure of Pesticides to Bees	An essential component of an ecological risk assessment is a prediction of exposure of the organisms being assessed. This chapter outlines exposure pathways for the different pesticide delivery methods, both nonsystemic and systemic, and discusses methods used to predict pesticide exposure to honey bees and non-Apis bees. It provides an outline of techniques employed to measure pesticide residues in relevant matrices and discusses higher tier field study designs that are used to refine bee exposure assessments for specific products. The chapter presents perspectives regarding pesticide application technologies that can be employed to mitigate bee exposure, as well as future research needs to further refine exposure assessments for this taxa. Workshop participants agreed that the most significant route of exposure to bees from foliar-applied pesticides is from both contact and oral exposure to contaminated pollen, nectar, and processed food. © 2014 Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC).			2014-07-14
Delayed and time-cumulative toxicity of imidacloprid in bees, ants and termites	Imidacloprid, one of the most commonly used insecticides, is highly toxic to bees and other beneficial insects. The regulatory challenge to determine safe levels of residual pesticides can benefit from information about the time-dependent toxicity of this chemical. Using published toxicity data for imidacloprid for several insect species, we construct time-to-lethal-effect toxicity plots and fit temporal power-law scaling curves to the data. The level of toxic exposure that results in 50% mortality after time t is found to scale as t 1.7 for ants, from t 1.6 to t 5 for honeybees, and from t 1.46 to t 2.9 for termites. We present a simple toxicological model that can explain t 2 scaling. Extrapolating the toxicity scaling for honeybees to the lifespan of winter bees suggests that imidacloprid in honey at 0.25 μ ... 1/4g/kg would be lethal to a large proportion of bees nearing the end of their life.		imidacloprid, imidazole derivative, insecticide, nitro derivative, imidazole derivative, insecticide, nitro derivative, animal, ant, bee, drug effects, Isoptera, larva, LD50, LD 50, toxicity, Animals, Ants, Bees, Imidazoles, Insecticides, Isoptera, Larva, Lethal Dose 50, Nitro Compounds	2014-07-04
Reviews of science for science librarians: An update on Honeybee Colony Collapse Disorder	Honeybee Colony Collapse Disorder (HCCD or CCD) is an epidemic in which worker bees mysteriously disappear from hives, despite the presence of a living queen and immature brood - the care and feeding of both being their ordinary preoccupation - and sometimes even despite the presence of ample supplies of stored honey that would sustain them. While it understandably has a great impact on honey production, the greatest significance of HCCD is its effects on tens of billions of dollars worth of crops that depend on bees to pollinate their flowers so as to have higher rates of seed or fruit set. A review of the literature done in 2008, covering journal articles up through 2007, disclosed a wide variety of potential causes for HCCD being put forth, largely in articles confined to the literature of entomology and apiology. This update, which covers 2008-2013, suggests that the number of factors still seriously implicated has actually diminished and that the majority of papers today favor multifactorial explanations, which now appear in much higher visibility journals in science, especially multiscience and microbiology. © 2014 Tony Stankus.

Pesticide residues in honeybees, honey and bee pollen by LC-MS/MS screening: Reported death incidents in honeybees	The aim of this study was to investigate reported cases of honeybee death incidents with regard to the potential interrelation to the exposure to pesticides. Thus honeybee, bee pollen and honey samples from different areas of Greece were analyzed for the presence of pesticide residues. In this context an LC-ESI-MS/MS multiresidue method of total 115 analytes of different chemical classes such as neonicotinoids, organophosphates, triazoles, carbamates, dicarboximides and dinitroanilines in honeybee bodies, honey and bee pollen was developed and validated. The method presents good linearity over the ranges assayed with correlation coefficient values r2≥0.99, recoveries ranging for all matrices from 59 to 117% and precision (RSD%) values ranging from 4 to 27%. LOD and LOQ values ranged - for honeybees, honey and bee pollen - from 0.03 to 23.3ng/g matrix weight and 0.1 up to 78ng/g matrix weight, respectively. Therefore this method is sufficient to act as a monitoring tool for the determination of pesticide residues in cases of suspected honeybee poisoning incidents. From the analysis of the samples the presence of 14 active substances was observed in all matrices with concentrations ranging for honeybees from 0.3 to 81.5ng/g, for bee pollen from 6.1 to 1273ng/g and for honey one sample was positive to carbendazim at 1.6ng/g. The latter confirmed the presence of such type of compounds in honeybee body and apicultural products. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Honey bee Apis mellifera parasites in the absence of Nosema ceranae fungi and Varroa destructor mites	Few areas of the world have western honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies that are free of invasive parasites Nosema ceranae (fungi) and Varroa destructor (mites). Particularly detrimental is V. destructor; in addition to feeding on host haemolymph, these mites are important vectors of several viruses that are further implicated as contributors to honey bee mortality around the world. Thus, the biogeography and attendant consequences of viral communities in the absence of V. destructor are of significant interest. The island of Newfoundland, Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, is free of V. destructor; the absence of N. ceranae has not been confirmed. Of 55 Newfoundland colonies inspected visually for their strength and six signs of disease, only K-wing had prevalence above 5% (40/55 colonies = 72.7%). Similar to an earlier study, screenings again confirmed the absence of V. destructor, small hive beetles Aethina tumida (Murray), tracheal mites Acarapis woodi (Rennie), and Tropilaelaps spp. ectoparasitic mites. Of a subset of 23 colonies screened molecularly for viruses, none had Israeli acute paralysis virus, Kashmir bee virus, or sacbrood virus. Sixteen of 23 colonies (70.0%) were positive for black queen cell virus, and 21 (91.3%) had some evidence for deformed wing virus. No N. ceranae was detected in molecular screens of 55 colonies, although it is possible extremely low intensity infections exist; the more familiar N. apis was found in 53 colonies (96.4%). Under these conditions, K-wing was associated (positively) with colony strength; however, viruses and N. apis were not. Furthermore, black queen cell virus was positively and negatively associated with K-wing and deformed wing virus, respectively. Newfoundland honey bee colonies are thus free of several invasive parasites that plague operations in other parts of the world, and they provide a unique research arena to study independent pathology of the parasites that are present. © 2014 Shutler et al.

Increased tolerance and resistance to virus infections: A possible factor in the survival of Varroa destructor-resistant honey bees (Apis mellifera)	The honey bee ectoparasitic mite, Varroa destructor, has a world-wide distribution and inflicts more damage than all other known apicultural diseases. However, Varroa-induced colony mortality is more accurately a result of secondary virus infections vectored by the mite. This means that honey bee resistance to Varroa may include resistance or tolerance to virus infections. The aim of this study was to see if this is the case for a unique population of mite-resistant (MR) European honey bees on the island of Gotland, Sweden. This population has survived uncontrolled mite infestation for over a decade, developing specific mite-related resistance traits to do so. Using RT-qPCR techniques, we monitored late season virus infections, Varroa mite infestation and honey bee colony population dynamics in the Gotland MR population and compared this to mite-susceptible (MS) colonies in a close by apiary. From summer to autumn the deformed wing virus (DWV) titres increased similarly between the MR and MS populations, while the black queen cell virus (BQCV) and sacbrood virus (SBV) titres decreased substantially in the MR population compared to the MS population by several orders of magnitude. The MR colonies all survived the following winter with high mite infestation, high DWV infection, small colony size and low proportions of autumn brood, while the MS colonies all perished. Possible explanations for these changes in virus titres and their relevance to Varroa resistance and colony winter survival are discussed. © 2014 Locke et al.		adult, animal experiment, animal model, Apis mellifera, article, autumn, black queen cell virus infection, controlled study, deformed wing virus infection, infection resistance, Kashmir bee virus infection, limit of detection, microbial population dynamics, nonhuman, organism colony, population size, quantitative analysis, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, sacbrood virus infection, seasonal variation, summer, Sweden, varroosis, virus detection, virus infection, virus survival, virus titration, animal, bee, parasitology, pathogenicity, Varroidae, virology, virus infection, Animals, Bees, Varroidae, Virus Diseases	2014-06-13
Mapping large-area landscape suitability for honey bees to assess the influence of land-use change on sustainability of national pollination services	Pollination is a critical ecosystem service affected by various drivers of land-use change, such as policies and programs aimed at land resources, market values for crop commodities, local land-management decisions, and shifts in climate. The United States is the world's most active market for pollination services by honey bees, and the Northern Great Plains provide the majority of bee colonies used to meet the Nation's annual pollination needs. Legislation requiring increased production of biofuel crops, increasing commodity prices for crops of little nutritional value for bees in the Northern Great Plains, and reductions in government programs aimed at promoting land conservation are converging to alter the regional landscape in ways that challenge beekeepers to provide adequate numbers of hives for national pollination services. We developed a spatially explicit model that identifies sites with the potential to support large apiaries based on local-scale land-cover requirements for honey bees. We produced maps of potential apiary locations for North Dakota, a leading producer of honey, based on land-cover maps representing (1) an annual time series compiled from existing operational products and (2) a realistic scenario of land change. We found that existing land-cover products lack sufficient local accuracy to monitor actual changes in landscape suitability for honey bees, but our model proved informative for evaluating effects on suitability under scenarios of land change. The scenario we implemented was aligned with current drivers of land-use change in the Northern Great Plains and highlighted the importance of conservation lands in landscapes intensively and extensively managed for crops.		apiculture, article, controlled study, crop production, environmental monitoring, environmental parameters, environmental protection, geographic distribution, honeybee, land use, landscape suitability, nonhuman, pollination, program sustainability, time series analysis, United States, animal, bee, ecosystem, environmental protection, physiology, satellite imagery, Animals, Bees, Conservation of Natural Resources, Ecosystem, North Dakota, Pollination, Satellite Imagery	2014-06-11
Propolis chemical composition and honeybee resistance against Varroa destructor	Propolis is known as honeybee chemical defence against infections and parasites. Its chemical composition is variable and depends on the specificity of the local flora. However, there are no data concerning the relationship between propolis chemical composition and honeybee colony health. We tried to answer this question, studying the chemical composition of propolis of bee colonies from an apiary near Avignon, which are tolerant to Varroa destructor, comparing it with colonies from the same apiary which are non-tolerant to the mites. The results indicated that non-tolerant colonies collected more resin than the tolerant ones. The percentage of four biologically active compounds - caffeic acid and pentenyl caffeates - was higher in propolis from tolerant colonies. The results of this study pave the way to understanding the effect of propolis in individual and social immunity of the honeybees. Further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between propolis chemical composition and honeybee colony health. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.		balsam, caffeic acid, propolis, resin, article, chemical composition, gas chromatography, health, honeybee, immunity, mass spectrometer, nonhuman, Varroa destructor, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Varroa, Varroa destructor, propolis, propolis constituents; Varroa destructor, Varroa-resistant colonies, Animals, Bees, Propolis, Varroidae	2014-06-03
Identifying suitable queen rearing sites of Apis mellifera mellifera at a regional scale using morphometrics	Honey bee decline in Europe has forced beekeepers to re-evaluate their management practices and breeding methods. Evidence suggests that the dark western honey bee (Apis mellifera mellifera) may be better adapted to the British climate, and consequently presents the potential for greater resistance to disease than other strains. Substantial hybridization of A. m. mellifera has taken place in Great Britain due to imports of subspecies from southern Europe (A. m. ligustica and A. m. carnica). This study evaluated the extent of hybridization at a regional scale in North Wales using morphometrics. By analysing honey bee wing venation and determining the cubital index (CI) and the discodial shift angle (DisA) the subspecies of each bee was determined. Analyses of 1830 wings from 61 colonies indicated a mean CI of 1.86 and a mean DisA of -0.37°. Most colonies consisted of hybrids of A. m. mellifera and A. m. ligustica with a slight predominance of A. m. mellifera traits. Across all 61 colonies, 43.2% of bee colonies presented A. m. mellifera traits, although this masked considerable variation between colonies (3% to 93%). Spatial analysis identified areas where queen release in breeding programmes would be expected to increase the predominance of A. m. mellifera traits. © IBRA 2014.			2014-05-30
The influence of genetic origin and its interaction with environmental effects on the survival of Apis Mellifera L. Colonies in Europe	The survival and performance of 597 honey bee colonies, representing five subspecies and 16 different genotypes, were comparatively studied in 20 apiaries across Europe. Started in October 2009, 15.7% of the colonies survived without any therapeutic treatment against diseases until spring 2012. The survival duration was strongly affected by environmental factors (apiary effects) and, to a lesser degree, by the genotypes and origin of queens. Varroa was identified as a main cause of losses (38.4%), followed by queen problems (16.9%) and Nosema infection (7.3%). On average, colonies with queens from local origin survived 83 days longer compared to non-local origins (p < 0.001). This result demonstrates strong genotype by environment interactions. Consequently, the conservation of bee diversity and the support of local breeding activities must be prioritised in order to prevent colony losses, to optimize a sustainable productivity and to enable a continuous adaptation to environmental changes. © IBRA 2014.			2014-05-30
Occurrence of parasites and pathogens in honey bee colonies used in a European genotypeenvironment Interactions experimentrs 2010/2011 and 2011/2012	Diseases are known to be one of the major contributors to colony losses. Within a Europe-wide experiment on genotype - environment interactions, an initial 621 colonies were set up and maintained from 2009 to 2012. The colonies were monitored to investigate the occurrence and levels of key pathogens. These included the mite Varroa destructor (mites per 10 g bees), Nosema spp. (spore loads and species determination), and viruses (presence/absence of acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) and deformed wing virus (DWV)). Data from 2010 to the spring of 2011 are analysed in relation to the parameters: genotype, environment, and origin (local vs. non-local) of the colonies in the experiment. The relative importance of different pathogens as indicators of colony death within the experiment is compared. In addition, pathogen occurrence rates across the geographic locations are described. © IBRA 2014.			2014-05-30
Environmental fate of soil applied neonicotinoid insecticides in an irrigated potato agroecosystem	Since 1995, neonicotinoid insecticides have been a critical component of arthropod management in potato, Solanum tuberosum L. Recent detections of neonicotinoids in groundwater have generated questions about the sources of these contaminants and the relative contribution from commodities in U.S. agriculture. Delivery of neonicotinoids to crops typically occurs as a seed or in-furrow treatment to manage early season insect herbivores. Applied in this way, these insecticides become systemically mobile in the plant and provide control of key pest species. An outcome of this project links these soil insecticide application strategies in crop plants with neonicotinoid contamination of water leaching from the application zone. In 2011 and 2012, our objectives were to document the temporal patterns of neonicotinoid leachate below the planting furrow following common insecticide delivery methods in potato. Leaching loss of thiamethoxam from potato was measured using pan lysimeters from three at-plant treatments and one foliar application treatment. Insecticide concentration in leachate was assessed for six consecutive months using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Findings from this study suggest leaching of neonicotinoids from potato may be greater following crop harvest in comparison to other times during the growing season. Furthermore, this study documented recycling of neonicotinoid insecticides from contaminated groundwater back onto the crop via high capacity irrigation wells. These results document interactions between cultivated potato, different neonicotinoid delivery methods, and the potential for subsurface water contamination via leaching. © 2014 Huseth, Groves.		ground water, insecticide, neonicotinoid, pesticide, surface water, thiamethoxam, unclassified drug, anabasine, ground water, insecticide, soil, water pollutant, agroecosystem, article, concentration (parameters), crop, environmental impact, growing season, harvest period, irrigation (agriculture), leaching, liquid chromatography, lysimetry, mass spectrometry, nonhuman, potato, recycling, soil, water contamination, analysis, analysis of variance, chemistry, insect control, irrigation (agriculture), parasitology, plant disease, prevention and control, procedures, tandem mass spectrometry, United States, water pollutant, Agricultural Irrigation, Anabasine, Analysis of Variance, Chromatography, Liquid, Groundwater, Insect Control, Insecticides, Plant Diseases, Soil, Solanum tuberosum, Tandem Mass Spectrometry, Water Pollutants, Chemical, Wisconsin	2014-05-13
Dynamics of the presence of israeli acute paralysis virus in honey bee colonies with colony collapse disorder	The determinants of Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), a particular case of collapse of honey bee colonies, are still unresolved. Viruses including the Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) were associated with CCD. We found an apiary with colonies showing typical CCD characteristics that bore high loads of IAPV, recovered some colonies from collapse and tested the hypothesis if IAPV was actively replicating in them and infectious to healthy bees. We found that IAPV was the dominant pathogen and it replicated actively in the colonies: viral titers decreased from April to September and increased from September to December. IAPV extracted from infected bees was highly infectious to healthy pupae: they showed several-fold amplification of the viral genome and synthesis of the virion protein VP3. The health of recovered colonies was seriously compromised. Interestingly, a rise of IAPV genomic copies in two colonies coincided with their subsequent collapse. Our results do not imply IAPV as the cause of CCD but indicate that once acquired and induced to replication it acts as an infectious factor that affects the health of the colonies and may determine their survival. This is the first follow up outside the US of CCD-colonies bearing IAPV under natural conditions. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.		article, colony collapse, controlled study, Dicistroviridae, dynamics, honeybee, immunoblotting, incidence, nonhuman, paralysis, real time polymerase chain reaction, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RNA extraction, seasonal variation, spectrophotometry, virus infectivity, virus replication, animal, bee, colony collapse, Dicistroviridae, isolation and purification, season, United States, virology, virus load, Animals, Bees, Colony Collapse, Dicistroviridae, Seasons, United States, Viral Load	2014-05-05
QuEChERS-based method for the multiresidue analysis of pesticides in beeswax by LC-MS/MS and GC×GC-TOF	The validation of an analytical procedure for the determination of pesticide residues in beeswax, an interesting matrix for environmental pollution monitoring, is presented. Using the QuEChERS template, the impacts of wax particle size, sample amount, and cleanup procedure (water addition, dispersive solid phase extraction, freeze-out, and combinations thereof) on extraction yield and coextractive load were studied. Sample preparation through liquid-liquid partitioning between acetonitrile and melted wax (∼80 °C), followed by freeze-out and primary-secondary amine dispersive cleanup, was performed on incurred and pesticide-free samples for 51 residues. Determinations were made through LC-MS/MS and GC×GC-TOF, and the whole procedure was validated. Matrix effects were evaluated, with recoveries between 70 and 120% and RSDs below 20% in almost all cases. LC-MS/MS LOQs ranged from 0.01 to 0.1 mg/kg for most pesticides, but for GC-amenable pesticides, GC×GC-TOF sensitivity was lower (0.1-0.2 mg/kg). This methodology can be applied for routine analysis of pesticide residues in beeswax. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

A draft genome of the honey bee trypanosomatid parasite crithidia mellificae	Since 2006, honey bee colonies in North America and Europe have experienced increased annual mortality. These losses correlate with increased pathogen incidence and abundance, though no single etiologic agent has been identified. Crithidia mellificae is a unicellular eukaryotic honey bee parasite that has been associated with colony losses in the USA and Belgium. C. mellificae is a member of the family Trypanosomatidae, which primarily includes other insect-infecting species (e.g., the bumble bee pathogen Crithidia bombi), as well as species that infect both invertebrate and vertebrate hosts including human pathogens (e.g.,Trypanosoma cruzi, T. brucei, and Leishmania spp.). To better characterize C. mellificae, we sequenced the genome and transcriptome of strain SF, which was isolated and cultured in 2010. The 32 megabase draft genome, presented herein, shares a high degree of conservation with the related species Leishmania major. We estimate that C. mellificae encodes over 8,300 genes, the majority of which are orthologs of genes encoded by L. major and other Leishmania or Trypanosoma species. Genes unique to C. mellificae, including those of possible bacterial origin, were annotated based on function and include genes putatively involved in carbohydrate metabolism. This draft genome will facilitate additional investigations of the impact of C. mellificae infection on honey bee health and provide insight into the evolution of this unique family.

Evaluation of the distribution and impacts of parasites, pathogens, and pesticides on honey bee (apis mellifera) populations in east Africa	In East Africa, honey bees (Apis mellifera) provide critical pollination services and income for small-holder farmers and rural families. While honey bee populations in North America and Europe are in decline, little is known about the status of honey bee populations in Africa. We initiated a nationwide survey encompassing 24 locations across Kenya in 2010 to evaluate the numbers and sizes of honey bee colonies, assess the presence of parasites (Varroa mites and Nosema microsporidia) and viruses, identify and quantify pesticide contaminants in hives, and assay for levels of hygienic behavior. Varroa mites were present throughout Kenya, except in the remote north. Levels of Varroa were positively correlated with elevation, suggesting that environmental factors may play a role in honey bee host-parasite interactions. Levels of Varroa were negatively correlated with levels of hygienic behavior: however, while Varroa infestation dramatically reduces honey bee colony survival in the US and Europe, in Kenya Varroa presence alone does not appear to impact colony size. Nosema apis was found at three sites along the coast and one interior site. Only a small number of pesticides at low concentrations were found. Of the seven common US/European honey bee viruses, only three were identified but, like Varroa, were absent from northern Kenya. The number of viruses present was positively correlated with Varroa levels, but was not correlated with colony size or hygienic behavior. Our results suggest that Varroa, the three viruses, and Nosema have been relatively recently introduced into Kenya, but these factors do not yet appear to be impacting Kenyan bee populations. Thus chemical control for Varroa and Nosema are not necessary for Kenyan bees at this time. This study provides baseline data for future analyses of the possible mechanisms underlying resistance to and the long-term impacts of these factors on African bee populations.©2014 Muli et al.		pesticide, pesticide, Africa, animal behavior, article, environmental impact assessment, honeybee, host parasite interaction, hygiene, Kenya, nonhuman, Nosema, organism colony, parasite control, parasite identification, parasite localization, parasite migration, population abundance, survival rate, Varroa, varroosis, virus identification, animal, bee, drug effects, environmental exposure, environmental protection, host pathogen interaction, parasitology, physiology, pollination, population dynamics, toxicity, Varroidae, Africa, Eastern, Animals, Bees, Conservation of Natural Resources, Environmental Exposure, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Pesticides, Pollination, Population Dynamics, Varroidae	2014-04-16
The bacterial communities associated with honey bee (apis mellifera) foragers	The honey bee is a key pollinator species in decline worldwide. As part of a commercial operation, bee colonies are exposed to a variety of agricultural ecosystems throughout the year and a multitude of environmental variables that may affect the microbial balance of individuals and the hive. While many recent studies support the idea of a core microbiota in guts of younger in-hive bees, it is unknown whether this core is present in forager bees or the pollen they carry back to the hive. Additionally, several studies hypothesize that the foregut (crop), a key interface between the pollination environment and hive food stores, contains a set of 13 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that inoculate collected pollen and act in synergy to preserve pollen stores. Here, we used a combination of 454 based 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the microbial communities of forager guts, crops, and corbicular pollen and crop plate counts to show that (1) despite a very different diet, forager guts contain a core microbiota similar to that found in younger bees, (2) corbicular pollen contains a diverse community dominated by hive-specific, environmental or phyllosphere bacteria that are not prevalent in the gut or crop, and (3) the 13 LAB found in culture-based studies are not specific to the crop but are a small subset of midgut or hindgut specific bacteria identified in many recent 454 amplicon-based studies. The crop is dominated by Lactobacillus kunkeei, and Alpha 2.2 (Acetobacteraceae), highly osmotolerant and acid resistant bacteria found in stored pollen and honey. Crop taxa at low abundance include core hindgut bacteria in transit to their primary niche, and potential pathogens or food spoilage organisms seemingly vectored from the pollination environment. We conclude that the crop microbial environment is influenced by worker task, and may function in both decontamination and inoculation.

Pesticide residues and bees - A risk assessment	Bees are essential pollinators of many plants in natural ecosystems and agricultural crops alike. In recent years the decline and disappearance of bee species in the wild and the collapse of honey bee colonies have concerned ecologists and apiculturalists, who search for causes and solutions to this problem. Whilst biological factors such as viral diseases, mite and parasite infections are undoubtedly involved, it is also evident that pesticides applied to agricultural crops have a negative impact on bees. Most risk assessments have focused on direct acute exposure of bees to agrochemicals from spray drift. However, the large number of pesticide residues found in pollen and honey demand a thorough evaluation of all residual compounds so as to identify those of highest risk to bees. Using data from recent residue surveys and toxicity of pesticides to honey and bumble bees, a comprehensive evaluation of risks under current exposure conditions is presented here. Standard risk assessments are complemented with new approaches that take into account time-cumulative effects over time, especially with dietary exposures. Whilst overall risks appear to be low, our analysis indicates that residues of pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides pose the highest risk by contact exposure of bees with contaminated pollen. However, the synergism of ergosterol inhibiting fungicides with those two classes of insecticides results in much higher risks in spite of the low prevalence of their combined residues. Risks by ingestion of contaminated pollen and honey are of some concern for systemic insecticides, particularly imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, chlorpyrifos and the mixtures of cyhalothrin and ergosterol inhibiting fungicides. More attention should be paid to specific residue mixtures that may result in synergistic toxicity to bees. © 2014 Sanchez-Bayo, Goka.		chlorpyrifos, cyhalothrin, ergosterol, fungicide, imidacloprid, insecticide, neonicotinoid, pesticide, pyrethroid, thiamethoxam, unclassified drug, pesticide residue, article, bumblebee, chemical interaction, chemical phenomena, contaminated organism, environmental exposure, honeybee, intoxication, nonhuman, pollen, prevalence, residue analysis, risk assessment, toxicity testing, animal, bee, diet, drug effects, honey, larva, LD50, physiology, risk assessment, risk factor, time, Animals, Bees, Diet, Environmental Exposure, Honey, Larva, Lethal Dose 50, Pesticide Residues, Pollen, Risk Assessment, Risk Factors, Time Factors	2014-04-09
Esterases of Varroa destructor (Acari: Varroidae), parasitic mite of the honeybee	Varroa destructor is an ectoparasite that causes serious damage to the population of the honeybee. Increasing resistance of the parasite to acaricides is related, among others, to metabolic adaptations of its esterases to facilitate decomposition of the chemicals used. Esterases are a large heterogeneous group of enzymes that metabolize a number of endogenous and exogenous substrates with ester binding. The aim of the present study was to determine the activity of esterases in the body extracts (BE) and excretion/secretion products (E/SP) of the mite. The enzymes contained in the E/SP should originate mainly from the salivary glands and the alimentary system and they may play a particularly important role in the first line of defence of the mite against acaricides. Activity of cholinesterases (ChEs) [acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase], carboxylesterases (CEs) and phosphatases [alkaline phosphatase (AP) and acid phosphatase (AcP)] was investigated. The activity of all the enzymes except AChE was higher in the E/SP than in the BE. ChEs from the BE and from the E/SP reacted differently on eserine, a ChE inhibitor. Eserine inhibited both enzymes from the BE, increased decomposition of acetylcholine, but did not influence hydrolysis of butyrylcholine by the E/SP. Activity of the CEs from the BE in relation to the esters of carboxylic acids can be presented in the following series: C10 > C12 > C14 > C8 > C2 > C4 = C16, while activity of the CEs from the E/SP was: C4 > C8 > C2 > C14 > C10 > C12 > C16. The inhibitor of CEs, triphenyl phosphate, reduced the activity of esterases C2-C8 and C14-C16; however, it acted in the opposite way to CEs C10 and C12. The activity of both phosphatases was higher in the E/SP than in the BE (AcP about twofold and AP about 2.6-fold); the activities of AP and AcP in the same material were similar. Given the role of esterases in resistance to pesticides, further studies are necessary to obtain complete biochemical characteristics of the enzymes currently present in V. destructor. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.		arthropod protein, esterase, animal, article, bee, drug effect, drug resistance, enzymology, metabolism, parasitology, physiology, Varroidae, Animals, Arthropod Proteins, Bees, Drug Resistance, Esterases, Varroidae	2014-04-01
Cephalaria transsylvanica-based flower strips as potential food source for bees during dry periods in European Mediterranean basin countries	The introduction of sown wildflower strips favours the establishment of pollinator communities, with special reference to social Apoidea. Here, we evaluated the late summer flowering Cephalaria transsylvanica as suitable species for strips providing food for pollinators in paucity periods. C. transsylvanica showed no particular requirements in terms of seed germination and growth during summer. This plant had an excellent potential of self-seeding and competitiveness towards weed competitors. C. transsylvanica prevented from entomophilous pollination showed inbreeding depression, with a decrease in seed-set and accumulation of seed energy reserves. However, C. transsylvanica did not appear to be vulnerable in terms of pollination biology since it had a wide range of pollinators including bees, hoverflies and Lepidoptera. C. transsylvanica was visited mainly by honeybees and bumblebees and these latter pollinators increased their visits on C. transsylvanica flowers during early autumn. This plant may be useful as an abundant source of pollen during food paucity periods, such as autumn. We proposed C. transsylvanica for incorporation into flower strips to be planted in non-cropped farmlands in intensively managed agricultural areas as well as in proximity of beehives. The latter option may facilitate the honeybees collecting pollen and nectar for the colony, thereby ensuring robustness to overcome the winter season. © 2014 Benelli et al.		angiosperm, article, autumn, bumblebee, Cephalaria transsylvanica, foraging, germination, honeybee, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, nectar, nonhuman, plant growth, plant insect interaction, pollen, pollination, pollinator, Southern Europe, summer, animal, bee, Caprifoliaceae, flower, growth, development and aging, insect, plant seed, pollination, reproduction, season, ultrastructure, Animals, Bees, Dipsacaceae, Flowers, Insects, Pollen, Pollination, Reproduction, Seasons, Seeds	2014-03-27
Transcriptome analyses of the honeybee response to Nosema ceranae and insecticides	Honeybees (Apis mellifera) are constantly exposed to a wide variety of environmental stressors such as parasites and pesticides. Among them, Nosema ceranae and neurotoxic insecticides might act in combination and lead to a higher honeybee mortality. We investigated the molecular response of honeybees exposed to N. ceranae, to insecticides (fipronil or imidacloprid), and to a combination of both stressors. Midgut transcriptional changes induced by these stressors were measured in two independent experiments combining a global RNA-Seq transcriptomic approach with the screening of the expression of selected genes by quantitative RT-PCR. Although N. ceranae-insecticide combinations induced a significant increase in honeybee mortality, we observed that they did not lead to a synergistic effect. According to gene expression profiles, chronic exposure to insecticides had no significant impact on detoxifying genes but repressed the expression of immunity-related genes. Honeybees treated with N. ceranae , alone or in combination with an insecticide, showed a strong alteration of midgut immunity together with modifications affecting cuticle coatings and trehalose metabolism. An increasing impact of treatments on gene expression profiles with time was identified suggesting an absence of stress recovery which could be linked to the higher mortality rates observed. © 2014 Aufauvre et al.		fipronil, imidacloprid, insecticide, transcriptome, trehalose, imidazole derivative, insecticide, nitro derivative, pyrazole derivative, transcriptome, animal experiment, article, carbohydrate metabolism, controlled study, cuticle, detoxification, environmental stress, gene expression, gene repression, genetic transcription, honeybee, immunity, midgut, mortality, nonhuman, Nosema, Nosema ceranae, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RNA sequence, animal, bee, drug effects, gene expression profiling, gene expression regulation, genetics, growth, development and aging, immunology, intestine, microbiology, Nosema, pathogenicity, Animals, Bees, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Imidazoles, Insecticides, Intestines, Mortality, Nitro Compounds, Nosema, Pyrazoles, Transcriptome	2014-03-19
Expression of varroa sensitive hygiene (VSH) in iranian honey bees (Apis mellifera meda)	In Iran honey bees cannot be kept without chemical treatments against Varroa destructor. The rich variety of native honeybee subspecies and ecotypes in Iran offers a good genetic resource for selection towards Varroa resistance. There are some examples of mite resistance that have developed because of natural selection in wild and managed Iranian populations. Researchers tested five commercial sources of honey bees, Apis mellifera meda in East Azarbaij an Province of Iran. Colonies from the five sources were measured for VSH and number of the fallen mites on the hive floor. The reduction of mite infestation in brood combs exposed to test colonies for 1 week differed significantly between groups. On average, colonies with natural low-level brood infestation reduced infestation by 26%. A positive correlation (Spearman coefficient) between Number of Fallen Mites per 1000 Bees (NFMB) with percentage of the mites that infested the brood (PMB) (r = 0.442* * p<0.01; n = 50) was found. Results of path analysis showed 53 and 14% of variation (standard deviation) in NFMB are because of percentage of the mites in phoretic phase (PMP) and PMB variables, respectively. This diversity offers rich potential genetic resources for selection on mite resistance. © Medwell Journals, 2014.			2014-03-10
Xenobiotic effects on intestinal stem cell proliferation in adult honey bee (Apis mellifera L) workers	The causes of the current global decline in honey bee health are unknown. One major group of hypotheses invokes the pesticides and other xenobiotics to which this important pollinator species is often exposed. Most studies have focused on mortality or behavioral deficiencies in exposed honey bees while neglecting other biological functions and target organs. The midgut epithelium of honey bees presents an important interface between the insect and its environment. It is maintained by proliferation of intestinal stem cells throughout the adult life of honey bees. We used caged honey bees to test multiple xenobiotics for effects on the replicative activity of the intestinal stem cells under laboratory conditions. Most of the tested compounds did not alter the replicative activity of intestinal stem cells. However, colchicine, methoxyfenozide, tetracycline, and a combination of coumaphos and tau-fluvalinate significantly affected proliferation rate. All substances except methoxyfenozide decreased proliferation rate. Thus, the results indicate that some xenobiotics frequently used in apiculture and known to accumulate in honey bee hives may have hitherto unknown physiological effects. The nutritional status and the susceptibility to pathogens of honey bees could be compromised by the impacts of xenobiotics on the maintenance of the midgut epithelium. This study contributes to a growing body of evidence that more comprehensive testing of xenobiotics may be required before novel or existing compounds can be considered safe for honey bees and other non-target species. © 2014 Forkpah et al.		colchicine, coumafos, fluvalinate, tetracycline, xenobiotic agent, broxuridine, xenobiotic agent, adult, animal cell, animal experiment, animal tissue, Apis mellifera, article, behavior change, cell division, cell nucleus, cell proliferation, controlled study, DNA replication, imago, intestinal stem cell, intestine crypt, intestine epithelium, long term exposure, midgut, nonhuman, stem cell, survival rate, worker (insect), animal, bee, cell proliferation, cytology, drug effects, honey, intestine, metabolism, social dominance, stem cell, Animals, Bees, Bromodeoxyuridine, Cell Nucleus, Cell Proliferation, Hierarchy, Social, Honey, Intestines, Stem Cells, Xenobiotics	2014-03-07
Nosema ceranae and RNA viruses in European and Africanized honeybee colonies (Apis mellifera) in Uruguay	Nosema ceranae is one of the causative agents of Nosemosis, a severe disease that affects the honeybee Apis mellifera. The aim of the present work was to compare N. ceranae and RNA virus infections in Africanized bees (hybrid of Apis mellifera scutellata and A. m. mellifera) and European (Italian) bees (A. m. ligustica) under field conditions. Africanized and Italian healthy colonies were relocated to an Eucalyptus grandis plantation, a place where colonies inevitably acquire Nosemosis. Fifteen and 30 days after that, all colonies presented N. ceranae spores although Africanized bees were less infected than Italian bees. Sacbrood virus (SBV) and Black queen cell virus (BQCV) were detected in both races of bees, although Africanized bees presented a lower level of BQCV infection than Italian bees. At the end of the flowering period, Africanized colonies had a larger honeybee population and produced more honey than Italian colonies. These results suggest that Africanized bees may be able to limit N. ceranae and BQCV infections within the colony, and that this may allow them to be more productive. © 2013 INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		disease severity, honeybee, infectious disease, monocotyledon, plantation, RNA, viral disease, virus, Uruguay	2014-03-01
A Causal Analysis of Observed Declines in Managed Honey Bees (Apis mellifera)	The European honey bee (Apis mellifera) is a highly valuable, semi-free-ranging managed agricultural species. While the number of managed hives has been increasing, declines in overwinter survival, and the onset of colony collapse disorder in 2006, precipitated a large amount of research on bees' health in an effort to isolate the causative factors. A workshop was convened during which bee experts were introduced to a formal causal analysis approach to compare 39 candidate causes against specified criteria to evaluate their relationship to the reduced overwinter survivability observed since 2006 of commercial bees used in the California almond industry. Candidate causes were categorized as probable, possible, or unlikely; several candidate causes were categorized as indeterminate due to lack of information. Due to time limitations, a full causal analysis was not completed at the workshop. In this article, examples are provided to illustrate the process and provide preliminary findings, using three candidate causes. Varroa mites plus viruses were judged to be a "probable cause" of the reduced survival, while nutrient deficiency was judged to be a "possible cause." Neonicotinoid pesticides were judged to be "unlikely" as the sole cause of this reduced survival, although they could possibly be a contributing factor. © 2014 Copyright ©Jane P. Staveley, Sheryl A.

Vespa velutina: A new invasive predator of honeybees in Europe	The yellow-legged hornet (Vespa velutina) is the first invasive Vespidae predator of honeybees to be accidentally introduced into Europe from Asia. In the current pollinator decline, V. velutina is an additional stressor for honeybees and other pollinators. Although V. velutina contributes to the loss of honeybee colonies, little is known about its biology and behaviour both in the native and in the invaded area. Here, we review the current knowledge of this species and describe its life cycle and life history traits (reproduction, overwintering, foraging and dispersal) in the light of the biology of other Vespidae. We also review the impact of this species on ecosystems, on the economics of beekeeping, and on human health (this species being potentially deadly for allergic people). Based on this information and on previous worldwide experiences with Vespidae invasions, we propose key research topics for the development of effective management plans. We identify methods to limit the impact and proliferation of V. velutina in Europe that are based on nest destruction, trapping, population genetics, and biological control. In our opinion, research effort on the means to detect and destroy V. velutina nests at an early stage is required in order to short-circuit the colony cycle and thus limit both its impact on honeybees and its expansion through Europe. Finally, we discuss the impact of this biological invasion on the development of methods that should be used to manage alien species in the future. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.			2014-03-01
Honey bee-infecting plant virus with implications on honey bee colony health	Honey bees are eusocial insects that are commercially managed to provide pollination services for agricultural crops. Recent increased losses of honey bee colonies (averaging 32% annually since 2006) are associated with the incidence and abundance of pathogens. In their study in mBio, J. L. Li et al. [mBio 5(1):e00898-13, 2014, doi:10.1128/mBio.00898-13] share their discovery that a plant virus, tobacco ring spot virus (TRSV), replicates in honey bees and that the prevalence of this virus was high in weak colonies. Their findings increase our understanding of the role of viruses in honey bee colony losses and underscore the importance of surveying for new and/or emerging viruses in honey bees. Furthermore, their findings will pique the interest of virologists and biologists across all disciplines. The discovery that a plant virus (TRSV) replicates, spreads, and negatively affects the health of an insect host will lead to additional studies on the mechanisms of host-specific adaptation and the role of crosskingdom infections in the transmission of this virus. © 2014 Flenniken.		article, gene sequence, honeybee, nonhuman, organism colony, phylogeny, Picornavirus, plant immunity, plant virus, population size, prevalence, priority journal, tobacco ring spot virus, viral plant disease, virus genome, virus replication, virus transmission, Animals, Bees, Nepovirus, Virus Replication	2014-02-25
Critical issues facing New Zealand entomology	Here, we identify current high-priority issues in New Zealand entomology. These 'critical issues' were defined by being of national entomological interest, and in urgent need of research or attention. The issues were derived in consultation with the Entomological Society of New Zealand members and as part of a workshop at the 62nd New Zealand Entomological Society Conference. We present a list of nine priority areas (presented here without any ranking priority). These areas are: 1. conserving indigenous invertebrate diversity; 2. limiting predator pressure exerted by exotic vertebrate predators; 3. limiting the effects of invasive invertebrates, especially Vespula wasps in honeydew beech forests; understanding the influence of pesticides and pathogens on honey bees; 4. maintaining and enhancing efficient biosecurity systems to keep out invasive pests and diseases; 5. enhancing support for taxonomy; 6. enhancing entomological teaching, training and support for entomology graduates; 7. utilising the hidden knowledge of retired entomologists; and 8. supporting amateurs in entomology. For each of these topics we briefly discuss the state of the current situation or knowledge gaps. We consider this a road map to enhance entomology in New Zealand. © 2014 The Entomological Society of New Zealand.			2014-02-25
Africanized honey bees (Apis mellifera) have low infestation levels of the mite Varroa destructor in different ecological regions in Mexico	Honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies of African and European descent were compared for levels of Varroa destructor infestation in 3 different ecological regions in Mexico. The 300 colonies that were studied were located in subtropical, temperate sub-humid, and temperate dry climates. The morphotype and mitotype of adult bees as well as their rates of infestation by varroa mites were determined. Additionally, the number of combs with brood and covered with bees was recorded for each colony. The highest frequency of colonies that were classified as African-derived was found in the subtropical environment, whereas the lowest occurred in the temperate dry region. Overall, the colonies of African genotype had significantly lower mite infestation rates (3.5 ± 0.34%) than the colonies of European genotype (4.7 ± 0.49%) regardless of the region sampled. Significant effects of genotype and region on Varroa infestation rates were evident, and there were no differences in bee population or capped brood between genotypes. Mite infestation levels were significantly lower in the colonies of the temperate dry region than in the colonies of the other 2 regions. These results are discussed within the context of results from studies that were previously conducted in Brazil. This is the first study that demonstrates the effects of Africanization and ecological environment on V. destructor infestation rates in honey bee colonies in North America. © FUNPEC-RP.		mitochondrial DNA, Africa, altitude, Apis mellifera, Article, climate, controlled study, ecology, genotype, infestation, Mexico, mitotype, morphometrics, morphotype, nonhuman, North America, organism colony, temperature, Varroa destructor, animal, bee, ecology, genetics, mite infestation, parasitology, tropic climate, Varroidae, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Varroa, Varroa destructor, Animals, Bees, Ecology, Mexico, Mite Infestations, Tropical Climate, Varroidae	2014-02-21
Effect of bodily fluids from honey bee (apis mellifera) larvae on growth and genome-wide transcriptional response of the causal agent of american foulbrood disease (Paenibacillus larvae)	Paenibacillus larvae, the causal agent of American Foulbrood disease (AFB), affects honey bee health worldwide. The present study investigates the effect of bodily fluids from honey bee larvae on growth velocity and transcription for this Gram-positive, endospore-forming bacterium. It was observed that larval fluids accelerate the growth and lead to higher bacterial densities during stationary phase. The genome-wide transcriptional response of in vitro cultures of P. larvae to larval fluids was studied by microarray technology. Early responses of P. larvae to larval fluids are characterized by a general down-regulation of oligopeptide and sugar transporter genes, as well as by amino acid and carbohydrate metabolic genes, among others. Late responses are dominated by general down-regulation of sporulation genes and up-regulation of phage-related genes. A theoretical mechanism of carbon catabolite repression is discussed. © 2014 De Smet et al.		amino acid, carbohydrate, oligopeptide, virulence factor, American foulbrood, article, body fluid, catabolite repression, controlled study, down regulation, gene, genetic association, genetic transcription, growth rate, honeybee, in vitro study, larva, nonhuman, nucleotide sequence, phage related gene, sporogenesis, sporulation gene, sugar transporter gene, upregulation, animal, bacterial genome, bee, body fluid, gene ontology, genetics, growth, development and aging, metabolism, microbiology, Paenibacillus, phenotype, Animals, Bees, Body Fluids, Gene Ontology, Genome, Bacterial, Larva, Paenibacillus, Phenotype, Transcription, Genetic, Virulence Factors	2014-02-20
The distribution of Aspergillus spp. opportunistic parasites in hives and their pathogenicity to honey bees	Stonebrood is a disease of honey bee larvae caused by fungi from the genus Aspergillus. As very few studies have focused on the epidemiological aspects of stonebrood and diseased brood may be rapidly discarded by worker bees, it is possible that a high number of cases go undetected. Aspergillus spp. fungi are ubiquitous and associated with disease in many insects, plants, animals and man. They are regarded as opportunistic pathogens that require immunocompromised hosts to establish infection. Microbiological studies have shown high prevalences of Aspergillus spp. in apiaries which occur saprophytically on hive substrates. However, the specific conditions required for pathogenicity to develop remain unknown. In this study, an apiary was screened to determine the prevalence and diversity of Aspergillus spp. fungi. A series of dose-response tests were then conducted using laboratory reared larvae to determine the pathogenicity and virulence of frequently occurring isolates. The susceptibility of adult worker bees to Aspergillus flavus was also tested. Three isolates (A. flavus, Aspergillus nomius and Aspergillus phoenicis) of the ten species identified were pathogenic to honey bee larvae. Moreover, adult honey bees were also confirmed to be highly susceptible to A. flavus infection when they ingested conidia. Neither of the two Aspergillus fumigatus strains used in dose-response tests induced mortality in larvae and were the least pathogenic of the isolates tested. These results confirm the ubiquity of Aspergillus spp. in the apiary environment and highlight their potential to infect both larvae and adult bees. © 2014.

Interactions between fungi and bacteria influence microbial community structure in the Megachile rotundata larval gut	Recent declines in bee populations coupled with advances in DNA-sequencing technology have sparked a renaissance in studies of bee-associated microbes. Megachile rotundata is an important field crop pollinator, but is stricken by chalkbrood, a disease caused by the fungus Ascosphaera aggregata. To test the hypothesis that some gut microbes directly or indirectly affect the growth of others, we applied four treatments to the pollen provisions of M. rotundata eggs and young larvae: antibacterials, antifungals, A. aggregata spores and a no-treatment control. We allowed the larvae to develop, and then used 454 pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR (for A. aggregata) to investigate fungal and bacterial communities in the larval gut. Antifungals lowered A. aggregata abundance but increased the diversity of surviving fungi. This suggests that A. aggregata inhibits the growth of other fungi in the gut through chemical or competitive interaction. Bacterial richness decreased under the antifungal treatment, suggesting that changes in the fungal community caused changes in the bacterial community. We found no evidence that bacteria affect fungal communities. Lactobacillus kunkeei clade bacteria were common members of the larval gut microbiota and exhibited antibiotic resistance. Further research is needed to determine the effect of gut microbes on M. rotundata health. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Pollen diet for in vitro rearing of africanized honey bee larvae, Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae)	Pollen is the major protein source for honey bees, Apis mellifera. It is essential for the adults to produce royal jelly to feed the larvae. Young larvae receive the brood food, whereas the older (over 3 days old) larvae receive pollen in addition to brood food. The nutritional value of pollen has been investigated only in adults or at the colony level. Protocols for rearing Africanized honey bee larvae in vitro using diets with mixtures of pollen had not been established. We examined different concentrations (2.5, 5 and 10%) of two mixtures of pollen in the larval diet. The effects of pollen diets on larval development were assessed. The survival and development of larvae fed with 10% pollen was impaired; this concentration should be avoided. Concentrations of 2.5 and 5% pollen did not show significant changes in survival, weight, development or the hemolymph protein profile when compared to the controls (without pollen). However, differences in larval survival were observed between the two pollen mixtures (pollen blends 1 and 2), suggesting that a diet with a superior digestibility and greater familial diversity of pollen (blend 2) is more nutritionally adequate.			2014-01-27
Four common pesticides, their mixtures and a formulation solvent in the hive environment have high oral toxicity to honey bee larvae	Recently, the widespread distribution of pesticides detected in the hive has raised serious concerns about pesticide exposure on honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) health. A larval rearing method was adapted to assess the chronic oral toxicity to honey bee larvae of the four most common pesticides detected in pollen and wax - fluvalinate, coumaphos, chlorothalonil, and chloropyrifos - tested alone and in all combinations. All pesticides at hive-residue levels triggered a significant increase in larval mortality compared to untreated larvae by over two fold, with a strong increase after 3 days of exposure. Among these four pesticides, honey bee larvae were most sensitive to chlorothalonil compared to adults. Synergistic toxicity was observed in the binary mixture of chlorothalonil with fluvalinate at the concentrations of 34 mg/L and 3 mg/L, respectively; whereas, when diluted by 10 fold, the interaction switched to antagonism. Chlorothalonil at 34 mg/L was also found to synergize the miticide coumaphos at 8 mg/L. The addition of coumaphos significantly reduced the toxicity of the fluvalinate and chlorothalonil mixture, the only significant non-additive effect in all tested ternary mixtures. We also tested the common 'inert' ingredient N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone at seven concentrations, and documented its high toxicity to larval bees. We have shown that chronic dietary exposure to a fungicide, pesticide mixtures, and a formulation solvent have the potential to impact honey bee populations, and warrants further investigation. We suggest that pesticide mixtures in pollen be evaluated by adding their toxicities together, until complete data on interactions can be accumulated. © 2014 Zhu et al.		1 methyl 2 pyrrolidinone, chlorothalonil, chlorpyrifos, coumafos, fluvalinate, adult, animal experiment, article, bioaccumulation, bioassay, chemical analysis, chemical interaction, chemical structure, concentration response, controlled study, detoxification, drug formulation, environmental exposure, honeybee, larval stage, mortality, mouth disease, nonhuman, oral toxicity, probability, rearing, sensitivity analysis, Administration, Oral, Animals, Bees, Chlorpyrifos, Coumaphos, Diet, Drug Synergism, Environment, Honey, Larva, Pesticides, Pyrrolidinones, Solvents	2014-01-08
Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus: Epidemiology, Pathogenesis and Implications for Honey Bee Health	Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) is a widespread RNA virus of honey bees that has been linked with colony losses. Here we describe the transmission, prevalence, and genetic traits of this virus, along with host transcriptional responses to infections. Further, we present RNAi-based strategies for limiting an important mechanism used by IAPV to subvert host defenses. Our study shows that IAPV is established as a persistent infection in honey bee populations, likely enabled by both horizontal and vertical transmission pathways. The phenotypic differences in pathology among different strains of IAPV found globally may be due to high levels of standing genetic variation. Microarray profiles of host responses to IAPV infection revealed that mitochondrial function is the most significantly affected biological process, suggesting that viral infection causes significant disturbance in energy-related host processes. The expression of genes involved in immune pathways in adult bees indicates that IAPV infection triggers active immune responses. The evidence that silencing an IAPV-encoded putative suppressor of RNAi reduces IAPV replication suggests a functional assignment for a particular genomic region of IAPV and closely related viruses from the Family Dicistroviridae, and indicates a novel therapeutic strategy for limiting multiple honey bee viruses simultaneously and reducing colony losses due to viral diseases. We believe that the knowledge and insights gained from this study will provide a new platform for continuing studies of the IAPV-host interactions and have positive implications for disease management that will lead to mitigation of escalating honey bee colony losses worldwide. © 2014.		biological marker, messenger RNA, small interfering RNA, virus protein, virus RNA, animal, antagonists and inhibitors, bee, colony collapse, Dicistroviridae, DNA microarray, gene expression profiling, genetics, host pathogen interaction, in situ hybridization, metabolism, pathogenicity, pathology, real time polymerase chain reaction, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, virology, Virus Diseases, virus genome, Animals, Bees, Biological Markers, Colony Collapse, Dicistroviridae, Gene Expression Profiling, Genome, Viral, Host-Pathogen Interactions, In Situ Hybridization, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, RNA, Messenger, RNA, Small Interfering, RNA, Viral, Viral Proteins, Virus Diseases	2014-01-01
Honey bee health in apiaries in the Vale do Paraíba, São Paulo state, Southeastern Brazil	Bee health is a growing global concern due to phenomena with as yet undefined causes, such as the sudden population decline of colonies that has been observed in apiaries in many countries, recently including Brazil. The main objective of this study was to assess the presence and/or prevalence of pathogens that afflict Africanized Apis mellifera bees in the Vale do Paraíba region of São Paulo state, Brazil. Three sampling periods were established: period 1 - August and September 2009 (winter/early spring); period 2 - December 2009 and January 2010 (summer); and period 3 - April and May 2010 (autumn). Samples were collected of honeycomb from the brood area, combs containing capped brood, adult bees that cover the brood and foraging bees, to evaluate the presence and prevalence of Paenibacillus larvae, Varroa destructor and Nosema sp. The results indicated that the intensity of infection by Nosema ceranae and infestation rates of V. destructor in the hives were low (mean 637×103 spores of Nosema ceranae, 5.41% infestation of Varroa in adult bees and 4.17% infestation of Varroa in brood), with no detection of P. larvae spores in the samples. The prevalence of N. ceranae and V. destructor was high, at respective values of 85.2 and 95.7%. All told, 1,668 samples were collected from 438 hives, in 59 apiaries. These results demonstrate that although mites and microsporidia are widespread in the region's colonies, the Africanized bees are apparently tolerant to pathogens and parasites. However, the mechanisms related to defense against pathogens are not completely clear, and monitoring and prophylactic measures are essential to maintain the health of bee colonies.

Immunogene and viral transcript dynamics during parasitic Varroa destructor mite infection of developing honey bee (Apis mellifera) pupae	The ectoparasitic Varroa destructor mite is a major contributor to the ongoing honey bee health crisis. Varroa interacts with honey bee viruses, exacerbating their pathogenicity. In addition to vectoring viruses, immunosuppression of the developing honey bee hosts by Varroa has been proposed to explain the synergy between viruses and mites. However, the evidence for honey bee immune suppression by V. destructor is contentious. We systematically studied the quantitative effects of experimentally introduced V. destructor mites on immune gene expression at five specific time points during the development of the honey bee hosts. Mites reproduced normally and were associated with increased titers of deformed wing virus in the developing bees. Our data on different immune genes show little evidence for immunosuppression of honey bees by V. destructor. Experimental wounding of developing bees increases relative immune gene expression and deformed wing virus titers. Combined, these results suggest that mite feeding activity itself and not immunosuppression may contribute to the synergy between viruses and mites. However, our results also suggest that increased expression of honey bee immune genes decreases mite reproductive success, which may be explored to enhance mite control strategies. Finally, our expression data for multiple immune genes across developmental time and different experimental treatments indicates co-regulation of several of these genes and thus improves our understanding of the understudied honey bee immune system. © 2014.

The architecture of the pollen hoarding syndrome in honey bees: Implications for understanding social evolution, behavioral syndromes, and selective breeding	Social evolution has influenced every aspect of contemporary honey bee biology, but the details are difficult to reconstruct. The reproductive ground plan hypothesis of social evolution proposes that central regulators of the gonotropic cycle of solitary insects have been co-opted to coordinate social complexity in honey bees, such as the division of labor among workers. The predicted trait associations between reproductive physiology and social behavior have been identified in the context of the pollen hoarding syndrome, a larger suite of interrelated traits. The genetic architecture of this syndrome is characterized by a partially overlapping genetic architecture with several consistent, pleiotropic quantitative trait loci (QTL). Despite these central QTL and an integrated hormonal regulation, separate aspects of the pollen hoarding syndrome may evolve independently due to peripheral QTL and additionally segregating genetic variance. The characterization of the pollen hoarding syndrome has also demonstrated that this syndrome involves many non-behavioral traits, which may be the case for numerous "behavioral" syndromes. Furthermore, the genetic architecture of the pollen hoarding syndrome has implications for breeding programs for improving honey health and other desirable traits: if these traits are comparable to the pollen hoarding syndrome, consistent pleiotropic QTL will enable marker-assisted selection, while sufficient additional genetic variation may permit the dissociation of trade-offs for efficient multiple trait selection. © 2013 INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		caching, evolutionary biology, genetic marker, genetic variation, honeybee, labor division, life history trait, pleiotropy, pollen, selective breeding, social behavior	2014-01-01
Thiacloprid-Nosema ceranae interactions in honey bees: Host survivorship but not parasite reproduction is dependent on pesticide dose	Interactions between stressors contribute to the recently reported increase in losses of honey bee colonies. Here we demonstrated that a synergistic effect on mortality by the low toxic, commonly used neonicotinoid thiacloprid and the nearly ubiquitous gut parasite Nosemaceranae is dependent on the pesticide dose. Furthermore, thiacloprid had a negative influence on N.ceranae reproduction. Our results highlight that interactions among honey bee health stressors can be dynamic and should be studied across a broader range of combinations. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.		insecticide, pyridine derivative, thiacloprid, thiazine derivative, animal, bee, drug effects, host parasite interaction, Nosema, parasitology, physiology, reproduction, Animals, Bees, Host-Parasite Interactions, Insecticides, Nosema, Pyridines, Reproduction, Thiazines	2014-01-01
Detection of spiroplasma melliferum in honey bee colonies in the US	Spiroplasma infections in honey bees have been reported in Europe and Asia quite recently, due to intensive studies on the epidemiology of honey bee diseases. The situation in the US is less well analyzed. Here, we examined the honey bee colonies in Beltsville, MD, where Spiroplasma melliferum was originally reported and found S. melliferum infection in honey bees. Our data showed high variation of S. melliferum infection in honey bees with a peak prevalence in May during the course of one-year study period. The colony prevalence increased from 5% in February to 68% in May and then decreased to 25% in June and 22% in July. Despite that pathogenicity of spiroplasmas in honey bee colonies remains to be determined, our results indicated that spiroplasma infections need to be included for the consideration of the impacts on honey bee health. © 2014 .		animal, bee, Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections, microbiology, prevalence, season, Spiroplasma, United States, veterinary, Animals, Bees, Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections, Prevalence, Seasons, Spiroplasma, United States	2014-01-01
Honey bee sociogenomics: A genome-scale perspective on bee social behavior and health	The biology of honey bees involves a host of developmental, behavioral, and physiological components that allow thousands of individual bees to form complex social units. Fueled by a wealth of information from new genomic technologies, a new approach, sociogenomics, uses a focus on the genome to integrate the molecular underpinnings and ultimate explanations of social life. This approach has resulted in a massive influx of data from the honey bee genome and transcriptome, a flurry of research activity, and new insights into honey bee biology. Here, we provide an up-to-date review describing how the honey bee has been successfully studied using this approach, highlighting how the integration of genomic information into honey bee research has provided insights into worker division of labor, communication, caste differences and development, evolution, and honey bee health. We also highlight how genomic studies in other eusocial insect species have provided insights into social evolution via comparative analyses. These data have led to several important new insights about how social behavior is organized on a genomic level, including (1) the fact that gene expression is highly dynamic and responsive to the social environment, (2) that large-scale changes in gene expression can contribute to caste and behavioral differences, (3) that transcriptional networks regulating these behaviors can be related to previously established hormonal mechanisms, and (4) that some genes and pathways retain conserved roles in behavior across contexts and social insect taxa. © 2013 INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		caste, comparative study, genome, genomics, honeybee, labor division, maturation, physiological response, social behavior	2014-01-01
Correlating the pollens gathered by APIS Mellifera with the landscape features in Western France	Honey bee health depends on various factors, including the availability of food resources and chronic exposure to toxins in the foraging area. These parameters can be evaluated using indicators based on either pollen gathered to the hive or landscape features of the foraging area, including the structure, land use, or density of such specific landscape elements as hedgerows.This study examines the correlation between the diversity of pollens gathered and the landscape features in a 3-km radius using Geographic Information System technology. Palynological analyses were performed on pollen pellets collected from sixteen apiaries in western France during one year. Richness, diversity and similarity indices were calculated for land-cover features and palynological data and then compared. The land-cover analyses permitted the identification of three different landscape contexts (hedgerow, cultivated, and urban landscapes). Although the palynological profiles were highly diverse, some taxa were conserved between hives. The flower richness was greater in the apiaries from urban landscapes than in apiaries from rural landscapes, regardless of the dominant land-cover. The statistical analysis did not associate a specific flora with a specific landscape. However, it was possible to distinguish the pollen gathered by bees in urban landscapes and from pollen collected in rural areas. © 2014, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

A comparison of the activities of Greek and Turkish propolis against Paenibacillus larvae	Propolis has a long history of use in traditional medicine dating back to at least 300 BC, and has been reported to have a broad spectrum of biological activities. Since most studies have to date focused on medical uses of propolis, its antimicrobial activity against honey bee diseases has been little studied. One of the aims of this study was therefore to investigate the potential use of propolis in honey bee health, especially against American foulbrood, which causes much damage in the beekeeping industry. The second aim was to reveal the different antimicrobial activities of propolis collected from different geographical areas from the neighbouring countries of Greece and Turkey. Propolis samples collected from several regions of Greece and Turkey were investigated for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against Paenibacillus larvae. Eighteen ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP), (nine from Greece and nine from Turkey) were tested for antimicrobial activities against ten P. larvae isolates. The results showed that all P. larvae strains were susceptible to propolis extracts from both Greece and Turkey Furthermore 50% concentrations of EEP caused significantly wider inhibition zones (P=0.05) around the discs. Comparisons of the content, and locations and botanical origins of EEPs from Greece and Turkey showed that the kind of vegetation is more important factor than geographic location for their antimicrobial activity. This is the first comprehensive study concerning the antimicrobial activity of propolis samples collected from a wide area around the Aegean Sea. © IBRA 2014			2014-01-01
Insulin-like peptide response to nutritional input in honey bee workers	The rise in metabolic disorders in the past decades has heightened focus on achieving a healthy dietary balance in humans. This is also an increasingly important issue in the management of honey bees (Apis mellifera) where poor nutrition has negative effects on health and productivity in agriculture, and nutrition is suggested as a contributing factor in the recent global declines in honey bee populations. As in other organisms, the insulin/insulin-like signaling (IIS) pathway is likely involved in maintaining nutrient homeostasis in honey bees. Honey bees have two insulin-like peptides (Ilps) with differing spatial expression patterns in the fat body suggesting that AmIlp1 potentially functions in lipid metabolism while AmIlp2 is a more general indicator of nutritional status. We fed caged worker bees artificial diets high in carbohydrates, proteins or lipids and measured expression of AmIlp1, AmIlp2, and the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) to test their responses to dietary macronutrients. We also measured lifespan, worker weight and gustatory sensitivity to sugar as measures of individual physical condition. We found that expression of AmIlp1 was affected by diet composition and was highest on a diet high in protein. Expression of AmIlp2 and AmIRS were not affected by diet. Workers lived longest on a diet high in carbohydrates and low in protein and lipids. However, bees fed this diet weighed less than those that received a diet high in protein and low in carbohydrates and lipids. Bees fed the high carbohydrates diet were also more responsive to sugar, potentially indicating greater levels of hunger. These results support a role for AmIlp1 in nutritional homeostasis and provide new insight into how unbalanced diets impact individual honey bee health. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.		somatomedin, sucrose, animal, bee, body weight, fat body, longevity, metabolism, nutrition, Animals, Bees, Body Weight, Fat Body, Longevity, Nutrition Processes, Somatomedins, Sucrose	2014-01-01
Honey production of honey bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) colonies with high and low Varroa destructor (Acari: Varroidae) infestation rates in eastern Canada	The objective of this study was to compare the honey yields of groups of honey bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) colonies with high and low infestation rates of the mite Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman (Acari: Varroidae). More than 150 colonies were screened for mite fall in early spring and again 16 weeks later. The 10 colonies with the lowest rates (L) and the 10 colonies with the highest rates (H) of mite population growth were selected. These 20 colonies were evaluated for mite infestation in adult bees and honey production. Adult bee infestation in the colonies of the H group was significantly higher than in the colonies of the L group. Additionally, H and L colonies differed significantly for honey production. L colonies produced 28.91 ± 2.34 kg of honey per hive versus 18.49 ± 0.77 kg for the group of H colonies. Furthermore, the mite infestation level of colonies measured as mite fall or as number of mites per 100 bees, was significantly correlated with honey production (r = -0.62, P < 0.05 and r = -0.76, P < 0.01, respectively). These results indicate that varroa mite populations significantly reduce honey yields in honey bee colonies in eastern Canada. © Entomological Society of Canada 2013.		adult, colony, honey, honeybee, host-parasite interaction, mite, population growth, colony structure, parasitic disease, pest species, Canada, Acari, Apidae, Apis mellifera, Hymenoptera, Varroa destructor, Varroidae	2014-01-01
High Varroa mite abundance influences chemical profiles of worker bees and mite-host preferences	Honeybee disappearance is one of the major environmental and economic challenges this century has to face. The ecto-parasitic mite Varroa destructor represents one of the main causes of the worldwide beehive losses. Although halting mite transmission among beehives is of primary importance to save honeybee colonies from further decline, the natural route used by mites to abandon a collapsing colony has not been extensively investigated so far. Here, we explored whether, with increasing mite abundance within the colony, mites change their behaviour to maximize the chances of leaving a highly infested colony. We show that, at low mite abundance, mites remain within the colony and promote their reproduction by riding nurses that they distinguish from foragers by different chemical cuticular signatures. When mite abundance increases, the chemical profile of nurses and foragers tends to overlap, promoting mite departure from exploited colonies by riding pollen foragers. © 2014.

Prevention of honeybee diseases	Bee diseases, pests, and recently the collapse of colonies have become amongst the beekeeper’s biggest problems. Much can be done however to reduce the impact of pests and diseases and to prevent them from occurring in the apiary. In this chapter several management techniques are described that will help to prevent the hives from becoming infested with diseases or reduce their impact. Especially in humid areas it is important to keep hives in well-ventilated areas, away from stagnant water. It is equally important to avoid excessive sunshine on the hives, by providing shade at the hottest moments of the day, especially in the tropics. The importance of being a hygienic beekeeper, through changing combs in the brood chamber at least every 2 years and by cleaning the bottom board regularly, is stressed, as well as the importance of using the adequate cell width according to the race of bees you have, as a method of helping your bees to resist infestation by Varroa destructor © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.			2014-01-01
Bee bread increases honeybee haemolymph protein and promote better survival despite of causing higher Nosema ceranae abundance in honeybees	Adequate protein nutrition supports healthy honeybees and reduces the susceptibility to disease. However little is known concerning the effect of the diet on Nosema ceranae development, an obligate intracellular parasite that disturbs the protein metabolism of honeybees (Apis mellifera). Here we tested the effect of natural (bee bread) and non-natural protein diets (substitute) on haemolymph proteins titers of honeybee and N.ceranae spore production. The natural diet induced higher levels of protein and parasite development, but the survival of bees was also higher than with non-natural diets. The data showed that the administration of an artificially high nutritious diet in terms of crude protein content is not sufficient to promote healthy bees; rather the protein ingested should be efficiently assimilated. The overall results support the idea that the physiological condition of the bees is linked to protein levels in the haemolymph, which affects the tolerance to parasite; consequently the negative impact of the parasite on host fitness is not associated only with the level of infection. © 2014 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.		propolis, protein, animal, bee, chemistry, fungus spore, growth, development and aging, hemolymph, immunology, metabolism, microbiology, Nosema, Animals, Bees, Hemolymph, Nosema, Propolis, Proteins, Spores, Fungal	2014-01-01
Remote beehive monitoring using acoustic signals	Recent developments in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have led to their use in remote data acquisition and automatic data analysis applications, which have proven to be an invaluable tool in a diverse range of fields including biosecurity. Further indications have been found that honeybee health can be monitored and determined through the use of acoustic analysis. In this paper, we present a system that has the ability to remotely detect the presence of pest infestation on a colony of honeybees by comparing the acoustic fingerprint of a hive to a fingerprint of known status. This will aid the goals of increasing surveillance programs by reducing the labour time and costs that are associated with managing and maintaining monitoring programs. Other benefits of the system proposed in this article include the ability to make available a collection of deterministic, standardised and nondiscriminatory statistical data for the purpose of research into determining the causes of colony collapse disorder.

Evaluating exposure and potential effects on honeybee brood (Apis mellifera) development using glyphosate as an example	This study aimed to develop an approach to evaluate potential effects of plant protection products on honeybee brood with colonies at realistic worst-case exposure rates. The approach comprised 2 stages. In the first stage, honeybee colonies were exposed to a commercial formulation of glyphosate applied to flowering Phacelia tanacetifolia with glyphosate residues quantified in relevant matrices (pollen and nectar) collected by foraging bees on days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 postapplication and glyphosate levels in larvae were measured on days 4 and 7. Glyphosate levels in pollen were approximately 10 times higher than in nectar and glyphosate demonstrated rapid decline in both matrices. Residue data along with foraging rates and food requirements of the colony were then used to set dose rates in the effects study. In the second stage, the toxicity of technical glyphosate to developing honeybee larvae and pupae, and residues in larvae, were then determined by feeding treated sucrose directly to honeybee colonies at dose rates that reflect worst-case exposure scenarios. There were no significant effects from glyphosate observed in brood survival, development, and mean pupal weight. Additionally, there were no biologically significant levels of adult mortality observed in any glyphosate treatment group. Significant effects were observed only in the fenoxycarb toxic reference group and included increased brood mortality and a decline in the numbers of bees and brood. Mean glyphosate residues in larvae were comparable at 4 days after spray application in the exposure study and also following dosing at a level calculated from the mean measured levels in pollen and nectar, showing the applicability and robustness of the approach for dose setting with honeybee brood studies. This study has developed a versatile and predictive approach for use in higher tier honeybee toxicity studies. It can be used to realistically quantify exposure of colonies to pesticides to allow the appropriate dose rates to be determined, based on realistic worst-case residues in pollen and nectar and estimated intake by the colony, as shown by the residue analysis. Previous studies have used the standard methodology developed primarily to identify pesticides with insect-growth disrupting properties of pesticide formulations, which are less reliant on identifying realistic exposure scenarios. However, this adaptation of the method can be used to determine dose-response effects of colony level exposure to pesticides with a wide range of properties. This approach would limit the number of replicated tunnel or field-scale studies that need to be undertaken to assess effects on honeybee brood and may be of particular benefit where residues in pollen and nectar are crop- and/or formulation-specific, such as systemic seed treatments and granular applications. © 2014 The Authors.		glycine, glyphosate, herbicide, nectar, analogs and derivatives, animal, bee, chemistry, drug effects, growth, development and aging, Hydrophyllaceae, larva, metabolism, nectar, pollen, procedures, risk assessment, toxicity testing, Animals, Bees, Glycine, Herbicides, Hydrophyllaceae, Larva, Plant Nectar, Pollen, Risk Assessment, Toxicity Tests	2014-01-01
Biodegradation of imidacloprid in an open compost pile	The aim of the study was to determine in which way and at what speed a composting process affects the degradation of imidacloprid N-{1-[(6-chloro- 3-pyridyl)methyl]-4,5-dihydroimidazol-2-yl} nitramide, one of the most effective and most widely used insecticide in the world, but also at the same time one of the most accused insecticide for bee colony collapse disorder. The process of imidacloprid degradation through composting was monitored at four experimental open piles, with an additional fifth pile composed of random green parts of plants and soil and used as a simulation of natural and spontaneous degradation of organic matter in a field. Two of the compost piles were kept under aerobic conditions and forced aerated through perforated pipes with a ventilator, while two were kept under anoxic conditions (the compost was wrapped in impermeable foil). Pseudomonas aeruginosa FN culture was added in two composting piles, one under aerobic conditions and one under anoxic conditions. It has been established that the half-life of imidacloprid occurred after 29 days in the pile inoculated with bacterial cells P. aeruginosa FN under anoxic condition, which is considerably faster than in spontaneous degradation in the soil, which was simulated in the fifth pile (60 days). The physical and chemical properties of compost piles did not significantly affect the dynamics of degradation rate, which was faster in the mesophilic and thermophilic phase and slower in the maturation phase. The half-life of imidacloprid was shorter in piles with anoxic condition. The added culture, P. aeruginosa FN, has accelerated the imidacloprid degradation rate in both piles with anoxic and aerobic conditions, faster than in the piles without the P. aeruginosa FN culture. That is lesser influence than was expected, probably because of the abundance of microorganisms from animal manure, which created the competitive relations with P. aeruginosa FN cultures. © 2014, World Food Ltd. and WFL Publishers.

Paratransgenesis feasibility in the honeybee (Apis mellifera) using Fructobacillus fructosus commensal	Aims: To establish the molecular tools for honeybee paratransgenesis. Methods and Results: Commensal bacteria were isolated from two honeybees. Based on 16S ribosomal RNA sequence analysis, some isolates were identified as Fructobacillus fructosus, Lactobacillus kunkeei, Gilliamella apicola, Acinetobacter spp, Arthrobacter spp and Pseudomonas spp. Rolling circle and theta replicons were successfully introduced into F. fructosus and Lact. kunkeei. Green fluorescent protein was expressed into both species. The 7·3 Kb Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 operon encoding a cluster of five genes involved in the metabolism of galactose via the Leloir pathway was functionally expressed into a non-galactose-fermenting strain of F. fructosus enabling it to grow on galactose as a sole carbon source. Conclusions: Fructophilic lactic acid bacteria, F. fructosus and Lact. kunkeei, are amenable to extensive genetic manipulations.

A survey of imidacloprid levels in water sources potentially frequented by honeybees (Apis mellifera) in the eastern USA	Imidacloprid, a water-soluble neonicotinoid pesticide used globally in many applications, has been the subject of numerous studies (1) to determine its sublethal effects (5-100 ppb, LD50 ∼200 ppb) on honeybees. This study was undertaken to determine, by ELISA assay, the presence of imidacloprid in water sources potentially frequented by honeybees in urban, suburban, and rural environments across the state of Maryland. Eighteen sites (six samples/site) were chosen which spanned diverse habitats including golf courses, nursery, livestock and crop farms, residential neighborhoods, and cityscapes. Hives were present either at or within 0.5 miles of each site. Imidacloprid was quantifiable in 8 % of the samples at sublethal levels (7-131 ppb). They were not clustered at any one type of site. Results for 13 % of the samples were at the threshold of detection; all others were below the detection limit of the assay (<0.2 ppb). © 2014 The Author(s).

Mating disruption of the honeybee mite Varroa destructor under laboratory and field conditions	Mating in the mite Varroa destructor, an ectoparasite of the honeybee, takes place within the sealed brood cell of its host and is triggered by a female sex pheromone consisting of three fatty acids and their respective ethyl esters. In a laboratory bioassay, we observed interactions among offspring of a Varroa female at 11 days after host cell capping in the absence and in the presence of the sex pheromone and clearly demonstrated that male mites were not able to distinguish between receptive daughters and either older or immature and unreceptive females when exposed to the pheromone. In addition, mating attempts in the presence of the pheromone with otherwise receptive females were clearly of shorter duration and males often failed to select a receptive female. In order to evaluate the effect of pheromone exposure on successful copulations and the number of spermatozoa transferred under field conditions, we sprayed one of the pheromone components, oleic acid, on an empty brood comb before host egg-laying and Varroa infestation and counted the spermatozoa of daughter mites taken from this comb. We could show that the number of spermatozoa was indeed reduced, and 20 % of females lacked spermatozoa. Our results open up new possibilities and represent a promising step toward biological control of Varroa mites in beehives. © 2014 Springer Basel.

Nutrition affects longevity and gene expression in honey bee (Apis mellifera) workers	Nutrition is a major factor affecting animal health, resistance to disease, and survival. In honey bees (Apis mellifera), nectar or honey (carbohydrates) is the energy source, while pollen, which is the sole dietary source of protein, is essential for both larval and adult development. Royal jelly (RJ), a secretion from workers with high protein content, plays a critical role in which queens are fed throughout their lives, is responsible for switching the worker phenotype into the queen one. The role of RJ in extending the lifespan of caged workers is not clear. In this study, we determined longevity of caged workers fed with different diets (carbohydrate only, pollen, and pollen+ RJ) and also expression of six genes in these bees. We found that workers fed with pollen and royal jelly together (P+ RJ+) showed the best survival, followed by workers fed with pollen only (P + RJ-), and workers fed with neither pollen nor RJ (P- RJ-) had the shortest life. Pollen only (P + RJ-) and royal jelly together (P+ RJ+) significantly affected four of the six genes studied. While pollen and royal jelly together (P+ RJ+) only affected the vitellogenin gene compared to pollen only (P+ RJ-). These results demonstrate that pollen and RJ extended worker longevity, suggesting that they may improve the nutritional conditions of bees or contain health and longevity-promoting factors. Further analysis of the lifespan-extending genes may broaden our understanding of gene network involved in the regulation of longevity. © 2014 INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		animal, disease, gene expression, honey, longevity, nectar, nutrition, phenotype, protein, survival	2014-01-01
Sub-lethal exposure to neonicotinoids impaired honey bees winterization before proceeding to colony collapse disorder	Honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colony collapse disorder (CCD) that appeared in 2005/2006 still lingers in many parts of the world. Here we show that sub-lethal exposure of neonicotinoids, imidacloprid or clothianidin, affected the winterization of healthy colonies that subsequently leads to CCD. We found honey bees in both control and neonicotinoid-treated groups progressed almost identically through the summer and fall seasons and observed no acute morbidity or mortality in either group until the end of winter. Bees from six of the twelve neonicotinoid-treated colonies had abandoned their hives, and were eventually dead with symptoms resembling CCD. However, we observed a complete opposite phenomenon in the control colonies in which instead of abandonment, they were re-populated quickly with new emerging bees. Only one of the six control colonies was lost due to Nosema-like infection. The observations from this study may help to elucidate the mechanisms by which sub-lethal neonicotinoids exposure caused honey bees to vanish from their hives.			2014-01-01
Detection of Aethina tumida Murray (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae.) in Italy: Outbreaks and early reaction measures	The first detection of Aethina tumida Murray (the small hive beetle) in Italy occurred on 5 September 2014. Three nuclei containing honey bees (Apis mellifera) and located in a clementine (citrus) orchard near an important international harbour in the Calabria region (southern Italy) were heavily infested with adult and larval A. tumida. A. tumida infestation is a notifiable disease of honey bees in the European Union as well as an OIE listed disease. To prevent any A. tumida introduction, the importation of honey bees is regulated strictly in the European Union (Commission Regulation (EU) No. 206/2010). Early reaction measures adopted in Italy require that beekeepers must notify A. tumida discovery to the local veterinary services and cannot move their colonies. Furthermore, a protection area (20 km radius) and surveillance (100 km radius) zone should be established. The surveillance zone now includes the entire territory of Calabria region. Compulsory visits to all apiaries in the protection zone with the collection of the spatial information by means of a georeferentiation process (georeferentiation can be defined as the process to describe a location relative to the earth, in this context the process consists on the collection of the spatial coordinate of a point that represents the spatial location of the apiaries by means of a GPS device) and colony inspection according to 5% expected prevalence (95% CI) are applied. Destruction of infested apiaries is compulsory and the soil under the infested colonies must be ploughed and treated with pyrethroids. If apiaries in the protection zone are found to be negative, traps are placed. In the surveillance zone, veterinarians visit apiaries that are selected according to a risk analysis (migration in infested areas, honey bee or materials exchange) or randomly and colonies are inspected according to 2% expected prevalence (95% CI). Furthermore, in Italy as well in the rest of Europe, investigations are in progress by competent authorities to make an inventory of all bees and colonies moved from Calabria during 2014. Subsequent controls on colonies should be implemented. People from the honey bee network (beekeepers, veterinarians, beekeeping material producers and distributors) should be aware and informed of the hazard posed by A. tumida to honey bees. © IBRA 2014			2014-01-01
A national survey of managed honey bee 2012-2013 annual colony losses in the USA: Results from the Bee Informed Partnership	For the past six years in which overwintering mortality of honey bee colonies has been surveyed in the USA, estimates of colony loss have fluctuated around one-third of the national population. Here we report on the losses for the 2012-2013 seasons. We collected data from 6,482 US beekeepers (6,114 backyard, 233 sideline, and 135 commercial beekeepers) to document overwintering mortality rates of honey bee colonies for the USA. Responding beekeepers reported a total 30.6% (95% CI: 30.16-31.13%) loss of US colonies over the winter, with each beekeeper losing on average 44.8% (95% CI: 43.88-45.66%) of their colonies. Total winter losses varied across states (range: 11.0% to 54.7%). The self-reported level of acceptable winter loss was 14.6%, and 73.2% of the respondents had mortality rates greater than this level. The leading self-identified causes of overwintering mortality were different according to the operation type; backyard beekeepers generally self-identified "manageable" factors (e.g., starvation, weak colony in the fall), while commercial beekeepers generally identified non-manageable factors (e.g., queen failure, pesticides) as the main cause of losses. For the first time in this series of surveys, we estimated mortality during the summer (total loss = 25.3% (95% CI: 24.80-25.74%), average loss = 12.5% (95% CI: 11.92-13.06%)). The entire 12-months period between April 2012 and April 2013 yielded a total loss of 45.2% (95% CI: 44.58-45.75%), and an average loss of 49.4% (95% CI: 48.46-50.43%). While we found that commercial beekeepers lost fewer colonies than backyard beekeepers in the winter (30.2% (95% CI: 26.54-33.93% vs 45.4% (44.46-46.32%) respectively), the situation was reversed in the summer where commercial beekeepers reported higher average losses than backyard beekeepers (21.6% (95% CI: 18.4-24.79%) vs 12.1% (11.46-12.65%)). These findings demonstrate the ongoing difficulties of US beekeepers in maintaining overall colony heath and survival. © IBRA 2014.			2014-01-01
Identification of developmentally-specific kinotypes and mechanisms of Varroa mite resistance through whole-organism, kinome analysis of honeybee	Recent investigations associate Varroa destructor (Mesostigmata: Varroidae) parasitism and its associated pathogens and agricultural pesticides with negative effects on colony health, resulting in sporadic global declines in domestic honeybee (Apis mellifera) populations. These events have motivated efforts to develop research tools that can offer insight into the causes of declining bee health as well as identify biomarkers to guide breeding programs. Here we report the development of a bee-specific peptide array for characterizing global cellular kinase activity in whole bee extracts. The arrays reveal distinct, developmentally-specific signaling profiles between bees with differential susceptibility to infestation by Varroa mites. Gene ontology analysis of the differentially phosphorylated peptides indicates that the differential susceptibility to Varroa mite infestation does not reflect compromised immunity; rather, there is evidence for mite-mediated immune suppression within the susceptible phenotype that may reduce the ability of these bees to counter secondary viral infections. This hypothesis is supported by the demonstration of more diverse viral infections in mite-infested, susceptible adult bees. The bee-specific peptide arrays are an effective tool for understanding the molecular basis of this complex phenotype as well as for the discovery and utilization of phosphorylation biomarkers for breeding programs. © 2014 Robertson, Trost, Scruten, Robertson, Mostajeran, Connor, Kusalik, Griebel and Napper.		proteome, article, gene ontology, honeybee, immunosuppressive treatment, mite infestation, nonhuman, peptide synthesis, phenotype, polymerase chain reaction, protein analysis, protein microarray, pupa (life cycle stage), RNA extraction, Varroa, Varroa destructor, virus detection, virus infection	2014-01-01
Comparsion of two multiresidue methods for pesticide determination in pollen	A comparative study between the conventional and the modified QuEChERS method was performed in order to select the methodology that works better for the determination of pesticide residues in pollen. For this study, 58 pesticides were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Comparison was made using different validation parameters for each method as recovery, precision (as repeatability), limits of detection, which were estimate using different approaches. In addition, a factorial design was used to evaluate the efficiency of both methods in different types of pollen. The results showed that the modified method is appropriate for the analysis of pesticide residues in pollen. It was also found that this method has better detection limits, better accuracy and better selectivity than the conventional QuEChERS method for pesticide analysis in bee pollen.

Trace Analysis of Seven Neonicotinoid Insecticides in Bee Pollen by Solid-Liquid Extraction and Liquid Chromatography Coupled to Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry	A new, fast, simple, and efficient sample treatment to extract seven neonicotinoid insecticides (acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) in corbicular bee pollen has been developed. This procedure consisted of a solid-liquid extraction of the neonicotinoids from pollen with dichloromethane, followed by evaporation and reconstitution. Once the neonicotinoids were extracted, they were determined using a liquid chromatography coupled to an electrospray ionization mass spectrometry method. The method was validated in terms of selectivity, linearity, precision and recovery. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.4-2.8 μg/kg and 1.2-9.1 μg/kg, respectively, and the extraction recoveries were between 86 and 106 % in all cases. Finally, the proposed method was applied to analyze bee pollen samples collected from apiaries located close to fruit orchards in two Spanish regions, and traces of acetamiprid and imidacloprid were found in two samples. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

A large-scale field study examining effects of exposure to clothianidin seed-treated canola on honey bee colony health development, and overwintering success	In summer 2012, we initiated a large-scale field experiment in southern Ontario, Canada, to determine whether exposure to clothianidin seed-treated canola (oil seed rape) has any adverse impacts on honey bees. Colonies were placed in clothianidin seed-treated or control canola fields during bloom, and thereafter were moved to an apiary with no surrounding crops grown from seeds treated with neonicotinoids. Colony weight gain, honey production, pest incidence, bee mortality, number of adults, and amount of sealed brood were assessed in each colony throughout summer and autumn. Samples of honey, beeswax, pollen, and nectar were regularly collected, and samples were analyzed for clothianidin residues. Several of these endpoints were also measured in spring 2013. Overall, colonies were vigorous during and after the exposure period, and we found no effects of exposure to clothianidin seed-treated canola on any endpoint measures. Bees foraged heavily on the test fields during peak bloom and residue analysis indicated that honey bees were exposed to low levels (0.5-2 ppb) of clothianidin in pollen. Low levels of clothianidin were detected in a few pollen samples collected toward the end of the bloom from control hives, illustrating the difficulty of conducting a perfectly controlled field study with freeranging honey bees in agricultural landscapes. Overwintering success did not differ significantly between treatment and control hives, and was similar to overwintering colony loss rates reported for the winter of 2012-2013 for beekeepers in Ontario and Canada. Our results suggest that exposure to canola grown from seed treated with clothianidin poses low risk to honey bees. © 2014 Cutler et al.		clothianidin, pesticide residue, propolis, adult, arthropod community, Article, controlled study, environmental exposure, field study, honey, honeybee, image analysis, insect development, mite, mortality, nectar, nonhuman, organism colony, overwintering, pollen, rapeseed, seed treatment, Apis mellifera, Brassica napus var. napus	2014-01-01
High levels of genetic diversity in Nosema ceranae within Apis mellifera colonies	Nosema ceranae is a widespread honeybee parasite, considered to be one of the pathogens involved in the colony losses phenomenon. To date, little is known about its intraspecific genetic variability. The few studies on N. ceranae variation have focused on the subunits of ribosomal DNA, which are not ideal for this purpose and have limited resolution. Here we characterized three single copy loci (Actin, Hsp70 and RPB1) in three N. ceranae isolates from Hungary and Hawaii. Our results provide evidence of unexpectedly high levels of intraspecific polymorphism, the coexistence of a wide variety of haplotypes within each bee colony, and the occurrence of genetic recombination in RPB1. Most haplotypes are not shared across isolates and derive from a few frequent haplotypes by a reduced number of singletons (mutations that appear usually just once in the sample), which suggest that they have a fairly recent origin. Overall, our data indicate that this pathogen has experienced a recent population expansion. The presence of multiple haplotypes within individual isolates could be explained by the existence of different strains of N. ceranae infecting honeybee colonies in the field which complicates, and must not be overlooked, further analysis of host-parasite interactions. © Cambridge University Press 2013.		actin, heat shock protein 70, RNA polymerase II, actin, fungal protein, heat shock protein 70, RNA polymerase II, allele, Apis mellifera, Article, DNA polymorphism, gene linkage disequilibrium, gene locus, genetic marker, genetic recombination, genetic variability, haplotype, host parasite interaction, Hungary, mutation rate, nonhuman, Nosema ceranae, nucleotide sequence, priority journal, United States, animal, bee, DNA sequence, genetics, host pathogen interaction, microbiology, molecular genetics, mutation, Nosema, physiology, species difference, veterinary, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Nosema ceranae, Actins, Animals, Base Sequence, Bees, Fungal Proteins, Genetic Variation, Haplotypes, Host-Pathogen Interactions, HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins, Molecular Sequence Data, Mutation, Nosema, RNA Polymerase II, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Species Specificity	2014-01-01
Following beekeeping: More-than-human practice in agrifood	Ongoing losses of pollinators challenge agrifood futures and highlight the need to examine beekeeping practices, and yet social sciences have little to say on the subject. This paper takes beekeeping, a fundamental if often overlooked aspect of contemporary agrifood production, as its subject. Beekeeping is examined through a combination of more-than-human studies and social practice theory, literatures with which agrifood scholars have yet to widely engage. The paper outlines connections and tensions between these fields, to develop a vital approach to more-than-human practice. The potential of such an approach is illustrated through ethnographic investigation of commercial beekeeping in Australia. Beekeeping is followed through three constituent activities: setting fruit; shifting hives; and, chasing honey. This exploration reveals shifting agency among practitioners, frictions among considerations of the practice and its practitioners, and new dis/connections among commodities, agendas, and places. This approach to contemporary beekeeping indicates other possible points of intervention important to future practice, with wider implications for agrifood production and research. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.		apiculture, commodity market, food production, honeybee, pollination, commodity, Australia, Apis mellifera	2014-01-01
Risks of neonicotinoid insecticides to honeybees	The European honeybee, Apis mellifera, is an important pollinator of agricultural crops. Since 2006, when unexpectedly high colony losses were first reported, articles have proliferated in the popular press suggesting a range of possible causes and raising alarm over the general decline of bees. Suggested causes include pesticides, genetically modified crops, habitat fragmentation, and introduced diseases and parasites. Scientists have concluded that multiple factors in various combinations-including mites, fungi, viruses, and pesticides, as well as other factors such as reduction in forage, poor nutrition, and queen failure-are the most probable cause of elevated colony loss rates. Investigators and regulators continue to focus on the possible role that insecticides, particularly the neonicotinoids, may play in honeybee health. Neonicotinoid insecticides are insect neurotoxicants with desirable features such as broad-spectrum activity, low application rates, low mammalian toxicity, upward systemic movement in plants, and versatile application methods. Their distribution throughout the plant, including pollen, nectar, and guttation fluids, poses particular concern for exposure to pollinators. The authors describe how neonicotinoids interact with the nervous system of honeybees and affect individual honeybees in laboratory situations. Because honeybees are social insects, colony effects in semifield and field studies are discussed. The authors conclude with a review of current and proposed guidance in the United States and Europe for assessing the risks of pesticides to honeybees.

Nosema ceranae DNA in honey bee haemolymph and honey bee mite Varroa destructor	Honey bee mite Varroa destructor and microsporidium Nosema ceranae are currently considered the most important threats to honey bees and beekeeping. It has been believed that both N. apis and N. ceranae invade exclusively epithelial cells of the honey bee ventriculus. However, some findings suggest that these microsporidia may infect other tissues of honey bees. There are indications that these pathogens could be found in honey bee haemolymph, as the medium for its distribution to anatomically distant tissues. Knowing that V. destructor being an ectoparasitic mite feeds on the honey bee's haemolymph, the aim of this study was to investigate if DNA of Nosema spp. microsporidia could be found in honey bee haemolymph and in V. destructor.			2014-01-01
A survey on some factors potentially affecting losses of managed honey bee colonies in Luxembourg over the winters 2010/2011 and 2011/2012	The beekeepers of Luxembourg were asked for: 1. the honey bee (Apis mellifera) colony losses they experienced over winter; and 2. aspects of their beekeeping practice in May 2011 and 2012. Results on the magnitude of the winter losses in the managed bee colonies of Luxembourg are reported for the first time, and some factors potentially related to the losses such as varroa control methods, agricultural land use at the level of municipalities and the hive types employed were investigated. The number of managed honey bee colonies lost in Luxembourg was 938 out of 5,580 in winter 2010/11 and 1,172 out of 5,382 in winter 2011/12, corresponding to national loss rates of 16.8% and 21.8%, respectively. Elevated loss rates were observed in the Northern municipalities in both years. The losses reported from apiaries employing the hive types Dadant 10 or Dadant 12 were significantly lower compared to apiaries employing the hive type Deutsch Normal and losses with Dadant 12 were lower compared to hive type Alberti. Varroa control methods were grouped according to similarity concerning timing and treatment combinations. Differences of colony losses (%) between the four largest groups of similar treatment combinations were non-significant at P = 0.72, indicating that none of the most common varroa control method combinations reduced colony losses significantly below the average percentage of colonies lost per apiary. Evidence for an effect of the interaction between varroa control methods and hive type as well as for agricultural land use on colony losses is presented and discussed. © IBRA 2014.			2014-01-01
Identification and abiotic stress response of a glutamine synthetase gene (AccGS) from the asiatic honeybee, apis cerana cerana (hymenoptera: Apidae)	Glutamine synthetase (GS) is an essential detoxification enzyme that plays an important role in stress responses; however, little information regarding the function of this enzyme in hymenopteran insects is available. In the present study, we isolated and characterized the gene encoding GS in the Asiatic honeybee, Apis cerana cerana. Multiple alignments and a phylogenetic analysis of GS sequences showed that AccGS belongs to the GSII superfamily and clusters with invertebrate GSs. Real-time quantitative PCR data demonstrated that AccGS is expressed at all developmental stages and in all tissues, with the highest expression observed in the sixth larval instar and in the brain. Moreover, AccGS expression is highly regulated by environmental stress, including xenobiotic, temperature, and ultraviolet light stresses. A disc diffusion assay showed that the recombinant AccGS protein confers resistance to mercuric chloride (HgCl2) stress in E. coli. This suggests that AccGS may play multiple roles in early development and in environmental stress responses.		environmental stress, enzyme, gene expression, honeybee, phylogenetics, polymerase chain reaction	2014-01-01
Contextualising pollination benefits: Effect of insecticide and fungicide use on fruit set and weight from bee pollination in lowbush blueberry	Current approaches to determining the value of insect pollinators to crop yield assume that plants are primarily pollen limited. This is particularly relevant in a crop such as lowbush blueberry, Vaccinium angustifolium, where no fruit will set without insect-mediated cross-pollination. However, such valuations usually ignore other factors that are necessary to maximise crop yields. We conducted an experiment to test whether yields of lowbush blueberry attributed to pollinator activity increased independently of pest management. The experiment was a 2 × 2 factorial design, incorporating two intensities of pollination (25% or 100% of flowers), and two levels of insect and disease management with recommended fungicide and insecticide sprays ('full inputs' or 'no inputs'). We demonstrated an interaction between these two factors, such that increased fruit set at harvest was only possible if 100% pollination was combined with the 'full input' treatment. Furthermore, increases in fruit weight among the remaining treatments were only realised in the 'full input' plots. These results suggest that the value accorded to pollinator activity in blueberries is strongly dependent upon pest and disease management of the crop. © 2014 Association of Applied Biologists.		bee, crop yield, dicotyledon, disease control, entomophily, fruit set, fungicide, insecticide, pest control, spray, weight, Apoidea, Bombus impatiens, Hexapoda, Vaccinium, Vaccinium angustifolium	2014-01-01
Graph theoretical modelling and analysis of fragile honey bee pollination network	Due to environmental stress honey bees frequently make foraging shifts. Encounter with any nonflowering agent during such shifts leads to colony collapse. To assess the impact of non-flowering agents in the pollination network, we have modelled the pollination network as polligraphs using graph theoretical tools. Based on the outcome of the model we have extracted a few new network parameters and characterized the stability of the pollination network.		Apis mellifera	2014-01-01
Honeybee pathogens and their management	Knowledge on diseases and the pathogens have become a major topic recently due to alarming diseases and environmental threats, some of which have increased significantly over the last 5-10 years. Certain honey bee diseases have been shown to play a significant role in increased honey bee colony mortality and in the described colony losses. Several bee pathogens which are thought to be involved in such honey bee colony losses necessitate globally valid solution to honey bee decline. Moreover, we need to move from the mere detection of bee pathogens in individuals and colonies to molecular bee pathology focusing on host — (vector)pathogen interactions with equal emphasis on the pathogen (the vector) and the host. This chapter will focus on selected bee pathogens which are considered current threats to honey bees and beekeeping and current measures to combat these emerging issues. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.			2014-01-01
Slow bee paralysis virus and its transmission in honey bee pupae by varroa destructor	The role of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor in the transmission of slow bee paralysis virus (SBPV) was investigated. Virus transmission experiments were done in two seasons (July and September) using pupae of the honey bee, Apis mellifera and mites that had fed on SBPV-infected pupae (as the virus acquisition source or VAS) for either five or ten days (as the virus acquisition period or VAP). The doses necessary to cause 50 and 99% mortality in bees were estimated as 362 (LD50) and 2266 (LD99) particles of virus using Probit analysis. A time course of SBPV replication in pupae showed that the virus was first detected 42 hours after injection. No significant differences were found in the overall proportion of pupae that became infected when mites were permitted a VAP of five or ten days, irrespective of the season (July or September). The proportion of pupae infected with SBPV declined significantly with each mite transfer over time, with the majority of pupae becoming infected after the first few mite transfers. This strongly suggests that transmission of SBPV does occur during mite feeding. However, because SBPV is also highly virulent, killing the bee rapidly and before significant virus replication, this virus remains rare in honey bee colonies even in the presence of V. destructor. © IBRA 2013.			2014-01-01
Analysis of the RdRp, intergenic and structural polyprotein regions, and the complete genome sequence of Kashmir bee virus from infected honeybees (Apis mellifera) in Korea	Kashmir bee virus (KBV) is one of the most common viral infections in honeybees. In this study, a phylogenetic analysis was performed using nine partial nucleotide sequences of RdRp and the structural polyprotein regions of South Korean KBV genotypes, as well as nine previously reported KBV genotypes from various countries and two closely related genotypes of Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) and Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV). The Korean KBV genotypes were highly conserved with 94-99 % shared identity, but they also shared 88-95 % identity with genotypes from various countries, and they formed a separate KBV cluster in the phylogenetic tree. The complete genome sequence of Korean KBV was also determined and aligned with previously reported complete reference genome sequences of KBV, IAPV, and ABPV to compare different genomic regions. The complete Korean KBV genome shared 93, 79, and 71 % similarity with the complete reference genomes of KBV, IAPV, and ABPV, respectively. The Korean KBV was highly conserved relative to the reference KBV genomes in the intergenic and 3′ untranslated region (UTR), but it had a highly variable 5′ UTR, whereas there was little divergence in the helicase and 3C-protease of the nonstructural protein, and the external domains of the structural polyprotein region. Thus, genetic recombination and geographical distance may explain the genomic variations between the Korean and reference KBV genotypes. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.		helicase, polyprotein, protein RdRp, proteinase, spacer DNA, unclassified drug, virus protein, polyprotein, RNA directed RNA polymerase, virus protein, virus RNA, 3' untranslated region, 5' untranslated region, adult, Apis mellifera, article, controlled study, Dicistroviridae, gene sequence, genotype, Israeli acute paralysis virus, Kashmir bee virus, nonhuman, nucleotide sequence, phylogenetic tree, phylogeny, priority journal, protein domain, sequence alignment, South Korea, virus genome, animal, bee, cluster analysis, Dicistroviridae, DNA sequence, genetics, isolation and purification, molecular genetics, sequence homology, virology, Acute bee paralysis virus, Apis mellifera, Kashmir bee virus, Animals, Bees, Cluster Analysis, Dicistroviridae, Genome, Viral, Molecular Sequence Data, Phylogeny, Polyproteins, Republic of Korea, RNA Replicase, RNA, Viral, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Sequence Homology, Viral Proteins	2014-01-01
Honey bees, neonicotinoids and bee incident reports: The Canadian situation	BACKGROUND: Neonicotinoid insecticides have been the target of much scrutiny as possible causes of recent declines observed in pollinator populations. Although neonicotinoids have been implicated in honey bee pesticide incidents, there has been little examination of incident report data. Here we summarize honey bee incident report data obtained from the Canadian Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA). RESULTS: In Canada, there were very few honey bee incidents reported in 2007-2011 and data were not collected prior to 2007. In 2012, a significant number of incidents were reported in the province of Ontario, where exposure to neonicotinoid dust during planting of corn was suspected to have caused the incident in up to 70% of cases. Most of these incidents were classified as 'minor' by the PMRA, and only six cases were considered 'moderate' or 'major'. In that same year, there were over three times as many moderate or major incidents due to older non-neonicotinoid pesticides, involving numbers of hives or bees far greater than the number of moderate or major incidents suspected to be due to neonicotinoid poisoning. CONCLUSIONS: These data emphasize that, while exposure of honey bees to neonicotinoid-contaminated dust during corn planting needs to be mitigated, other pesticides also pose a risk. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.		anabasine, insecticide, analogs and derivatives, animal, bee, Canada, drug effects, toxicity, Anabasine, Animals, Bees, Canada, Insecticides	2014-01-01
Cytotoxic effects of thiamethoxam in the midgut and malpighian tubules of Africanized Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae)	Due to its expansion, agriculture has become increasingly dependent on the use of pesticides. However, the indiscriminate use of insecticides has had additional effects on the environment. These products have a broad spectrum of action, and therefore the insecticide affects not only the pests but also non-target insects such as bees, which are important pollinators of agricultural crops and natural environments. Among the most used pesticides, the neonicotinoids are particularly harmful. One of the neonicotinoids of specific concern is thiamethoxam, which is used on a wide variety of crops and is toxic to bees. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the effects of this insecticide in the midgut and Malpighian tubule cells of Africanized Apis mellifera. Newly emerged workers were exposed until 8 days to a diet containing a sublethal dose of thiamethoxam equal to 1/10 of LC50 (0.0428 ng a.i./l L of diet). The bees were dissected and the organs were processed for transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that thiamethoxam is cytotoxic to midgut and Malpighian tubules. In the midgut, the damage was more evident in bees exposed to the insecticide on the first day. On the eighth day, the cells were ultrastructurally intact suggesting a recovery of this organ. The Malpighian tubules showed pronounced alterations on the eighth day of exposure of bees to the insecticide. This study demonstrates that the continuous exposure to a sublethal dose of thiamethoxam can impair organs that are used during the metabolism of the insecticide. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Autumn invasion rates of varroa destructor (Mesostigmata: Varroidae) into honey bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) colonies and the resulting increase in mite populations	The honey bee parasite Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman can disperse and invade honey bee colonies by attaching to "drifting" and "robbing" honey bees that move into nonnatal colonies. We quantified the weekly invasion rates and the subsequent mite population growth from the end of July to November 2011 in 28 honey bee colonies kept in two apiaries that had high (HBD) and low (LBD) densities of neighboring colonies. At each apiary, half (seven) of the colonies were continuously treated with acaricides to kill all Varroa mites and thereby determine the invasion rates. The other group of colonies was only treated before the beginning of the experiment and then left untreated to record Varroa population growth until a final treatment in November. The numbers of bees and brood cells of all colonies were estimated according to the Liebefeld evaluation method. The invasion rates varied among individual colonies but revealed highly significant differences between the study sites. The average invasion rate per colony over the entire 3.5-mo period ranged from 266 to 1,171 mites at the HBD site compared with only 72 to 248 mites at the LBD apiary. In the untreated colonies, the Varroa population reached an average final infestation in November of 2,082 mites per colony (HBD) and 340 mites per colony (LBD). All colonies survived the winter; however, the higher infested colonies lost about three times more bees compared with the lower infested colonies. Therefore, mite invasion and late-year population growth must be considered more carefully for future treatment concepts in temperate regions. © 2014 Entomological Society of America. © 2014 Entomological Society of America.		animal, animal dispersal, apiculture, article, bee, Germany, parasitology, physiology, population dynamics, season, Varroidae, Animal Distribution, Animals, Beekeeping, Bees, Germany, Population Dynamics, Seasons, Varroidae	2014-01-01
Virulence and polar tube protein genetic diversity of Nosema ceranae (Microsporidia) field isolates from Northern and Southern Europe in honeybees (Apis mellifera iberiensis)	Infection of honeybees by the microsporidian Nosema ceranae is considered to be one of the factors underlying the increased colony losses and decreased honey production seen in recent years. However, these effects appear to differ in function of the climatic zone, the distinct beekeeping practices and the honeybee species employed. Here, we compared the response of Apis mellifera iberiensis worker bees to experimental infection with field isolates of N.ceranae from an Oceanic climate zone in Northern Europe (Netherlands) and from a Mediterranean region of Southern Europe (Spain). We found a notable but non-significant trend (P=0.097) towards higher honeybee survival for bees infected with N.ceranae from the Netherlands, although no differences were found between the two isolates in terms of anatomopathological lesions in infected ventricular cells or the morphology of the mature and immature stages of the parasite. In addition, the population genetic survey of the N. ceranaePTP3 locus revealed high levels of genetic diversity within each isolate, evidence for meiotic recombination, and no signs of differentiation between the Dutch and Spanish populations. A cross-infection study is needed to further explore the differences in virulence observed between the two N.ceranae populations in field conditions. © 2013 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.		fungal protein, animal, bee, classification, DNA sequence, genetic variability, genetics, growth, development and aging, microbiology, molecular genetics, Netherlands, Nosema, physiology, Spain, survival, Animals, Bees, Fungal Proteins, Genetic Variation, Molecular Sequence Data, Netherlands, Nosema, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Spain, Survival Analysis	2014-01-01
A comparative study of environmental conditions, Bee management and the epidemiological situation in apiaries varying in the level of colony losses	Explaining the reasons for the increased mortality of the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) in recent years, in Europe and North America, has become a global research priority in apicultural science. Our project was aimed at determining the relationship between environmental conditions, beekeeping techniques, the epidemiological situation of pathogens, and the mortality rate of bee colonies. Dead bee samples were collected by beekeepers from 2421 colonies. The samples were examined for the presence of V. destructor, Nosema spp. (Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae), chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV), acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), deformed wing virus (DWV), and Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV).

Colliding with reality: Liquid modernity and the environment	The defining feature of (post)modern environmentalism is its focus on damage to ecosystems, including the global ecosystem or Gaia. Its proponents argue that this damage now threatens the future of life itself. They have not succeeded in overturning the current priorities of governments, however, particularly on the crucial measures required to combat climate destabilization. This failure has crystallized a much stronger ideological challenge by radical environmentalists who have rediscovered the Radical Enlightenment and are defining its realization as the creation of an ecologcal civilization. This challenge, in turn, has exposed more clearly the obstacles in the way of creating such a civilization, notably the advance of “inverted totalitarianism” whereby anew global ruling class, the “corporatocracy,” has aligned itself with and utilized morally and intellectually stunted “post-humans” to subvert the institutions of democracy. The nature of this inverted totalitarianism and those who are serving it are examined. Despitethe apparent success of this form of totalitarianism, it is shown that environmentalists have grounds for hope. They still could prevail inthe long run, although success will require a long struggle. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.			2014-01-01
Protecting honey bees: identification of a new varroacide by in silico, in vitro, and in vivo studies	Varroa destructor is the main concern related to the gradual decline of honeybees. Nowadays, among the various acaricides used in the control of V. destructor, most presents increasing resistance. An interesting alternative could be the identification of existent molecules as new acaricides with no effect on honeybee health. We have previously constructed the first 3D model of AChE for honeybee. By analyzing data concerning amino acid mutations implicated in the resistance associated to pesticides, it appears that pirimicarb should be a good candidate for varroacide. To check this hypothesis, we characterized the AChE gene of V. destructor. In the same way, we proposed a 3D model for the AChE of V. destructor. Starting from the definition of these two 3D models of AChE in honeybee and varroa, a comparison between the gorges of the active site highlighted some major differences and particularly different shapes. Following this result, docking studies have shown that pirimicarb adopts two distinct positions with the strongest intermolecular interactions with VdAChE. This result was confirmed with in vitro and in vivo data for which a clear inhibition of VdAChE by pirimicarb at 10 μM (contrary to HbAChE) and a 100 % mortality of varroa (dose corresponding to the LD50 (contact) for honeybee divided by a factor 100) were observed. These results demonstrate that primicarb could be a new varroacide candidate and reinforce the high relationships between in silico, in vitro, and in vivo data for the design of new selective pesticides. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.		acetylcholinesterase, amino acid, pirimicarb, acaricide, carbamic acid derivative, cholinesterase inhibitor, pyrimidine derivative, Article, computer model, controlled study, gene mutation, gene sequence, honeybee, in vitro study, in vivo study, LD 50, molecular docking, molecular model, mortality, nonhuman, Varroa destructor, amino acid sequence, animal, bee, chemical structure, chemistry, drug effects, enzymology, molecular genetics, nucleotide sequence, parasitology, physiology, sequence alignment, Varroidae, Apis mellifera, Varroa, Varroa destructor, Acaricides, Acetylcholinesterase, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Base Sequence, Bees, Carbamates, Cholinesterase Inhibitors, Models, Molecular, Molecular Docking Simulation, Molecular Sequence Data, Pyrimidines, Sequence Alignment, Varroidae	2014-01-01
Determination of pesticide residues in honeybees using modified QUEChERS sample work-up and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry	Increasing emissions of chemical compounds to the environment, especially of pesticides, is one of factors that may explain present honeybee colony losses. In this work, an analytical method employing liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was optimized for the simultaneous screening of 19 pesticides which have not been yet determined in honeybee samples from northern Poland (Pomerania). The sample preparation, based on the QuEChERS method combining salting-out liquid-liquid extraction to acetonitrile and a dispersive-SPE clean-up, was adjusted to honeybee samples by adding a small amount of hexane to eliminate beeswax. The recovery of analytes ranged from 70% to 120% with relative standard deviation =20%. The limits of detection were in the range of 0.91-25 ng/g. A total of 19 samples of honeybees from suspected pesticide poisoning incidents were analyzed, in which 19 different pesticides were determined.© 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.		pesticide residue, animal, article, bee, chemistry, environmental monitoring, liquid chromatography, sensitivity and specificity, tandem mass spectrometry, Animals, Bees, Chromatography, Liquid, Environmental Monitoring, Pesticide Residues, Sensitivity and Specificity, Tandem Mass Spectrometry	2014-01-01
The immune response of the small interfering RNA pathway in the defense against bee viruses	Most bee viruses are RNA viruses belonging to two major families of Dicistroviridae and Iflaviridae. During viral infection, virus-derived double stranded RNAs activate a major host innate immune pathway, namely the small interfering RNAs pathway (siRNA pathway), which degrades the viral RNA or the viral genome. This results in 21-22 nucleotide-long virus-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs). Recent studies showed that vsiRNAs, matching to viruses from the family of Dicistroviridae and Iflaviridae, were generated in infected bees. Moreover, higher virus titers in honeybees also resulted in higher amounts of vsiRNAs, demonstrating that the siRNA response is proportional to the intensity of viral infection. Intriguingly, non-specific dsRNA could also trigger an immune response, leading to the restriction of the viral infection, however this mechanism is still unclear. Other findings demonstrated that bees can be protected through introducing virus specific-dsRNA to activate the siRNA response against the target virus. The latter is highlighting a new strategy to tackle bee viruses. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.			2014-01-01
Quantifying and mapping ecosystem services: Demand and supply of pollination in the European Union	Biotic pollination is an important ecosystem service for the production of many food crops. The supply of pollination is mostly studied at the landscape scale while recent studies on the demand for pollination services provide a global-scale picture based on aggregate national-level data. This paper quantifies both demand and supply of pollination in the European Union (EU) at a relatively high spatial resolution, allowing an analysis of the match between demand and supply. Finally, we evaluate how policies interact with the spatial differences between demand and supply of this ecosystem service. We mapped the crop area requiring pollination for optimal production (demand) and both bee habitat and related visitation probability (supply) using detailed agricultural and landscape data. We compared the maps of demand and supply by visual comparison, descriptive statics and a trend surface generalized additive model to analyze the relation between visitation probability and the presence or absence of pollinator dependent crops. A sensitivity analysis was done to test the robustness of the pollination supply model. Finally, the impact of EU Biodiversity Strategy and Biofuel Directive were evaluated by identifying areas where these policies would influence the demand or supply of pollination. In the EU, 12% of the total cropland area was dependent on pollinators for optimal agricultural production. Pollinator habitat is especially abundant in mosaic landscapes as found in hilly and mountainous areas. Although covering less than 0.5% of the agricultural area, the presence of green linear elements increased the visitation probability by 5-20% while being the sole providers of pollinators in 12% of the croplands. In half of the area with a high pollination demand, the supply of pollination is also high. Irrespective of the different parameterizations, total habitat areas and visitation probability were highest in croplands without pollinator dependent crops and lowest in hotspots of pollination demand. The analysis of the match between pollination supply and demand for this service indicates that for improving or ensuring pollination one must consider both the demand and supply of the process of crop pollination for optimal results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Differential insecticide susceptibility of the Neotropical stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata and the honey bee Apis mellifera	The toxicity of three insecticides frequently used in Neotropical tomato cultivation (abamectin, deltamethrin, and methamidophos) was estimated on foragers of the Neotropical stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata (Lep.) and the honey bee Apis mellifera (L.). Our results showed that the susceptibility varied significantly with the type of exposure (ingestion, topical, or contact), and there were significant differences between species. While M. quadrifasciata was usually more susceptible to insecticides (except for abamectin) in realistic exposures (via ingestion and contact) than A. mellifera, the former was less susceptible than A. mellifera to topically applied insecticides, a less realistic means of insecticide exposure. These findings challenge the common extrapolation of toxicity bioassays with A. mellifera to all (native) bee pollinators. Such equivocated extrapolation may compromise the significant services provided by native bees in Neotropical ecosystems. © 2014 INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		abamectin, cultivation, deltamethrin, honeybee, insecticide, pollinator, pollution exposure, toxicity	2014-01-01
Resistance of developing honeybee larvae during chronic exposure to dietary nicotine	The effects of pesticides on honeybee larvae are less understood than for adult bees, even though larvae are chronically exposed to pesticide residues that accumulate in comb and food stores in the hive. We investigated how exposure to a plant alkaloid, nicotine, affects survival, growth and body composition of honeybee larvae. Larvae of Apis mellifera scutellata were reared in vitro and fed throughout development on standard diets with nicotine included at concentrations from 0 to 1000. μg/100. g diet. Overall mortality across all nicotine treatments was low, averaging 9.8% at the prepupal stage and 18.1% at the white-eyed pupal stage, but survival was significantly reduced by nicotine. The mass of prepupae and white-eyed pupae was not affected by nicotine. In terms of body composition, nicotine affected water content but did not influence either protein or lipid stores of white-eyed pupae. We attribute the absence of consistent negative effects of dietary nicotine to detoxification mechanisms in developing honeybees, which enable them to resist both natural and synthetic xenobiotics. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.		insect protein, insecticide, lipid, nicotine, animal, bee, body composition, body weight, chemistry, drug effects, growth, development and aging, larva, nutrition, pupa, Animals, Bees, Body Composition, Body Weight, Insect Proteins, Insecticides, Larva, Lipids, Nicotine, Nutrition Processes, Pupa	2014-01-01
Differential proteomic analysis of midguts from Nosema ceranae-infected honeybees reveals manipulation of key host functions	Many invasive pathogens effectively bypass the insect defenses to ensure the completion of their life cycle. Among those, an invasive microsporidian species, Nosema ceranae, can cause nosemosis in honeybees. N. ceranae was first described in the Asian honeybee Apis cerana and is suspected to be involved in Western honeybee (Apis mellifera) declines worldwide. The midgut of honeybees is the first barrier against N. ceranae attacks. To bring proteomics data on honeybee/. N. ceranae crosstalk and more precisely to decipher the worker honeybee midgut response after an oral inoculation of N. ceranae (10. days post-infection), we used 2D-DIGE (2-Dimensional Differential In-Gel Electrophoresis) combined with mass spectrometry. Forty-five protein spots produced by the infected worker honeybee group were shown to be differentially expressed when compared to the uninfected group; 14 were subsequently identified by mass spectrometry. N. ceranae mainly caused a modulation of proteins involved in three key host biological functions: (i) energy production, (ii) innate immunity (reactive oxygen stress) and (iii) protein regulation. The modulation of these host biological functions suggests that N. ceranae creates a zone of "metabolic habitat modification" in the honeybee midgut favoring its development by enhancing availability of nutrients and reducing the worker honeybee defense. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.		insect protein, animal, bee, host pathogen interaction, metabolism, microbiology, Nosema, physiology, procedures, protein protein interaction, proteomics, Animals, Bees, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Insect Proteins, Nosema, Protein Interaction Maps, Proteomics	2014-01-01
A survey of managed honey bee colony losses in the Republic of South Africa - 2009 to 2011	This study reports honey bee, Apis mellifera L., colony losses that occurred in South Africa over two consecutive years. The total losses were 29.6% (95% CI: 22.8-37.5) in 2009-2010 and 46.2% (95% CI: 37.3-55.0) in 2010-2011. Furthermore, the study shows that the capensis worker social parasite, a problem unique to southern Africa, is the main perceived cause, and could explain the significant differences in the number of losses between beekeepers using the subspecies A. m. scutellata and those using the subspecies A. m. capensis. In contrast to previous studies in North America and Europe, we find a significant negative effect of migratory beekeeping practices on the extent of colony losses. Migratory beekeepers lost on average more colonies (35.5% (95% CI 29.7-47.2)) than did stationary beekeepers (17.2% (95% CI 11.2-22.3)). This was especially pronounced when the beekeepers were migrating for the pollination of apples/cherries, eucalyptus, onions and/or sunflowers. The major beekeeper-perceived causes of mortality were small hive beetles, varroa mites, absconding (non-reproductive swarming), and chalkbrood disease. Those listing chalkbrood disease lost significantly fewer colonies than those who did not list chalkbrood. The exact mechanism for this difference is unknown, and may be related to other beekeeping practices that correlate with finding chalkbrood infections - namely more intensive inspection and management. © IBRA 2014.			2014-01-01
Results of international standardised beekeeper surveys of colony losses for winter 2012-2013: Analysis of winter loss rates and mixed effects modelling of risk factors for winter loss	This article presents results of an analysis of winter losses of honey bee colonies from 19 mainly European countries, most of which implemented the standardised 2013 COLOSS questionnaire. Generalised linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) were used to investigate the effects of several factors on the risk of colony loss, including different treatments for Varroa destructor, allowing for random effects of beekeeper and region. Both winter and summer treatments were considered, and the most common combinations of treatment and timing were used to define treatment factor levels. Overall and within country colony loss rates are presented. Significant factors in the model were found to be: percentage of young queens in the colonies before winter, extent of queen problems in summer, treatment of the varroa mite, and access by foraging honey bees to oilseed rape and maize. Spatial variation at the beekeeper level is shown across geographical regions using random effects from the fitted models, both before and after allowing for the effect of the significant terms in the model. This spatial variation is considerable. © IBRA 2014.			2014-01-01
Pathogen-associated self-medication behavior in the honeybee Apis mellifera	Honeybees, Apis mellifera, have several prophylactic disease defense strategies, including the foraging of antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral compounds of plant products. Hence, honey and pollen contain many compounds that prevent fungal and bacterial growth and inhibit viral replication. Since these compounds are also fed to the larvae by nurse bees, they play a central role for colony health inside the hive. Here, we show that honeybee nurse bees, infected with the microsporidian gut parasite Nosema ceranae, show different preferences for various types of honeys in a simultaneous choice test. Infected workers preferred honeys with a higher antibiotic activity that reduced the microsporidian infection after the consumption of the honey. Since nurse bees feed not only the larvae but also other colony members, this behavior might be a highly adaptive form of therapeutic medication at both the individual and the colony level. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.			2014-01-01
Sublethal neonicotinoid insecticide exposure reduces solitary bee reproductive success	Pollinating insects provide crucial and economically important ecosystem services to crops and wild plants, but pollinators, particularly bees, are globally declining as a result of various driving factors, including the prevalent use of pesticides for crop protection. Sublethal pesticide exposure negatively impacts numerous pollinator life-history traits, but its influence on reproductive success remains largely unknown. Such information is pivotal, however, to our understanding of the long-term effects on population dynamics. We investigated the influence of field-realistic trace residues of the routinely used neonicotinoid insecticides thiamethoxam and clothianidin in nectar substitutes on the entire life-time fitness performance of the red mason bee Osmia bicornis. We show that chronic, dietary neonicotinoid exposure has severe detrimental effects on solitary bee reproductive output. Neonicotinoids did not affect adult bee mortality; however, monitoring of fully controlled experimental populations revealed that sublethal exposure resulted in almost 50% reduced total offspring production and a significantly male-biased offspring sex ratio. Our data add to the accumulating evidence indicating that sublethal neonicotinoid effects on non-Apis pollinators are expressed most strongly in a rather complex, fitness-related context. Consequently, to fully mitigate long-term impacts on pollinator population dynamics, present pesticide risk assessments need to be expanded to include whole life-cycle fitness estimates, as demonstrated in the present study using O. bicornis as a model. © 2013 The Royal Entomological Society.

Exposure to neonicotinoids influences the motor function of adult worker honeybees	Systemic pesticides such as neonicotinoids are commonly used on flowering crops visited by pollinators, and their use has been implicated in the decline of insect pollinator populations in Europe and North America. Several studies show that neonicotinoids affect navigation and learning in bees but few studies have examined whether these substances influence their basic motor function. Here, we investigated how prolonged exposure to sublethal doses of four neonicotinoid pesticides (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, dinotefuran) and the plant toxin, nicotine, affect basic motor function and postural control in foraging-age worker honeybees. We used doses of 10 nM for each neonicotinoid: field-relevant doses that we determined to be sublethal and willingly consumed by bees. The neonicotinoids were placed in food solutions given to bees for 24 h. After the exposure period, bees were more likely to lose postural control during the motor function assay and fail to right themselves if exposed to imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin. Bees exposed to thiamethoxam and nicotine also spent more time grooming. Other behaviours (walking, sitting and flying) were not significantly affected. Expression of changes in motor function after exposure to imidacloprid was dose-dependent and affected all measured behaviours. Our data illustrate that 24 h exposure to sublethal doses of neonicotinoid pesticides has a subtle influence on bee behaviour that is likely to affect normal function in a field setting. © 2014, The Author(s).		clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, neonicotinoid, nicotine, thiamethoxam, ((E)-1-(2-chloro-1,3-thiazol-5-ylmethyl)-3-methyl-2-nitroguanidine), guanidine derivative, imidazole derivative, insecticide, nitro derivative, oxazine derivative, thiazole derivative, behavioral response, foraging behavior, honeybee, neonicotinoid, nontarget organism, pollution effect, pollution exposure, sublethal effect, adult, Article, body equilibrium, chemical analysis, cohort analysis, controlled study, environmental exposure, flying, foraging behavior, grooming, honeybee, locomotion, mortality, motor performance, nonhuman, pilot study, pollination, walking, animal, animal behavior, bee, body posture, drug effects, motor activity, physiology, toxicity, toxicity testing, Europe, North America, Apis mellifera, Animals, Bees, Behavior, Animal, Guanidines, Imidazoles, Insecticides, Motor Activity, Nitro Compounds, Oxazines, Posture, Thiazoles, Toxicity Tests, Acute	2014-01-01
Determining the origin of invasions and demonstrating a lack of enemy release from microsporidian pathogens in common wasps (Vespula vulgaris)	Aim: Understanding the role of enemy release in biological invasions requires an assessment of the invader's home range, the number of invasion events and enemy prevalence. The common wasp (Vespula vulgaris) is a widespread invader. We sought to determine the Eurasian origin of this wasp and examined world-wide populations for microsporidian pathogen infections to investigate enemy release. Location: Argentina, Eurasia, New Zealand. Methods: A haplotype network and phylogenetic tree were constructed from combined wasp COI and cytb mitochondrial markers. A morphometric study using canonical discriminant analysis was conducted on wing venation patterns. Microsporidian pathogens prevalence was also examined using small subunit rRNA microsporidia-specific primers. Results: Our spatially structured haplotype network from the native range suggested a longitudinal cline of wasp haplotypes along an east to west gradient. Six haplotypes were detected from New Zealand, and two from Argentina. The populations from the introduced range were genetically similar to the western European, United Kingdom and Ireland. The morphometric analysis showed significant morphological variation between countries and supported the Western European origin for New Zealand populations, although not for Argentine samples. Microsporidian infection rates were highest in New Zealand samples (54%), but no significant differences in infection rates were observed between the invaded and native range. Nosema species included matches to N. apis (a pathogen from honey bees) and N. bombi (from bumble bees). Main conclusions: Multiple introductions of the common wasp have occurred in the invaded range. A high microsporidian infection rate within the native range, combined with multiple introductions and a reservoir of pathogens in other social insects such as bees, likely contributes to the high microsporidian infection rates in the invaded range. Enemy release is likely to be more frequent when pathogens are rare in the home range, or are host specific and rare in reservoir populations of the introduced range. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.		biological invasion, genetic marker, home range, host-pathogen interaction, morphometry, natural enemy, phylogenetics, population structure, social insect, wasp, Argentina, Eurasia, Apis, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Bombus (genus), Hexapoda, Microsporidia, Nosema, Nosema apis, Nosema bombi, Vespula vulgaris	2014-01-01
Honey bee colonies act as reservoirs for two Spiroplasma facultative symbionts and incur complex, multiyear infection dynamics	Two species of Spiroplasma (Mollicutes) bacteria were isolated from and described as pathogens of the European honey bee, Apis mellifera, ~30 years ago but recent information on them is lacking despite global concern to understand bee population declines. Here we provide a comprehensive survey for the prevalence of these two Spiroplasma species in current populations of honey bees using improved molecular diagnostic techniques to assay multiyear colony samples from North America (U.S.A.) and South America (Brazil). Significant annual and seasonal fluctuations of Spiroplasma apis and Spiroplasma melliferum prevalence in colonies from the U.S.A. (n = 616) and Brazil (n = 139) occurred during surveys from 2011 through 2013. Overall, 33% of U.S.A. colonies and 54% of Brazil colonies were infected by Spiroplasma spp., where S. melliferum predominated over S. apis in both countries (25% vs. 14% and 44% vs. 38% frequency, respectively). Colonies were co-infected by both species more frequently than expected in both countries and at a much higher rate in Brazil (52%) compared to the U.S.A. (16.5%). U.S.A. samples showed that both species were prevalent not only during spring, as expected from prior research, but also during other seasons. These findings demonstrate that the model of honey bee spiroplasmas as springtime-restricted pathogens needs to be broadened and their role as occasional pathogens considered in current contexts. © Published 2014.

Overwintered brood comb honey: Colony exposure to pesticide residues	To address beekeeper concerns about pesticide residues in overwintered honey, paired samples were obtained from the extracted supers and the brood chamber of the same colony. Only eight residues were detected: coumaphos, fluvalinate, boscalid, dimethoate, atrazine, bentazon, dichlorobenzene and thymol. Honey from extracted supers was significantly less likely to contain pesticide residues than honey from brood comb. Fluvalinate was detected only in overwintered brood comb honey, and coumaphos was found at significantly higher levels in the overwintered samples from the brood comb-honey super pairs. Pesticide residues in honey, while low in comparison to other substrates in the hive, contribute to the overall pesticide exposure of honey bees, with overwintered brood comb honey contributing more than honey stored in other locations in the hive. © IBRA 2014.			2014-01-01
Host species and developmental stage, but not host social structure, affects bacterial community structure in socially polymorphic bees	Social transmission and host developmental stage are thought to profoundly affect the structure of bacterial communities associated with honey bees and bumble bees, but these ideas have not been explored in other bee species. The halictid bees Megalopta centralis and M. genalis exhibit intrapopulation social polymorphism, which we exploit to test whether bacterial communities differ by host social structure, developmental stage, or host species. We collected social and solitary Megalopta nests and sampled bees and nest contents from all stages of host development. To survey these bacterial communities, we used 16S rRNA gene 454 pyrosequencing. We found no effect of social structure, but found differences by host species and developmental stage. Wolbachia prevalence differed between the two host species. Bacterial communities associated with different developmental stages appeared to be driven by environmentally acquired bacteria. A Lactobacillus kunkeei clade bacterium that is consistently associated with other bee species was dominant in pollen provisions and larval samples, but less abundant in mature larvae and pupae. Foraging adults appeared to often reacquire L. kunkeei clade bacteria, likely while foraging at flowers. Environmental transmission appears to be more important than social transmission for Megalopta bees at the cusp between social and solitary behavior. © 2014 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Impact of chronic exposure to a pyrethroid pesticide on bumblebees and interactions with a trypanosome parasite	Summary: Bees are exposed to pesticides when foraging in agricultural areas and growing evidence suggests that such compounds can be harmful to managed and wild populations. Given the economic and ecological importance of bees, and the evidence of widespread population declines, the full impacts of pesticides and their interactions with other stressors in the environment need to be investigated. Here, we focus on the impacts of chronic exposure to the commonly used pyrethroid pesticide lambda (λ)-cyhalothrin on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris at both the individual and colony level. Furthermore, we investigated the interactions of pesticide exposure with a highly prevalent trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi. Colonies were exposed to λ-cyhalothrin in the laboratory, and colony growth and reproductive output were monitored for up to 14 weeks. The potential interactions between the pesticide and C. bombi were investigated by quantifying the impact of pesticide treatment on susceptibility to, and success of experimental infections, as well as the survival of workers. Male survival after larval pesticide exposure was also monitored. Pesticide-treated colonies produced workers with a significantly lower body mass. However, out of the twelve variables of colony development measured, this was the only metric that was significantly affected by pesticide treatment and there was no subsequent significant impact on the reproductive output of colonies. Lambda-cyhalothrin had no significant impact on the susceptibility of workers to C. bombi, or intensity of parasitic infection. Pesticide exposure did not cause differential survival in workers or males, even when workers were additionally challenged with C. bombi. Synthesis and applications. Chronic exposure to λ-cyhalothrin has a significant impact on worker size, a key aspect of bumblebee colony function, particularly under conditions of limited food resources. This could indicate that under times of resource limitation, colonies exposed to this pesticide in the field may fail. However, the lack of other impacts found in this study indicate that further field trials are needed to elucidate this. © 2013 The Authors.

Bacterial chitinase with phytopathogen control capacity from suppressive soil revealed by functional metagenomics	Plant disease caused by fungal pathogens results in vast crop damage globally. Microbial communities of soil that is suppressive to fungal crop disease provide a source for the identification of novel enzymes functioning as bioshields against plant pathogens. In this study, we targeted chitin-degrading enzymes of the uncultured bacterial community through a functional metagenomics approach, using a fosmid library of a suppressive soil metagenome. We identified a novel bacterial chitinase, Chi18H8, with antifungal activity against several important crop pathogens. Sequence analyses show that the chi18H8 gene encodes a 425-amino acid protein of 46 kDa with an N-terminal signal peptide, a catalytic domain with the conserved active site F175DGIDIDWE183, and a chitinase insertion domain. Chi18H8 was expressed (pGEX-6P-3 vector) in Escherichia coli and purified. Enzyme characterization shows that Chi18H8 has a prevalent chitobiosidase activity with a maximum activity at 35°C at pH lower than 6, suggesting a role as exochitinase on native chitin. To our knowledge, Chi18H8 is the first chitinase isolated from a metagenome library obtained in pure form and which has the potential to be used as a candidate agent for controlling fungal crop diseases. Furthermore, Chi18H8 may also answer to the demand for novel chitin-degrading enzymes for a broad range of other industrial processes and medical purposes. © The Author(s) 2013.

Mathematical Programming Models for Determining the Optimal Location of Beehives	Farmers frequently decide where to locate the colonies of their domesticated eusocial bees, especially given the following mutually exclusive scenarios: (i) there are limited nectar and pollen sources within the vicinity of the apiary that cause competition among foragers; and (ii) there are fewer pollinators compared to the number of inflorescence that may lead to suboptimal pollination of crops. We hypothesize that optimally distributing the beehives in the apiary can help address the two scenarios stated above. In this paper, we develop quantitative models (specifically using linear programming) for addressing the two given scenarios. We formulate models involving the following factors: (i) fuzzy preference of the beekeeper; (ii) number of available colonies; (iii) unknown-but-bounded strength of colonies; (iv) probabilistic carrying capacity of the plant clusters; and (v) spatial orientation of the apiary. © 2014 Society for Mathematical Biology.

Lethal and sub-lethal effects of thymol on honeybee (Apis mellifera) larvae reared in vitro	BACKGROUND: Thymol offers an attractive alternative to synthetic chemicals to keep Varroa under control. However, thymol accumulates in bee products and is suspected of having adverse effects on colonies and especially on larvae. In this study, we investigated the effects of acute and chronic exposure to thymol on larvae reared in vitro with contaminated food and compared results to the theoretical larval exposure based on the amount of pollen and honey consumed by larvae during their development. RESULTS: The laboratory assays reveal that, first, the 48h-LD50 of thymol introduced into larval food is 0.044mg larva-1. Second, the 6day-LC50 is 700mgkg-1 food. A significant decrease of larval survival and mass occurred from 500mg thymol kg-1 food (P < 0.0001). Finally, vitellogenin expression, which reached a maximum at the fifth instar larvae, is delayed for individuals exposed to 50mg thymol kg-1 food (P < 0.0006). That is 10 times higher than the theoretical level of exposure. CONCLUSION: Based on the level of thymol residue found in honey and pollen, these results suggest that the contamination of food by thymol represents no notable risk for the early-developing larvae. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.		bioaccumulation, bioassay, honeybee, larva, rearing, sublethal effect, toxicity, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Varroa, insecticide, thymol, vitellogenin, animal, animal behavior, article, bee, drug effect, honeybee, in vitro rearing, larva, physiology, toxicity, honeybee, in vitro rearing, thymol, toxicity, vitellogenin, Animals, Bees, Behavior, Animal, Insecticides, Larva, Thymol	2014-01-01
Chronic impairment of bumblebee natural foraging behaviour induced by sublethal pesticide exposure	Insect pollination is a vital ecosystem service that maintains biodiversity and sustains agricultural crop yields. Social bees are essential insect pollinators, so it is concerning that their populations are in global decline. Although pesticide exposure has been implicated as a possible cause for bee declines, we currently have a limited understanding of the risk these chemicals pose. Whilst environmental exposure to pesticides typically has non-lethal effects on individual bees, recent reports suggest that sublethal exposure can affect important behavioural traits such as foraging. However, at present, we know comparatively little about how natural foraging behaviour is impaired and the relative impacts of acute and chronic effects. Using Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging technology, we examined how the day-to-day foraging patterns of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were affected when exposed to either a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and/or a pyrethroid (λ-cyhalothrin) independently and in combination over a four-week period. This is the first study to provide data on the impacts of combined and individual pesticide exposure on the temporal dynamics of foraging behaviour in the field over a prolonged period of time. Our results show that neonicotinoid exposure has both acute and chronic effects on overall foraging activity. Whilst foragers from control colonies improved their pollen foraging performance as they gained experience, the performance of bees exposed to imidacloprid became worse: chronic behavioural impairment. We also found evidence, suggesting that pesticide exposure can change forager preferences for the flower types from which they collect pollen. Our findings highlight the importance of considering prolonged exposure (which happens in the field) when assessing the risk that pesticides pose to bees. The effects of chronic pesticide exposure could have serious detrimental consequences for both colony survival and also the pollination services provided by these essential insect pollinators. © 2014 British Ecological Society.			2014-01-01
Presence of Nosema ceranae associated with honeybee queen introductions	Microsporidiosis caused by Nosema species is one of the factors threatening the health of the honeybee (Apis mellifera), which is an essential element in agriculture mainly due to its pollination function. The dispersion of this pathogen may be influenced by many factors, including various aspects of beekeeping management such as introduction of queens with different origin. Herein we study the relation of the presence and distribution of Nosema spp. and the replacement of queens in honeybee populations settled on the Atlantic Canary Islands. While Nosema apis has not been detected, an increase of the presence and distribution of Nosema ceranae during the last decade has been observed in parallel with a higher frequency of foreign queens. On the other hand, a reduction of the number of N. ceranae positive colonies was observed on those islands with continued replacement of queens. We suggest that such replacement could help maintaining low rates of Nosema infection, but healthy queens native to these islands should be used in order to conserve local honeybee diversity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.		article, controlled study, female, honeybee, infection rate, nonhuman, Nosema, Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae, nosemosis, organism colony, population abundance, priority journal, queen (insect), Spain, spatial analysis, species distribution, species introduction, temporal analysis, animal, bee, classification, ecotype, genetics, introduced species, isolation and purification, microbiology, Nosema, physiology, fungal DNA, Animals, Bees, DNA, Fungal, Ecotype, Introduced Species, Nosema, Spain	2014-01-01
Pesticides, food safety and integrated pest management	A rapidly growing human population has resulted in a demand for increased food production. In ancient times, traditional agriculture could meet human food needs when the size of human population was small. As human population grew, the demand for food increased, which was met by increasing the land area under cultivation. As the land resources became limited, efforts were made to increase productivity by fighting the losses inflicted by insects, weeds, and plant pathogens through the discovery of pesticides. At the same time, pesticides proved to be more dangerous due to their indiscriminate and excessive use, contaminating food (milk, honey, cereals, vegetables, and fruits) and the environment (ground water, soil, etc.), resulting in pest resistance, pest resurgence, and pest outbreaks. Consequently, the need arose for eco-friendly integrated pest management strategies to produce food safe from the negative impact of pesticide residues. The present chapter addresses information on the pesticide usage and their negative impacts on food safety leading to the development of integrated pest management (IPM). In this chapter, IPM for food safety through eco-friendly pesticides is discussed. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.			2014-01-01
Fifty years since silent spring	Rachel Carson's 1962 Silent Spring exposed both observed and potential environmental and health externalities of the increasing organochlorine and organophosphate insecticide use in the United States post-World War II. Silent Spring was a critical component in a popular movement that resulted in increased regulation and the development of safer pesticides. Most changes in pesticide use in the global north have involved pesticide substitutions, although riskier pesticides remain in use. Many ideas in Silent Spring are compatible with the theory of integrated pest management (IPM), and IPM has been broadly embraced in the United States and internationally as a strategy for achieving least-use and/or least-risk pesticide use in agriculture. IPM is a politically feasible policy that purports to reduce pesticide use and/or risk in agriculture but often does not, except in extreme cases of pesticide overuse that result in negative agricultural/economic consequences for growers. ©2014 by Annual Reviews.

The 10 principles of food industry sustainability	Although the food industry is beginning to make headway with its sustainability initiatives, substantially more progress is needed in order to feed the world's growing population sustainably. The challenge is that the topic of sustainability can seem overwhelming and there is limited information that is specific to the food industry. Written by an experienced food industry professional with years of experience in sustainability, The10 Principles of Food Industry Sustainability inspires and informs the progress required to nourish the population, revitalize natural resources, enhance economic development, and close resource loops. The book makes this complex topic approachable and actionable by identifying the most pressing sustainability priorities across the entire food supply chain and showing, with tools and examples, how producers, processors, packers, distributors, marketers and retailers all play a role in advancing improvement. The book begins with an overview of the Principles of sustainability in the food industry: what they are and why they matter. Subsequent chapters focus on each of the Ten Principles in detail: how they relate to the food industry, their global relevance (including their environmental, health, and social impacts), and the best practices to achieve the potential of meaningful and positive progress that the Principles offer. Specific examples from industry are presented in order to provide scalable solutions and bring the concepts to life, along with top resources for further exploration. The Principles, practices, and potential of sustainability in the food industry covered in this book are designed to be motivating and to offer a much-needed and clear way forward towards a sustainable food supply. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Management of whitefly-transmitted viruses in open-field production systems	Whiteflies are a key pest of crops in open-field production throughout the tropics and subtropics. This is due in large part to the long and diverse list of devastating plant viruses transmitted by these vectors. Open-field production provides many challenges to manage these viruses and in many cases adequate management has not been possible. Diseases caused by whitefly-transmitted viruses have become limiting factors in open-field production of a wide range of crops, i.e., bean golden mosaic disease in beans, tomato yellow leaf curl disease in tomato, cassava mosaic disease and cassava brown streak disease in cassava, and cotton leaf crumple disease in cotton. While host resistance has proven to be the most cost-effective management solution, few examples of host resistance have been developed to date. The main strategy to limit the incidence of virus-infected plants has been the application of insecticides to reduce vector populations aided to some extent by the use of selected cultural practices. However, due to concerns about the effect of insecticides on pollinators, consumer demand for reduced pesticide use, and the ability of the whitefly vectors to develop insecticide-resistance, there is a growing need to develop and deploy strategies that do not rely on insecticides. The reduction in pesticide use will greatly increase the need for genetic resistance to more viruses in more crop plants. Resistance combined with selected IPM strategies could become a viable means to increase yields in crops produced in open fields despite the presence of whitefly-transmitted viruses. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.		animal, disease carrier, disease resistance, Hemiptera, insect control, parasitology, physiology, plant, plant disease, prevention and control, procedures, virology, Virus Diseases, Animals, Disease Resistance, Disease Vectors, Hemiptera, Insect Control, Plant Diseases, Plants, Virus Diseases	2014-01-01
Insect acetylcholinesterase as a target for effective and environmentally safe insecticides	Insecticides are a cost-effective approach to managing disease-carrying, crop-destroying, and residential pest insects. However, current anticholinesterase insecticides are toxic to beneficial insects and vertebrates because they target the catalytic serine residue of acetylcholinesterase, a hydrolase vital to the regulation of acetylcholine in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Targeting this serine residue for more than 70 years has also contributed to current problems with insecticide resistance. This chapter presents data undergirding a mechanistically new insecticide concept that targets a cysteine residue unique in pest insect acetylcholinesterase to impart species-selective toxicity and a low propensity for resistance. These data are used to discuss how gainful deployment of the mechanism of irreversible inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase responsible for cholinergic functions in pest insects-but not in social bees and other higher social hymenopterans-may lead to cysteine-targeting anticholinesterases that are effective and environmentally safe in controlling pest insects while sparing economically important beneficial insects. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.			2014-01-01
Characterizing the infection-induced transcriptome of Nasonia vitripennis reveals a preponderance of taxonomically-restricted immune genes	The innate immune system in insects consists of a conserved core signaling network and rapidly diversifying effector and recognition components, often containing a high proportion of taxonomically-restricted genes. In the absence of functional annotation, genes encoding immune system proteins can thus be difficult to identify, as homology-based approaches generally cannot detect lineage-specific genes. Here, we use RNA-seq to compare the uninfected and infection-induced transcriptome in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis to identify genes regulated by infection. We identify 183 genes significantly up-regulated by infection and 61 genes significantly down-regulated by infection. We also produce a new homology-based immune catalog in N. vitripennis, and show that most infection-induced genes cannot be assigned an immune function from homology alone, suggesting the potential for substantial novel immune components in less well-studied systems. Finally, we show that a high proportion of these novel induced genes are taxonomically restricted, highlighting the rapid evolution of immune gene content. The combination of functional annotation using RNA-seq and homology-based annotation provides a robust method to characterize the innate immune response across a wide variety of insects, and reveals significant novel features of the Nasonia immune response. © 2013 Sackton et al.

Microbial ecology of the hive and pollination landscape: Bacterial associates from floral nectar, the alimentary tract and stored food of honey bees (Apis mellifera)	Nearly all eukaryotes are host to beneficial or benign bacteria in their gut lumen, either vertically inherited, or acquired from the environment. While bacteria core to the honey bee gut are becoming evident, the influence of the hive and pollination environment on honey bee microbial health is largely unexplored. Here we compare bacteria from floral nectar in the immediate pollination environment, different segments of the honey bee (Apis mellifera) alimentary tract, and food stored in the hive (honey and packed pollen or "beebread"). We used cultivation and sequencing to explore bacterial communities in all sample types, coupled with culture-independent analysis of beebread. We compare our results from the alimentary tract with both culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses from previous studies. Culturing the foregut (crop), midgut and hindgut with standard media produced many identical or highly similar 16S rDNA sequences found with 16S rDNA clone libraries and next generation sequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons. Despite extensive culturing with identical media, our results do not support the core crop bacterial community hypothesized by recent studies. We cultured a wide variety of bacterial strains from 6 of 7 phylogenetic groups considered core to the honey bee hindgut. Our results reveal that many bacteria prevalent in beebread and the crop are also found in floral nectar, suggesting frequent horizontal transmission. From beebread we uncovered a variety of bacterial phylotypes, including many possible pathogens and food spoilage organisms, and potentially beneficial bacteria including Lactobacillus kunkeei, Acetobacteraceae and many different groups of Actinobacteria. Contributions of these bacteria to colony health may include general hygiene, fungal and pathogen inhibition and beebread preservation. Our results are important for understanding the contribution to pollinator health of both environmentally vectored and core microbiota, and the identification of factors that may affect bacterial detection and transmission, colony food storage and disease susceptibility.

The body composition and enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism of Varroa destructor	The aim of the present research was to determine the basic composition of the organic compounds present in extracts from Varroa destructor, a parasitic mite of the honeybee. The total protein content was 9.16 ± 0.82 mg/100 mg of body weight, lipid content was 9.81 ± 1.99 mg/100 mg, and carbohydrate content was 26.67 ± 4.52 mg/100 mg. The triacylglycerol content was 2.40 ± 0.86 mg/100 mg and the cholesterol content was 0.14 ± 0.02 mg/100 mg. Thin layer chromatography indicated that phospholipids comprised the major part of the lipid component; cephalins (78%), cerebrosides (16%), and lecithins (6%) were identified in the phospholipid pool. Glucose (23.6 ± 4.52 mg/100 mg) was the main carbohydrate, followed by glycogen (5.43 ± 1.23 mg/100 mg) and trehalose (0.35 ± 0.07 mg/100 mg). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays detected two major glycogen metabolism enzymes, glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase. Among the enzymes metabolising disaccharides, maltase (24.7 ± 2.38 μmol/mg protein) and trehalase (14.81 ± 5.21 μmol/mg protein) presented the highest activity. Saccharose and lactose were hydrolysed to a minor extent. These are the first measurements of the basic composition of the mite body. Although these data are not exhaustive, they may serve as the basis for further research on the metabolism of V. destructor, particularly concerning lipid metabolism.			2013-12-01
The rhizobacterium Arthrobacter agilis produces dimethylhexadecylamine, a compound that inhibits growth of phytopathogenic fungi in vitro	Plant diseases caused by fungal pathogens such as Botrytis cinerea and the oomycete Phytophthora cinnamomi affect agricultural production worldwide. Control of these pests can be done by the use of fungicides such as captan, which may have deleterious effects on human health. This study demonstrates that the rhizobacterium Arthrobacter agilis UMCV2 produces volatile organic compounds that inhibit the growth of B. cinerea in vitro. A single compound from the volatile blends, namely dimethylhexadecylamine (DMHDA), could inhibit the growth of both B. cinerea and P. cinnamomi when supplied to the growth medium in low concentrations. DMHDA also inhibited the growth of beneficial fungi Trichoderma virens and Trichoderma atroviride but at much higher concentrations. DMHDA-related aminolipids containing 4, 8, 10, 12, and 14 carbons in the alkyl chain were tested for their inhibitory effect on the growth of the pathogens. The results show that the most active compound from those tested was dimethyldodecylamine. This effect correlates with a decrease in the number of membrane lipids present in the mycelium of the pathogen including eicosanoic acid, (Z)-9-hexadecenoic acid, methyl ester, and (Z)-9-octadecenoic acid, methyl ester. Strawberry leaflets treated with DMHDA were not injured by the compound. These data indicate that DMHDA and related compounds, which can be produced by microorganisms may effectively inhibit the proliferation of certain plant pathogens. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

Short- and long-term effects of neonicotinoid application in rice fields, on the mortality and colony collapse of honeybees (Apis mellifera)	Declines in honeybee (Apis mellifera) colonies have elicited great concern worldwide. Recently, many Japanese beekeepers have implied that midsummer use of a new insecticide, neonicotinoid, in rice fields, is causing widespread mortality of neighboring honeybees and frequently resulting in colony collapse. Since few field experiments have directly tested the effects of neonicotinoids, I addressed four research questions in the field. The questions are: 1) Does clothianidin application in rice fields cause the collapse of neighboring honeybee colonies? 2) Is colony collapse related to hive distance from the rice field? 3) Is the number of dead honeybee workers after spraying, related to hive distance from the field? 4) What are the long-term effects of neonicotinoid use on honeybee colony growth, especially brood production? In the late summer of 2010, honeybee hives were placed adjacent to two separate rice fields for 1 week. The hives were placed at the distance of 0, 30, 60, and 90 m. After spraying clothianidin, a daily count of dead worker honeybees was done for a week. Hives were weighed, and capped-brood areas were estimated weekly, for 2 months following insecticide application. Although the average number of dead workers ranged from 40 to over 100 within 24 hours after spraying, only a few dead workers were observed in the subsequent days. Distance from the rice field had no significant effect on the number of dead workers. There were no collapsed colonies during the 2-month, post-spray observation period. Hive weight and capped-brood area did not significantly differ among those hives placed at varying distances from the rice field. These results indicated that clothianidin spraying of the rice field increased the mortality of the honeybees, but did not always cause colony collapse.			2013-12-01
Effects of exposure of honey bee colonies to neonicotinoid seed-treated maize crops	The effects to honeybee colonies (Apis mellifera L.) during and after exposure to flowering maize (Zea mays L.), grown from seeds coated with clothianidin and imidacloprid was assessed in field-realistic conditions. The experimental maize crops were adjacent to the other flowering agriculture plants. Honey bee colonies were placed in three differently protected maize fields throughout the blooming period, and thereafter they were transferred to a stationary apiary. Samples of pollen loads, bee bread, and adult bees were collected and analyzed for neonicotinoid residues. To ensure high specificity and sensitivity of detection of the analyzed pesticides, a modified QuEChERS extraction method and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry were used. Clothianidin was detected only in the samples of pollen loads. Their residue levels ranged from 10.0 to 41.0 ng/g (average 27.0 ng/g). Imidacloprid was found in no investigated sample. No negative effects of neonicotinoid seed-treated maize on the development and long-term survival of honey bee colonies were observed. The low proportion of Zea mays pollen in total bee-collected pollen during the maize flowering period was noted. The findings suggest that maize plants are less attractive forage for honey bees than phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth.), buckwheat (Fagopyrum Mill.), white clover (Trifolium repens L.), goldenrod (Solidago L.), and vegetation from Brassicaceae family. The results indicate a possibility of reducing the risk of bees being exposed to the toxic effect of insecticidal dusts dispersed during maize sowing by seeding, in the areas surrounding maize crops, plants that bloom later in the year.			2013-12-01
Toxic effects of pesticides to humans and enviroment	The use of pesticides has been recognized and accepted as an essential ingredient in the modern agriculture for the control of pests. However, their irrational and unprotected uses are threatening our ecosystem, health and environment. The overuse of pesticides has already resulted in severe environmental deterioration, such as contamination in aquatic ecosystems and groundwater. In addition, pesticide residues in agricultural products can threaten human health through the food web. Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) persist in the environment for long periods of time, and biomagnify as they move up through the food chain. OCPs are harmful to both humans and the environment. Adverse health effects including reproductive failures, tumor induction, endocrine disruption and cancers can occur. A number of OC pesticides demonstrate weak estrogenic or antiestrogenic effects. It is believed that these compounds may act as a tumor promoter through hormone-mediated effects. Some epidemiologic studies have linked OC pesticides with several hormone-related cancers including breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Organochlorine pesticides have also been demonstrated to be neurotoxic, to cause oxidative stress, and to damage the dopaminergic system. The combination of their persistence in the environment and their potential to damage the dopamine system suggests that organochlorine pesticides may contribute to risk of PD. Exposures during pregnancy to unspecified residential pesticides insecticides, and herbicides were positively associated with childhood leukemia. Exposures during childhood to unspecified residential pesticides and insecticides were also positively associated with childhood leukemia, but there was no association with herbicides. © SGEM2013 All Rights Reserved by the International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference SGEM.

Towards the elements of successful insect RNAi	RNA interference (RNAi), the sequence-specific suppression of gene expression, offers great opportunities for insect science, especially to analyze gene function, manage pest populations, and reduce disease pathogens. The accumulating body of literature on insect RNAi has revealed that the efficiency of RNAi varies between different species, the mode of RNAi delivery, and the genes being targeted. There is also variation in the duration of transcript suppression. At present, we have a limited capacity to predict the ideal experimental strategy for RNAi of a particular gene/insect because of our incomplete understanding of whether and how the RNAi signal is amplified and spread among insect cells. Consequently, development of the optimal RNAi protocols is a highly empirical process. This limitation can be relieved by systematic analysis of the molecular physiological basis of RNAi mechanisms in insects. An enhanced conceptual understanding of RNAi function in insects will facilitate the application of RNAi for dissection of gene function, and to fast-track the application of RNAi to both control pests and develop effective methods to protect beneficial insects and non-insect arthropods, particularly the honey bee ( Apis mellifera) and cultured Pacific white shrimp ( Litopenaeus vannamei) from viral and parasitic diseases. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.		crustacean, disease treatment, gene expression, genetic analysis, honeybee, parasitic disease, pathogen, pest control, physiology, small interfering RNA, animal, antiviral therapy, dsRNA, genetics, insect, insect control, insect pest control, review, RNA interference, Systemic RNAi, Antiviral therapy, dsRNA, Insect pest control, RNA interference, siRNA, Systemic RNAi, Animals, Insect Control, Insects, RNA Interference	2013-12-01
Trace level determination of pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides in beebread using acetonitrile-based extraction followed by analysis with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry	To better understand this contamination, the study aimed to develop an efficient, sensitive and reliable analytical method for the trace analysis of pesticides in beebread. This study focuses specifically on the insecticides pyrethroids and neonicotinoids and some of their metabolites. It describes the development and validation of an original analytical approach that consists of one simple extraction method based on modified QuEChERS followed by a selective and sensitive analysis by UHPLC-MS/MS to determine the target compounds in beebread. The method was validated using a quadratic fit. RSD values below 20% were obtained, except for 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid and imidacloprid at 0.5. ng/g, which exhibited RSDs of 25% and 21%, respectively. The intra-day precision was less than 10% for many of the investigated compounds. The inter-day precision varied between 2% and 36%, depending on the compound and the concentration. The recoveries varied from 53% to 119%, with averages of 83, 81 and 77% for the extraction of beebread samples spiked at 0.5, 5 and 10. ng/g, respectively. The LOD values for all the substances were below ng/g, with the exception of 6-chloronicotinic acid (LOD. = 1.7. ng/g). The method was then applied to the analysis of 32 beebread samples and revealed the presence of 7 of the target substances. The most frequently detected pesticides belonged to the neonicotinoid family and were generally present at low concentrations, but in some cases exceeded 170. ng/g (acetamiprid and thiacloprid). Some pyrethroids were also detected (lambda-cyhalothrine and bifenthrine), but at very low levels. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Simultaneous determination of residues in pollen and high-fructose corn syrup from eight neonicotinoid insecticides by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry	The neonicotinoids have recently been identified as a potential contributing factor to the sudden decline in adult honeybee population, commonly known as colony collapse disorder (CCD). To protect the health of honeybees and other pollinators, a new, simple, and sensitive liquid chromatography- electrospray ionization mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of eight neonicotinoids, including acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, flonicamid, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam, in pollen and high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). In this method, eight neonicotinoids, along with their isotope-labeled internal standards, were extracted from 2 g of pollen or 5 g of HFCS using an optimized quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe extraction procedure. The method limits of detection in pollen and HFCS matrices were 0.03 ng/g for acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam and ranged between 0.03 and 0.1 ng/g for nitenpyram and flonicamid. The precision and accuracy were well within the acceptable 20 % range. Selectivity, linearity, lower limit of quantitation, matrix effect, recovery, and stability in autosampler were also evaluated during validation. This validated method has been used successfully in analyzing a set of pollen and HFCS samples collected for evaluating potential honeybee exposure to neonicotinoids. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Honey bee protein atlas at organ-level resolution	Genome sequencing has provided us with gene lists but cannot tell us where and how their encoded products work together to support life. Complex organisms rely on differential expression of subsets of genes/proteins in organs and tissues, and, in concert, evolved to their present state as they function together to improve an organism's overall reproductive fitness. Proteomics studies of individual organs help us understand their basic functions, but this reductionist approach misses the larger context of the whole organism. This problem could be circumvented if all the organs in an organism were comprehensively studied by the same methodology and analyzed together. Using honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) as a model system, we report here an initial whole proteome of a complex organism, measuring 29 different organ/ tissue types among the three honey bee castes: queen, drone, and worker. The data reveal that, e.g., workers have a heightened capacity to deal with environmental toxins and queens have a far more robust pheromone detection system than their nestmates. The data also suggest that workers altruistically sacrifice not only their own reproductive capacity but also their immune potential in favor of their queen. Finally, organ-level resolution of protein expression offers a systematic insight into how organs may have developed. © 2013 Bashford-Rogers et al.		honey bee protein, insect protein, pheromone, proteome, unclassified drug, animal experiment, animal tissue, Apis mellifera, article, controlled study, detoxification, female, gene sequence, genome, honeybee, metabolic capacity, nonhuman, organ, organ distribution, priority journal, protein expression, proteomics, quantitative analysis, tissues, worker, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Bees, Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Insect Proteins, Male, Molecular Sequence Data, Phenotype, Pheromones, Proteome, Proteomics, Social Behavior	2013-11-01
The development, validation and application of a GC-dual detector (NPD-ECD) multi-pesticide residue method for monitoring bee poisoning incidents	A simple multiresidue method based on matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD) combined with clean-up has been developed for the simultaneous screening of 153 pesticides in honeybees suspected of suffering from pesticide poisoning during field spraying. Extraction and clean-up were carried out in a glass column containing anhydrous sulphate, 2.0. g of octadecyl (C18) and a 2.0-g sample of bees (23 insects on average) macerated with 4.0. g of Florisil. An additional layer of anhydrous sodium sulphate was added, and acetonitrile was used as the elution solvent. This combination of clean-up steps ensured an efficient purification. A gas chromatograph with dual selective detectors for electron capture and nitrogen-phosphorous was used. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) with the one-step clean-up procedure is the most effective extraction technique. MSPD method recoveries ranged from 70 to 118%, with precision values expressed as a relative standard of <20%, except for 10 pesticides that had recoveries of 50-70% and two with 120-130%. Low limits of detection (0.003-0.04. μg/g) and quantification (0.005-0.05. μg/g) were readily achieved with this method for all tested pesticides. A "top down" empirical model was used to estimate the expanded uncertainty at 28% on average (coverage factor k=2, confidence level 95%). The MSPD method was successfully used on real bee samples to analyse four acaricides, 55 fungicides, 16 herbicides and 78 insecticides from various regions of Poland. A total of 33 honeybee samples from suspected pesticide poisoning incidents were analysed, in which 17 different pesticides were determined (14 insecticides and three fungicides). The pesticides most often found in honeybees were cypermethrin (in 51% of the samples, 0.008-0.563. μg/bee), chlorpyrifos (27%, 0.001-51.5. μg/bee) and biphentin (21%, 0.002-0.012. μg/bee). © 2013 Elsevier Inc.		acaricide, biphentin, chlorpyrifos, cipermethrin, fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, magnesium trisilicate, pesticide, unclassified drug, bee, detection method, fungicide, gas chromatography, insecticide, pesticide residue, poisoning, pollution effect, pollution exposure, accuracy, analytic method, article, calibration, chemical analysis, column chromatography, extraction, gas chromatography, honeybee, intoxication, matrix solid phase extraction, nonhuman, pesticide spraying, Poland, reliability, toxicity testing, Bees, Gas chromatography, Multiresidue method, Pesticide, Poisoning incidents, Animals, Bees, Chromatography, Gas, Environmental Monitoring, Pesticide Residues, Pesticides, Poland, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hexapoda	2013-11-01
Production of Solitary Bees for Pollination in the United States	Solitary bees are a diverse group of hymenopterans, in which all females are reproductive. These bees visit flowers to collect nectar and pollen to provision nests for their offspring. By visiting flowers, the bees transport pollen and promote pollination. Production of the bees is seasonal, and the oviposition rate is usually one or two per day. A few species are now under management to pollinate crops in the United States. These include Megachile rotundata for alfalfa seed and canola, Nomia melanderi for alfalfa seed, and Osmia lignaria for almonds, apples, and cherries. These bees must visit flowers and provision a nest prior to ovipositing, so production of these pollinators takes place in the field, greenhouse, or screenhouse. Populations can increase up to fivefold in a year. These bees are highly efficient pollinators, providing much needed diversity in agricultural pollination. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Influence of agrochemicals fipronil and imidacloprid on the learning behavior of Apis mellifera L. honeybees	Agrochemicals on crop cultivated areas is a source of contamination for bees and may cause physiological and behavioral disorders and mortality. The LD50 of the pesticides fipronil and imidacloprid was determined and their effect on the learning behavior of Apis mellifera L. honeybee evaluated. LD50 was determined by the ingestion of contaminated food with different concentrations of insecticide concentrations: Fipronil (0, 0.8, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 μg bee-1) and imidacloprid (0, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05 and 0.025 μg bee-1). The method of proboscis extension reflection (PER) and learning through citral odor evaluated their responses to food stimulation. LD50 obtained were 0.28 ± 0.11 and 0.10 ± 0.04 μg bee-1 for fipronil and imidacloprid, respectively. The PER test showed no significant difference (p < 0.05) although agrochemicals affected the learning of bees. Insecticides fipronil and imidacloprid are extremely harmful to foraging Africanized Apis mellifera bees.			2013-10-25
The Effect of Olfactory Exposure to Non-Insecticidal Agrochemicals on Bumblebee Foraging Behavior	Declines in bumblebee populations have led to investigations into potential causes - including agrochemical effects on bumblebee physiology. The indirect effects of agrochemicals (i.e. behavior modulation) have been postulated, but rarely directly tested. Olfactory information is critical in mediating bumblebee-floral interactions. As agrochemicals emit volatiles, they may indirectly modify foraging behavior. We tested the effects of olfactory contamination of floral odor by agrochemical scent on foraging activity of Bombus impatiens using two behavioral paradigms: localization of food within a maze and forced-choice preference. The presence of a fungicide decreased bumblebees' ability to locate food within a maze. Additionally, bumblebees preferred to forage in non-contaminated feeding chambers when offered a choice between control and either fertilizer- or fungicide-scented chambers. © 2013 Sprayberry et al.		agricultural chemical, fertilizer, animal behavior, article, bumblebee, controlled study, environmental exposure, food preference, foraging behavior, mass fragmentography, nonhuman, odor, olfactory discrimination, plant insect interaction, smelling, Agrochemicals, Animals, Bees, Choice Behavior, Environmental Exposure, Feeding Behavior, Flowers, Maze Learning, Odors, Olfactory Perception	2013-10-24
A Four-Year Field Program Investigating Long-Term Effects of Repeated Exposure of Honey Bee Colonies to Flowering Crops Treated with Thiamethoxam	Neonicotinoid residues in nectar and pollen from crop plants have been implicated as one of the potential factors causing the declines of honey bee populations. Median residues of thiamethoxam in pollen collected from honey bees after foraging on flowering seed treated maize were found to be between 1 and 7 μg/kg, median residues of the metabolite CGA322704 (clothianidin) in the pollen were between 1 and 4 μg/kg. In oilseed rape, median residues of thiamethoxam found in pollen collected from bees were between <1 and 3.5 μg/kg and in nectar from foraging bees were between 0.65 and 2.4 μg/kg. Median residues of CGA322704 in pollen and nectar in the oilseed rape trials were all below the limit of quantification (1 μg/kg). Residues in the hive were even lower in both the maize and oilseed rape trials, being at or below the level of detection of 1 μg/kg for bee bread in the hive and at or below the level of detection of 0.5 μg/kg for hive nectar, honey and royal jelly samples. The long-term risk to honey bee colonies in the field was also investigated, including the sensitive overwintering stage, from four years consecutive single treatment crop exposures to flowering maize and oilseed rape grown from thiamethoxam treated seeds at rates recommended for insect control. Throughout the study, mortality, foraging behavior, colony strength, colony weight, brood development and food storage levels were similar between treatment and control colonies. Detailed examination of brood development throughout the year demonstrated that colonies exposed to the treated crop were able to successfully overwinter and had a similar health status to the control colonies in the following spring. We conclude that these data demonstrate there is a low risk to honey bees from systemic residues in nectar and pollen following the use of thiamethoxam as a seed treatment on oilseed rape and maize. © 2013 Pilling et al.		clothianidin, insecticide, propolis, royal jelly, thiamethoxam, unclassified drug, ((E)-1-(2-chloro-1,3-thiazol-5-ylmethyl)-3-methyl-2-nitroguanidine), guanidine derivative, nectar, nitro derivative, oxazine derivative, thiamethoxam, thiazole derivative, animal experiment, article, barley, controlled study, crop, field study, food storage, foraging behavior, honey, honeybee, limit of quantitation, maize, nectar, nonhuman, organism colony, pollen, rapeseed, animal, bee, Brassica rapa, chemically induced, chemistry, colony collapse, drug effects, environmental exposure, France, statistics and numerical data, toxicity, Animals, Bees, Brassica rapa, Colony Collapse, Environmental Exposure, France, Guanidines, Nitro Compounds, Oxazines, Plant Nectar, Pollen, Thiazoles, Zea mays	2013-10-23
Effect of a Fungicide and Spray Adjuvant on Queen-Rearing Success in Honey Bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae)	Commercial producers of honey bee queens (Apis mellifera L.) have reported unexplained loss of immature queens during the larval or pupal stage. Many affected queen-rearing operations are situated among the almond orchards of California and report these losses in weeks after almond trees bloom. Almond flowers are a rich foraging resource for bees, but are often treated with fungicides, insecticides, and spray adjuvants during bloom. Anecdotal reports by queen producers associate problems in queen development with application of the fungicide Pristine (boscalid and pyraclostrobin) and spray adjuvants that are tank-mixed with it. To test the effect of these compounds on queen development, a new bioassay was developed in which queens are reared in closed swarm boxes for 4 d, until capping, with nurse bees fed exclusively on artificially contaminated pollen. Pollen was treated with four concentrations of formulated Pristine (0.4, 4,40, and 400 ppm), a spray adjuvant (Break-Thru, 200 ppm), the combination of Pristine and spray adjuvant (400:200 ppm), the insect growth regulator insecticide diflubenzuron (100 ppm) as a positive control, or water as negative control. Chemical analysis revealed that low concentrations of pyraclostrobin (50 ppb), but no boscalid, were detectable in royal jelly secreted by nurse bees feeding on treated pollen. No significant difference in queen development or survival was observed between any of the experimental treatments and the negative control. Only diflubenzuron, the positive control, caused a substantial reduction in survival of immature queens. © 2013 Entomological Society of America.		2 chloro N (4 chlorobiphenyl 2 yl)nicotinamide, 2-chloro-N-(4-chlorobiphenyl-2-yl)nicotinamide, biphenyl derivative, carbamic acid derivative, diflubenzuron, drug derivative, fungicide, insecticide, juvenile hormone, nicotinamide, organosilicon derivative, pharmaceutical vehicles and additives, pyrachlostrobin, pyrazole derivative, animal, article, bee, drug effect, female, growth, development and aging, larva, physiology, United States, Adjuvants, Pharmaceutic, Animals, Bees, Biphenyl Compounds, California, Carbamates, Diflubenzuron, Female, Fungicides, Industrial, Insecticides, Juvenile Hormones, Larva, Niacinamide, Organosilicon Compounds, Pyrazoles	2013-10-21
Field-Level Sublethal Effects of Approved Bee Hive Chemicals on Honey Bees (Apis mellifera L)	In a study replicated across two states and two years, we tested the sublethal effects on honey bees of the miticides Apistan (tau fluvalinate) and Check Mite+ (coumaphos) and the wood preservative copper naphthenate applied at label rates in field conditions. A continuous covariate, a colony Varroa mite index, helped us disambiguate the effects of the chemicals on bees while adjusting for a presumed benefit of controlling mites. Mite levels in colonies treated with Apistan or Check Mite+ were not different from levels in non-treated controls. Experimental chemicals significantly decreased 3-day brood survivorship and increased construction of queen supercedure cells compared to non-treated controls. Bees exposed to Check Mite+ as immatures had higher legacy mortality as adults relative to non-treated controls, whereas bees exposed to Apistan had improved legacy mortality relative to non-treated controls. Relative to non-treated controls, Check Mite+ increased adult emergence weight. Although there was a treatment effect on a test of associative learning, it was not possible to statistically separate the treatment means, but bees treated with Apistan performed comparatively well. And finally, there were no detected effects of bee hive chemical on colony bee population, amount of brood, amount of honey, foraging rate, time required for marked released bees to return to their nest, percentage of released bees that return to the nest, and colony Nosema spore loads. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine sublethal effects of bee hive chemicals applied at label rates under field conditions while disambiguating the results from mite control benefits realized from the chemicals. Given the poor performance of the miticides at reducing mites and their inconsistent effects on the host, these results defend the use of bee health management practices that minimize use of exotic hive chemicals. © 2013 Berry et al.		2,4 dimethylaniline, 2,4 dimethylphenylformamide, acaricide, amitraz, coumafos, naphthenate copper, propolis, tau fluvalinate, unclassified drug, wood protecting agent, Apis mellifera, article, conditioning, controlled study, foraging, fungus spore, honey, host, lethality, longevity, mortality, nesting, nonhuman, Nosema, state dependent learning, sublethal effect, survival, Varroa, weight, Acaricides, Animals, Bees, Insect Control, Varroidae	2013-10-18
Using a Hazard Quotient to Evaluate Pesticide Residues Detected in Pollen Trapped from Honey Bees (Apis mellifera) in Connecticut	Analysis of pollen trapped from honey bees as they return to their hives provides a method of monitoring fluctuations in one route of pesticide exposure over location and time. We collected pollen from apiaries in five locations in Connecticut, including urban, rural, and mixed agricultural sites, for periods from two to five years. Pollen was analyzed for pesticide residues using a standard extraction method widely used for pesticides (QuEChERS) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometric analysis. Sixty pesticides or metabolites were detected. Because the dose lethal to 50% of adult worker honey bees (LD50) is the only toxicity parameter available for a wide range of pesticides, and among our pesticides there were contact LD50 values ranging from 0.006 to >1000 μg per bee (range 166,000X), and even among insecticides LD50 values ranged from 0.006 to 59.8 μg/bee (10,000X); therefore we propose that in studies of honey bee exposure to pesticides that concentrations be reported as Hazard Quotients as well as in standard concentrations such as parts per billion. We used both contact and oral LD50 values to calculate Pollen Hazard Quotients (PHQ = concentration in ppb ÷ LD50 as μg/bee) when both were available. In this study, pesticide Pollen Hazard Quotients ranged from over 75,000 to 0.01. The pesticides with the greatest Pollen Hazard Quotients at the maximum concentrations found in our study were (in descending order): phosmet, Imidacloprid, indoxacarb, chlorpyrifos, fipronil, thiamethoxam, azinphos-methyl, and fenthion, all with at least one Pollen Hazard Quotient (using contact or oral LD50) over 500. At the maximum rate of pollen consumption by nurse bees, a Pollen Hazard Quotient of 500 would be approximately equivalent to consuming 0.5% of the LD50 per day. We also present an example of a Nectar Hazard Quotient and the percentage of LD50 per day at the maximum nectar consumption rate. © 2013 Stoner, Eitzer.		azinphos methyl, chlorpyrifos, fenthion, fipronil, imidacloprid, indoxacarb, phosmet, acute toxicity, Apis mellifera, article, biological monitoring, controlled study, ecotoxicity, environmental exposure, environmental impact, hazard ratio, LD 50, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, nonhuman, pesticide spraying, pollen, United States, Animals, Bees, Connecticut, Pesticide Residues, Pollen, Pollination	2013-10-15
Viral Infection Affects Sucrose Responsiveness and Homing Ability of Forager Honey Bees, Apis mellifera L	Honey bee health is mainly affected by Varroa destructor, viruses, Nosema spp., pesticide residues and poor nutrition. Interactions between these proposed factors may be responsible for the colony losses reported worldwide in recent years. In the present study, the effects of a honey bee virus, Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), on the foraging behaviors and homing ability of European honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) were investigated based on proboscis extension response (PER) assays and radio frequency identification (RFID) systems. The pollen forager honey bees originated from colonies that had no detectable level of honey bee viruses and were manually inoculated with IAPV to induce the viral infection. The results showed that IAPV-inoculated honey bees were more responsive to low sucrose solutions compared to that of non-infected foragers. After two days of infection, around 107 copies of IAPV were detected in the heads of these honey bees. The homing ability of IAPV-infected foragers was depressed significantly in comparison to the homing ability of uninfected foragers. The data provided evidence that IAPV infection in the heads may enable the virus to disorder foraging roles of honey bees and to interfere with brain functions that are responsible for learning, navigation, and orientation in the honey bees, thus, making honey bees have a lower response threshold to sucrose and lose their way back to the hive. © 2013 Li et al.		sucrose, animal behavior, Apis mellifera, article, foraging behavior, Israeli acute paralysis virus, Israeli acute paralysis virus infection, nonhuman, organism colony, survival rate, virus identification, virus infection, virus virulence, Animals, Bees, Dicistroviridae, Feeding Behavior, Homing Behavior, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Sucrose, Virus Diseases	2013-10-10
Non-Specific dsRNA-Mediated Antiviral Response in the Honey Bee	Honey bees are essential pollinators of numerous agricultural crops. Since 2006, honey bee populations have suffered considerable annual losses that are partially attributed to Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). CCD is an unexplained phenomenon that correlates with elevated incidence of pathogens, including RNA viruses. Honey bees are eusocial insects that live in colonies of genetically related individuals that work in concert to gather and store nutrients. Their social organization provides numerous benefits, but also facilitates pathogen transmission between individuals. To investigate honey bee antiviral defense mechanisms, we developed an RNA virus infection model and discovered that administration of dsRNA, regardless of sequence, reduced virus infection. Our results suggest that dsRNA, a viral pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP), triggers an antiviral response that controls virus infection in honey bees. © 2013 Flenniken, Andino.		antivirus agent, double stranded RNA, enhanced green fluorescent protein, animal experiment, animal model, antiviral activity, article, controlled study, defense mechanism, female, gene dosage, gene expression, gene function, genetic analysis, honeybee, immune response, immunoregulation, infection control, microarray analysis, nonhuman, nucleotide sequence, posttranscriptional gene silencing, protein expression, RNA interference, RNA sequence, RNA transcription, RNA virus infection, signal transduction, Sindbis virus, treatment response, virus immunity, Animals, Bees, Colony Collapse, Gene Expression Regulation, Gene Ontology, Immunity, RNA Viruses, RNA, Double-Stranded	2013-10-10
Circadian and seasonal changes in honeybee (Apis mellifera) worker susceptibility to diazinon, teflubenzuron, pirimicarb, and indoxacarb	Circadian and seasonal changes in the susceptibility of honeybee (Apis mellifera) workers to intoxication by organophosphate, benzoylphenyl urea, carbamate, and oxadiazine insecticides have been studied from 2008 to 2009. Animals were collected in two apiaries located in the surroundings of Mielec and Tarnobrzeg in the Sub-Carpathian Province. The experiments consisted of intoxication by select xenobiotics of the subsequent groups of animals in two-hour intervals for a period of 24 hours and the analysis of their survivability. Experiments were carried out in spring and summer. The results suggest that the susceptibility of bees to different groups of insecticides varies significantly, both in the circadian and seasonal rhythms.			2013-10-02
Imidacloprid does not induce Cyp genes involved in insecticide resistance of a mutant Drosophila melanogaster line	Certain xenobiotics have the capacity to induce the expression of genes involved in various biological phenomena, including insecticide resistance. The induction potential of different chemicals, among them different insecticides, has been documented for a number of insect species. In this study, we have analyzed the induction potential of Imidacloprid, a widely used member of the neonicotinoid insecticide family. Genes Cyp6g1 and Cyp6a2, known to be involved in the resistance of mutant Drosophila melanogaster line MiT[W-]3R2 to Imidacloprid and DDT were included in the analyzed sample.

Antifungal efficacy of some natural phenolic compounds against significant pathogenic and toxinogenic filamentous fungi	In terms of food safety, species of the Fusarium, Aspergillus and Penicillium genera are considered the most significant because they produce the great majority of known mycotoxins. Developing resistance against commonly used fungicides have become a critical problem in area such as agriculture, the storage and production of food and even in human medicines. The need for research and development of new alternative antifungal treatment based on natural antifungal substances is obvious. Here, the antifungal efficacy of 21 phenolic components of essential oils and plant substances were tested against these filamentous fungi with respect to their different molecular structures. Minimum inhibitory concentration values MIC50 and MIC100 were successfully estimated for 15 substances by means of probit analysis. Thymol and carvacrol were evaluated as the most effective. The MIC50 values for thymol ranged from 30 to 52μgmL-1. The MIC100 values for thymol ranged from 76 to 255μgmL-1, respectively. For carvacrol, the MIC50 values ranged from 37 to 76μgmL-1, and the MIC100 ranged from 131 to 262μgmL-1. The results also revealed differences in the efficacy of phenols depending on molecular structures and different inter-species sensitivity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Standard methods for research on Apis mellifera gut symbionts	Gut microbes can play an important role in digestion, disease resistance, and the general health of animals, but little is known about the biology of gut symbionts in Apis mellifera. As part of the BEEBOOK series describing honey bee research methods, we provide standard protocols for studying gut symbionts. We describe non-culture-based approaches based on Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), methodology that has greatly improved our ability to identify the microbial communities associated with honey bees. We also describe Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) microscopy, which allows a visual examination of the microenvironments where particular microbes occur. Culturing methods are also described, as they allow the researcher to isolate particular bacteria of interest for further study or gene identification, and enable the assignment of particular functions to particular gut community members. We hope these methods will help others advance the state of knowledge regarding bee gut symbionts and the role they play in honey bee health. © IBRA 2013.			2013-09-23
Standard use of Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques in honey bee research	Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have been used in various fields and disciplines to summarize and analyse spatial patterns and distributions, for the purpose of understanding how geographic and non-geographic entities interact with each other over space and time. Although honey bees are directly related to and influenced by their local environment, few studies have incorporated honey bee data into GIS for the purposes of gauging these spatial relationships. This paper will briefly discuss some of the types of spatial analyses and GIS methods that have been used for bees, and also, how some methodologies developed in the non-Apis bee domain could be applied to honey bee research. With this paper, we aim to stimulate spatial thinking processes and thus the future use of GIS analyses to better understand the relationships between environmental characteristics and honey bee health and abundance. We will introduce the framework and some important basic concepts of GIS, as well as provide detailed instructions for becoming familiar and comfortable in using the GIS softwares ArcGIS and Quantum GIS (QGIS) (a commercial and free GIS package) for the basics of geospatial research. © IBRA 2013.			2013-09-23
Standard epidemiological methods to understand and improve Apis mellifera health	In this paper, we describe the use of epidemiological methods to understand and reduce honey bee morbidity and mortality. Essential terms are presented and defined and we also give examples for their use. Defining such terms as disease, population, sensitivity, and specificity, provides a framework for epidemiological comparisons. The term population, in particular, is quite complex for an organism like the honey bee because one can view "epidemiological unit" as individual bees, colonies, apiaries, or operations. The population of interest must, therefore, be clearly defined. Equations and explanations of how to calculate measures of disease rates in a population are provided. There are two types of study design; observational and experimental. The advantages and limitations of both are discussed. Approaches to calculate and interpret results are detailed. Methods for calculating epidemiological measures such as detection of rare events, associating exposure and disease (Odds Ratio and Relative Risk), and comparing prevalence and incidence are discussed. Naturally, for beekeepers, the adoption of any management system must have economic advantage. We present a means to determine the cost and benefit of the treatment in order determine its net benefit. Lastly, this paper presents a discussion of the use of Hill's criteria for inferring causal relationships. This framework for judging cause-effect relationships supports a repeatable and quantitative evaluation process at the population or landscape level. Hill's criteria disaggregate the different kinds of evidence, allowing the scientist to consider each type of evidence individually and objectively, using a quantitative scoring method for drawing conclusions. It is hoped that the epidemiological approach will be more broadly used to study and negate honey bee disease. © IBRA 2013.			2013-09-23
Miscellaneous standard methods for Apis mellifera research	A variety of methods are used in honey bee research and differ depending on the level at which the research is conducted. On an individual level, the handling of individual honey bees, including the queen, larvae and pupae are required. There are different methods for the immobilising, killing and storing as well as determining individual weight of bees. The precise timing of developmental stages is also an important aspect of sampling individuals for experiments. In order to investigate and manipulate functional processes in honey bees, e.g. memory formation and retrieval and gene expression, microinjection is often used. A method that is used by both researchers and beekeepers is the marking of queens that serves not only to help to locate her during her life, but also enables the dating of queens. Creating multiple queen colonies allows the beekeeper to maintain spare queens, increase brood production or ask questions related to reproduction. On colony level, very useful techniques are the measurement of intra hive mortality using dead bee traps, weighing of full hives, collecting pollen and nectar, and digital monitoring of brood development via location recognition. At the population level, estimation of population density is essential to evaluate the health status and using beelines help to locate wild colonies. These methods, described in this paper, are especially valuable when investigating the effects of pesticide applications, environmental pollution and diseases on colony survival. © IBRA 2013.			2013-09-23
Standard methods for toxicology research in Apis mellifera	Modern agriculture often involves the use of pesticides to protect crops. These substances are harmful to target organisms (pests and pathogens). Nevertheless, they can also damage non-target animals, such as pollinators and entomophagous arthropods. It is obvious that the undesirable side effects of pesticides on the environment should be reduced to a minimum. Western honey bees (Apis mellifera) are very important organisms from an agricultural perspective and are vulnerable to pesticide-induced impacts. They contribute actively to the pollination of cultivated crops and wild vegetation, making food production possible. Of course, since Apis mellifera occupies the same ecological niche as many other species of pollinators, the loss of honey bees caused by environmental pollutants suggests that other insects may experience a similar outcome. Because pesticides can harm honey bees and other pollinators, it is important to register pesticides that are as selective as possible. In this manuscript, we describe a selection of methods used for studying pesticide toxicity/selectiveness towards Apis mellifera. These methods may be used in risk assessment schemes and in scientific research aimed to explain acute and chronic effects of any target compound on Apis mellifera. © IBRA 2013.			2013-09-23
Sequence Recombination and Conservation of Varroa destructor Virus-1 and Deformed Wing Virus in Field Collected Honey Bees (Apis mellifera)	We sequenced small (s) RNAs from field collected honeybees (Apis mellifera) and bumblebees (Bombus pascuorum) using the Illumina technology. The sRNA reads were assembled and resulting contigs were used to search for virus homologues in GenBank. Matches with Varroa destructor virus-1 (VDV1) and Deformed wing virus (DWV) genomic sequences were obtained for A. mellifera but not B. pascuorum. Further analyses suggested that the prevalent virus population was composed of VDV-1 and a chimera of 5'-DWV-VDV1-DWV-3'. The recombination junctions in the chimera genomes were confirmed by using RT-PCR, cDNA cloning and Sanger sequencing. We then focused on conserved short fragments (CSF, size > 25 nt) in the virus genomes by using GenBank sequences and the deep sequencing data obtained in this study. The majority of CSF sites confirmed conservation at both between-species (GenBank sequences) and within-population (dataset of this study) levels. However, conserved nucleotide positions in the GenBank sequences might be variable at the within-population level. High mutation rates (Pi>10%) were observed at a number of sites using the deep sequencing data, suggesting that sequence conservation might not always be maintained at the population level. Virus-host interactions and strategies for developing RNAi treatments against VDV1/DWV infections are discussed. © 2013 Wang et al.		complementary DNA, RNA, small RNA, unclassified drug, Apis mellifera, article, Bombus pascuorum, bumblebee, conserved short fragment, contig mapping, controlled study, deformed wing virus, female, gene structure, genetic analysis, genetic conservation, genetic recombination, genetic variability, genome size, honeybee, insect virus, molecular cloning, mutation rate, nonhuman, nucleotide sequence, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RNA interference, RNA sequence, Sanger sequencing, sequence homology, species difference, Varroa destructor virus 1, virus cell interaction, virus genome, virus infection, Animals, Base Sequence, Bees, Chimera, Conserved Sequence, Genome, Viral, Insect Viruses, Recombination, Genetic, Reproducibility of Results, RNA, Small Interfering, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Varroidae, Wing	2013-09-18
Exposure to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors alters the physiology and motor function of honeybees	Cholinergic signaling is fundamental to neuromuscular function in most organisms. Sub-lethal doses of neurotoxic pesticides that target cholinergic signaling can alter the behavior of insects in subtle ways; their influence on non-target organisms may not be readily apparent in simple mortality studies. Beneficial arthropods such as honeybees perform sophisticated behavioral sequences during foraging that, if influenced by pesticides, could impair foraging success and reduce colony health. Here, we investigate the behavioral effects on honeybees of exposure to a selection of pesticides that target cholinergic signaling by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE). To examine how continued exposure to AChE inhibitors affected motor function, we fed adult foraging worker honeybees sub-lethal concentrations of these compounds in sucrose solution for 24 h. Using an assay for locomotion in bees, we scored walking, stopped, grooming, and upside down behavior continuously for 15 min. At a 10 nM concentration, all the AChE inhibitors caused similar effects on behavior, notably increased grooming activity and changes in the frequency of bouts of behavior such as head grooming. Coumaphos caused dose-dependent effects on locomotion as well as grooming behavior, and a 1 μM concentration of coumaphos induced symptoms of malaise such as abdomen grooming and defecation. Biochemical assays confirmed that the four compounds we assayed (coumaphos, aldicarb, chlorpyrifos, and donepezil) or their metabolites acted as AChE inhibitors in bees. Furthermore, we show that transcript expression levels of two honeybee AChE inhibitors were selectively upregulated in the brain and in gut tissues in response to AChE inhibitor exposure. The results of our study imply that the effects of pesticides that rely on this mode of action have subtle yet profound effects on physiological effects on behavior that could lead to reduced survival. © 2013 Williamson, Moffat, Gomersall, Saranzewa, Connolly and Wright.		acetylcholinesterase, aldicarb, chlorpyrifos, cholinesterase inhibitor, coumafos, donepezil, pesticide, animal experiment, animal tissue, article, brain, cholinergic system, concentration response, controlled study, defecation, genetic transcription, grooming, honeybee, intestine, malaise, motor performance, muscle spasm, nonhuman, nucleotide sequence, righting reflex, seasonal variation, upregulation, worker (insect)	2013-09-17
Comparative Toxicities and Synergism of Apple Orchard Pesticides to Apis mellifera (L.) and Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski)	The topical toxicities of five commercial grade pesticides commonly sprayed in apple orchards were estimated on adult worker honey bees, Apis mellifera (L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and Japanese orchard bees, Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae). The pesticides were acetamiprid (Assail 30SG), λ-cyhalothrin (Warrior II), dimethoate (Dimethoate 4EC), phosmet (Imidan 70W), and imidacloprid (Provado 1.6F). At least 5 doses of each chemical, diluted in distilled water, were applied to freshly-eclosed adult bees. Mortality was assessed after 48 hr. Dose-mortality regressions were analyzed by probit analysis to test the hypotheses of parallelism and equality by likelihood ratio tests. For A. mellifera, the decreasing order of toxicity at LD50 was imidacloprid, λ-cyhalothrin, dimethoate, phosmet, and acetamiprid. For O. cornifrons, the decreasing order of toxicity at LD50 was dimethoate, λ-cyhalothrin, imidacloprid, acetamiprid, and phosmet. Interaction of imidacloprid or acetamiprid with the fungicide fenbuconazole (Indar 2F) was also tested in a 1:1 proportion for each species. Estimates of response parameters for each mixture component applied to each species were compared with dose-response data for each mixture in statistical tests of the hypothesis of independent joint action. For each mixture, the interaction of fenbuconazole (a material non-toxic to both species) was significant and positive along the entire line for the pesticide. Our results clearly show that responses of A. mellifera cannot be extrapolated to responses of O.cornifrons, and that synergism of neonicotinoid insecticides and fungicides occurs using formulated product in mixtures as they are commonly applied in apple orchards. © 2013 Biddinger et al.		acetamiprid, cyhalothrin, dimethoate, fenbuconazole, fungicide, imidacloprid, insecticide, neonicotinoid, pesticide, phosmet, propiconazole, thiacloprid, triflumizole, unclassified drug, adult animal, animal experiment, Apis mellifera, article, bee, controlled study, LD 50, mortality, nonhuman, Osmia cornifrons, sensitivity analysis, species comparison, species diversity, Animals, Bees, Dimethoate, Drug Synergism, Fungicides, Industrial, Imidazoles, Insecticides, Lethal Dose 50, Malus, Nitriles, Nitro Compounds, Phosmet, Pyrethrins, Pyridines, Triazoles	2013-09-09
In Vitro Infection of Pupae with Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus Suggests Disturbance of Transcriptional Homeostasis in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera)	The ongoing decline of honey bee health worldwide is a serious economic and ecological concern. One major contributor to the decline are pathogens, including several honey bee viruses. However, information is limited on the biology of bee viruses and molecular interactions with their hosts. An experimental protocol to test these systems was developed, using injections of Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) into honey bee pupae reared ex-situ under laboratory conditions. The infected pupae developed pronounced but variable patterns of disease. Symptoms varied from complete cessation of development with no visual evidence of disease to rapid darkening of a part or the entire body. Considerable differences in IAPV titer dynamics were observed, suggesting significant variation in resistance to IAPV among and possibly within honey bee colonies. Thus, selective breeding for virus resistance should be possible. Gene expression analyses of three separate experiments suggest IAPV disruption of transcriptional homeostasis of several fundamental cellular functions, including an up-regulation of the ribosomal biogenesis pathway. These results provide first insights into the mechanisms of IAPV pathogenicity.

Biphasic responses of the honeybee heart to nanomolar concentrations of amitraz	Amitraz is a pesticide targeting the octopaminergic receptors. In a previous study, octopamine, a biogenic amine, was found to induce a biphasic effect on the honeybee heart, inhibition at low concentrations and excitation at high concentrations. Furthermore, the honeybee heart was found to be far more sensitive to octopamine compared to other insect hearts. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of amitraz on the electrical and mechanical properties of the honeybee heart ex vivo and on the heart rate in vivo. In ex vivo conditions, amitraz at 10-12M caused a significant inhibition in the mechanical (p<0.05, n=4) and electrical properties (p<0.05, n=4). Higher concentrations such as 10-9 and 10-6M induced a biphasic effect, with total inhibition for 7.86±1.26min (n=7), followed by strong excitation of spontaneously-generated contractions (n=7). The initial elimination of heart activity was caused by strong hyperpolarization, while the subsequent excitation was caused by a depolarization in the membrane potential of pacemaker cells at 10-9M (n=8). In the in vivo experiments, abdominal injection or oral application of 0.20ng of amitraz per bee induced a persistent increase of 134.28±4.07% (p<0.05, n=4) in the frequency of the cardiac action potentials. The above responses clearly show that the heart of the honeybee is extremely vulnerable to amitraz, which is nevertheless still used inside beehives, ostensibly to "protect" the honeybees against their main parasite, Varroa destructor. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Sub-lethal effects of thiamethoxam, a neonicotinoid pesticide, and propiconazole, a DMI fungicide, on colony initiation in bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) micro-colonies	This study investigated whether field-realistic exposure to a neonicotinoid insecticide and a fungicide affected nest building or brood production in queenless Bombus terrestris micro-colonies in the laboratory. Bees were exposed to honey water and pollen paste containing field-realistic mean or field-maximum exposure rates of thiamethoxam (1, 10 μg/kg) or propiconazole (23, 230 mg/kg) for 28 days. Thiamethoxam: Both doses reduced consumption of honey water solution and resulted in fewer wax cells. At 10 μg/kg, nest building initiation was delayed, fewer eggs were laid and no larvae produced. Propiconazole: Both doses reduced consumption of honey water solution. At 23 mg/kg, fewer wax cells were produced. Thus, at realistic (mean) exposure rates of these pesticides, no adverse impacts on brood production were found. Pesticide-free alternative forage will reduce field exposure by dilution and thus the impact of maximum rates. © 2013 INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		bee, colony structure, dilution, foraging behavior, fungicide, honey, nestedness, pesticide, pollen	2013-09-01
Seasonal prevalence of pathogens and parasites in the savannah honeybee (Apis mellifera scutellata)	The loss of Apis mellifera L. colonies in recent years has, in many regions of the world, been alarmingly high. No single cause has been identified for these losses, but the interactions between several factors (mostly pathogens and parasites) have been held responsible. Work in the Americas on honeybees originating mainly from South Africa indicates that Africanised honeybees are less affected by the interplay of pathogens and parasites. However, little is known about the health status of South African honeybees (A. m. scutellata and A. m. capensis) in relation to pathogens and parasites. We therefore compared the seasonal prevalence of honeybee pathogens (viruses, bacteria, fungi) and parasites (mites, bee lice, wax moth, small hive beetles, A. m. capensis social parasites) between sedentary and migratory A. m. scutellata apiaries situated in the Gauteng region of South Africa. No significant differences were found in the prevalence of pathogens and parasites between sedentary and migratory apiaries. Three (Black queen cell virus, Varroa destructor virus 1 and Israeli acute paralysis virus) of the eight viruses screened were detected, a remarkable difference compared to European honeybees. Even though no bacterial pathogens were detected, Nosema apis and Chalkbrood were confirmed. All of the honeybee parasites were found in the majority of the apiaries with the most common parasite being the Varroa mite. In spite of hosting few pathogens, yet most parasites, A. m. scutellata colonies appeared to be healthy. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.		animal, Apis mellifera scutellata, article, bee, comparative study, genetics, honeybee, isolation and purification, microbiology, Nosema, parasite, parasitology, pathogenesis, prevalence, season, South Africa, Varroa destructor, Varroidae, virology, virus, Apis mellifera scutellata, Honeybee, Parasite, Pathogen, Varroa destructor, Virus, Animals, Bees, Nosema, Prevalence, Seasons, South Africa, Varroidae	2013-09-01
Neonicotinoids, bee disorders and the sustainability of pollinator services	In less than 20 years, neonicotinoids have become the most widely used class of insecticides with a global market share of more than 25%. For pollinators, this has transformed the agrochemical landscape. These chemicals mimic the acetylcholine neurotransmitter and are highly neurotoxic to insects. Their systemic mode of action inside plants means phloemic and xylemic transport that results in translocation to pollen and nectar. Their wide application, persistence in soil and water and potential for uptake by succeeding crops and wild plants make neonicotinoids bioavailable to pollinators at sublethal concentrations for most of the year. This results in the frequent presence of neonicotinoids in honeybee hives. At field realistic doses, neonicotinoids cause a wide range of adverse sublethal effects in honeybee and bumblebee colonies, affecting colony performance through impairment of foraging success, brood and larval development, memory and learning, damage to the central nervous system, susceptibility to diseases, hive hygiene etc. Neonicotinoids exhibit a toxicity that can be amplified by various other agrochemicals and they synergistically reinforce infectious agents such as Nosema ceranae which together can produce colony collapse. The limited available data suggest that they are likely to exhibit similar toxicity to virtually all other wild insect pollinators. The worldwide production of neonicotinoids is still increasing. Therefore a transition to pollinator-friendly alternatives to neonicotinoids is urgently needed for the sake of the sustainability of pollinator ecosystem services. © 2013 The Authors.		agrochemical, damage, honeybee, insecticide, landscape, larval development, learning, memory, nervous system, pollinator, sustainability, toxicity, translocation, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hexapoda, Nosema, Nosema ceranae	2013-09-01
Comprehensive Bee Pathogen Screening in Belgium Reveals Crithidia mellificae as a New Contributory Factor to Winter Mortality	Since the last decade, unusually high honey bee colony losses have been reported mainly in North-America and Europe. Here, we report on a comprehensive bee pathogen screening in Belgium covering 363 bee colonies that were screened for 18 known disease-causing pathogens and correlate their incidence in summer with subsequent winter mortality. Our analyses demonstrate that, in addition to Varroa destructor, the presence of the trypanosomatid parasite Crithidia mellificae and the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae in summer are also predictive markers of winter mortality, with a negative synergy being observed between the two in terms of their effects on colony mortality. Furthermore, we document the first occurrence of a parasitizing phorid fly in Europe, identify a new fourth strain of Lake Sinai Virus (LSV), and confirm the presence of other little reported pathogens such as Apicystis bombi, Aphid Lethal Paralysis Virus (ALPV), Spiroplasma apis, Spiroplasma melliferum and Varroa destructor Macula-like Virus (VdMLV). Finally, we provide evidence that ALPV and VdMLV replicate in honey bees and show that viruses of the LSV complex and Black Queen Cell Virus tend to non-randomly co-occur together. We also noticed a significant correlation between the number of pathogen species and colony losses. Overall, our results contribute significantly to our understanding of honey bee diseases and the likely causes of their current decline in Europe. © 2013 Ravoet et al.

Quantitative determination of trisiloxane surfactants in beehive environments based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry	Organosilicone surfactants are increasingly being applied to agricultural agro-ecosystems as spray adjuvants, and were recently shown to impact the learning ability of honey bees. Here we developed a method for analyzing three trisiloxane surfactants (single polyethoxylate (EO) chain and end-capped with methyl, acetyl, or hydroxyl groups; TSS-CH3, TSS-COCH3, or TSS-H) in beehive matrices based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and the QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) approach from less than 2 g of honey, pollen, or beeswax. Recoveries for each oligomer (2-13 EO) were between 66 and 112% in all matrices. Average method detection limits (MDL) were 0.53, 0.60, 0.56 ng/g in honey, 0.63, 0.81, 0.78 ng/g in pollen, and 0.51, 0.69, 0.63 ng/g in beeswax. Five honey, 10 pollen, and 10 beeswax samples were analyzed. Trisiloxane surfactants were detected in every beeswax and 60% of the pollen samples. Total trisiloxane surfactant concentrations were up to 390 and 39 ng/g in wax and pollen. The described method is proved suitable for analyzing trisiloxane surfactants in beehive samples. The presence of trisiloxane surfactants in North American beehives calls for renewed effort to investigate the consequence of these adjuvants to bee health and the ongoing global bee decline. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

Influence of Pollen Nutrition on Honey Bee Health: Do Pollen Quality and Diversity Matter?	Honey bee colonies are highly dependent upon the availability of floral resources from which they get the nutrients (notably pollen) necessary to their development and survival. However, foraging areas are currently affected by the intensification of agriculture and landscape alteration. Bees are therefore confronted to disparities in time and space of floral resource abundance, type and diversity, which might provide inadequate nutrition and endanger colonies. The beneficial influence of pollen availability on bee health is well-established but whether quality and diversity of pollen diets can modify bee health remains largely unknown. We therefore tested the influence of pollen diet quality (different monofloral pollens) and diversity (polyfloral pollen diet) on the physiology of young nurse bees, which have a distinct nutritional physiology (e.g. hypopharyngeal gland development and vitellogenin level), and on the tolerance to the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae by measuring bee survival and the activity of different enzymes potentially involved in bee health and defense response (glutathione-S-transferase (detoxification), phenoloxidase (immunity) and alkaline phosphatase (metabolism)). We found that both nurse bee physiology and the tolerance to the parasite were affected by pollen quality. Pollen diet diversity had no effect on the nurse bee physiology and the survival of healthy bees. However, when parasitized, bees fed with the polyfloral blend lived longer than bees fed with monofloral pollens, excepted for the protein-richest monofloral pollen. Furthermore, the survival was positively correlated to alkaline phosphatase activity in healthy bees and to phenoloxydase activities in infected bees. Our results support the idea that both the quality and diversity (in a specific context) of pollen can shape bee physiology and might help to better understand the influence of agriculture and land-use intensification on bee nutrition and health. © 2013 Di Pasquale et al.		alkaline phosphatase, arginine, glutathione transferase, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, monophenol monooxygenase, phenylalanine, threonine, transferrin, tryptophan, valine, vitellogenin, animal food, animal health, Apis mellifera, article, bee, biodiversity, comparative study, controlled study, detoxification, enzyme activity, food composition, food quality, gene expression, hypopharynx, immunity, nonhuman, Nosema, Nosema ceranae, nurse bee, nutritional value, organogenesis, parasite tolerance, physical tolerance, physiology, plant parameters, pollen nutrition, protein content, survival rate, transferrin gene, vitellogenin gene, Animal Feed, Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena, Animals, Bees, Pollen, Survival	2013-08-05
Effects of fluvalinate on honey bee learning, memory, responsiveness to sucrose, and survival	Contaminants can affect organisms' behaviour and, as a consequence, survival. Tau-fluvalinate (hereafter fluvalinate) is the active ingredient in a pesticide commonly used in North America to control Varroa destructor mites in honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies. Fluvalinate's effects on honey bees are not well known. Honey bee cognitive and neural function can be assessed using the proboscis extension reflex (PER), which applies Pavlovian conditioning techniques. This study used PER to evaluate effects of fluvalinate on honey bee acquisition learning, (long-term) memory recall, responsiveness to sucrose, and mortality. We also evaluated how exclusion criteria for honey bees that did not exhibit PER during training and memory trials affected interpretation of results. Fluvalinate was administered both orally and dermally at high and low doses to mimic routes by which honey bees are exposed. We found negative effects of fluvalinate on honey bee learning, memory, responsiveness to sucrose, and survival, especially in high oral doses. We also found significant consequences to interpretation of results using different exclusion criteria. For example, almost 50% of individuals that failed to show evidence of learning subsequently showed evidence of memory. The latter results have important implications regarding traditional assessment of PER-based learning and memory; the former results suggest that evaluation of honey bee exposure to fluvalinate and attendant consequences warrants further investigation. © 2013.

A rapid survey technique for tropilaelaps mite (Mesostigmata: Laelapidae) detection	Parasitic Tropilaelaps (Delfinado and Baker) mites are a damaging pest of European honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) in Asia. These mites represent a significant threat if introduced to other regions of the world, warranting implementation of Tropilaelaps mite surveillance in uninfested regions. Current Tropilaelaps mite-detection methods are unsuitable for efficient large scale screening. We developed and tested a new bump technique that consists of firmly rapping a honey bee brood frame over a collecting pan. Our method was easier to implement than current detection tests, reduced time spent in each apiary, and minimized brood destruction. This feasibility increase overcomes the test's decreased rate of detecting infested colonies (sensitivity; 36.3% for the bump test, 54.2% and 56.7% for the two most sensitive methods currently used in Asia). Considering this sensitivity, we suggest that screening programs sample seven colonies per apiary (independent of apiary size) and 312 randomly selected apiaries in a region to be 95% sure of detecting an incipient Tropilaelaps mite invasion. Further analyses counter the currently held view that Tropilaelaps mites prefer drone bee brood cells. Tropilaelaps mite infestation rate was 3.5 ± 0.9% in drone brood and 5.7 ± 0.6% in worker brood. We propose the bump test as a standard tool for monitoring of Tropilaelaps mite presence in regions thought to be free from infestation. However, regulators may favor the sensitivity of the Drop test (collecting mites that fall to the bottom of a hive on sticky boards) over the less time-intensive Bump test.

Towards a systems approach for understanding honeybee decline: A stocktaking and synthesis of existing models	The health of managed and wild honeybee colonies appears to have declined substantially in Europe and the United States over the last decade. Sustainability of honeybee colonies is important not only for honey production, but also for pollination of crops and wild plants alongside other insect pollinators. A combination of causal factors, including parasites, pathogens, land use changes and pesticide usage, are cited as responsible for the increased colony mortality. However, despite detailed knowledge of the behaviour of honeybees and their colonies, there are no suitable tools to explore the resilience mechanisms of this complex system under stress. Empirically testing all combinations of stressors in a systematic fashion is not feasible. We therefore suggest a cross-level systems approach, based on mechanistic modelling, to investigate the impacts of (and interactions between) colony and land management. We review existing honeybee models that are relevant to examining the effects of different stressors on colony growth and survival. Most of these models describe honeybee colony dynamics, foraging behaviour or honeybee - varroa mite - virus interactions. We found that many, but not all, processes within honeybee colonies, epidemiology and foraging are well understood and described in the models, but there is no model that couples in-hive dynamics and pathology with foraging dynamics in realistic landscapes. Synthesis and applications. We describe how a new integrated model could be built to simulate multifactorial impacts on the honeybee colony system, using building blocks from the reviewed models. The development of such a tool would not only highlight empirical research priorities but also provide an important forecasting tool for policy makers and beekeepers, and we list examples of relevant applications to bee disease and landscape management decisions.

Crop Pollination Exposes Honey Bees to Pesticides Which Alters Their Susceptibility to the Gut Pathogen Nosema ceranae	Recent declines in honey bee populations and increasing demand for insect-pollinated crops raise concerns about pollinator shortages. Pesticide exposure and pathogens may interact to have strong negative effects on managed honey bee colonies. Such findings are of great concern given the large numbers and high levels of pesticides found in honey bee colonies. Thus it is crucial to determine how field-relevant combinations and loads of pesticides affect bee health. We collected pollen from bee hives in seven major crops to determine 1) what types of pesticides bees are exposed to when rented for pollination of various crops and 2) how field-relevant pesticide blends affect bees' susceptibility to the gut parasite Nosema ceranae. Our samples represent pollen collected by foragers for use by the colony, and do not necessarily indicate foragers' roles as pollinators. In blueberry, cranberry, cucumber, pumpkin and watermelon bees collected pollen almost exclusively from weeds and wildflowers during our sampling. Thus more attention must be paid to how honey bees are exposed to pesticides outside of the field in which they are placed. We detected 35 different pesticides in the sampled pollen, and found high fungicide loads. The insecticides esfenvalerate and phosmet were at a concentration higher than their median lethal dose in at least one pollen sample. While fungicides are typically seen as fairly safe for honey bees, we found an increased probability of Nosema infection in bees that consumed pollen with a higher fungicide load. Our results highlight a need for research on sub-lethal effects of fungicides and other chemicals that bees placed in an agricultural setting are exposed to.		carbamic acid derivative, cyclodiene derivative, fenvalerate, formamidine, fungicide, insecticide, neonicotinoid derivative, organophosphate, oxadiazine derivative, pesticide, phosmet, pyrethroid, unclassified drug, animal health, Apis mellifera, article, concentration (parameters), controlled study, disease predisposition, endoparasite, environmental exposure, fungicide application, high risk population, infection risk, nonhuman, Nosema ceranae, nosemosis, organism colony, plant insect interaction, pollen, pollen analysis, pollination, risk assessment	2013-07-24
Scientific note on side effectsof oxalic acid on the worker bee (Apis mellifera): Biochemical aspect)	Oxalic acid is considered as widely used method for treatment against varroa destructor mite,this mite causes a considerabledisorder to honeybees comparing with other bee diseases. Where as the usage of Oxalic acid may causes a weakening of bee coloniesas a side effect. This study aims to determine the effects of oxalic acid on thebiochemical aspect of the honeybee Apis mellifera,bystudying the variations in the content of differentmetabolites of the body and hemolymph (proteins, lipids and carbohydrates). Treatment with oxalic acid disrupts the metabolism of the bee, the results show that it causes a drop in carbohydrate and fat and increased protein levels in the body and the hemolymph. These findings may explain cases of weakness reported by beekeepers afterapplication of this treatment.			2013-07-18
Multifaceted responses to two major parasites in the honey bee (Apis mellifera)	The recent declines in managed honey bee populations are of scientific, ecological and economic concern, and are partially attributed to honey bee parasites and related disease. McDonnell et al. investigate behavioral, chemical and neurogenomic effects of parasitization by the ectoparasite Varroa destructor and the endoparasite Nosema ceranae. The study reveals important links between underlying mechanisms of immunity and parasitization in social insects by demonstrating that chemical signals and neurogenomic states are significantly different between parasitized and non-parasitized honey bees, and that neurogenomic states are partially conserved between bees infected with distinct parasites. However the study does not reveal whether differences measured are primarily the result of adaptive host responses or of manipulation of the honey bee host by the parasites and/or confounding viral loads of parasitized individuals. Questions answered and raised by McDonnell et al. will lead to an improved understanding of honey bee health and, more generally, host-parasite interactions. © 2013 Wagoner et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Ecto- and endoparasite induce similar chemical and brain neurogenomic responses in the honey bee (Apis mellifera)	Background: Exclusion from a social group is an effective way to avoid parasite transmission. This type of social removal has also been proposed as a form of collective defense, or social immunity, in eusocial insect groups. If parasitic modification of host behavior is widespread in social insects, the underlying physiological and neuronal mechanisms remain to be investigated. We studied this phenomenon in honey bees parasitized by the mite Varroa destructor or microsporidia Nosema ceranae, which make bees leave the hive precociously. We characterized the chemical, behavioral and neurogenomic changes in parasitized bees, and compared the effects of both parasites.Results: Analysis of cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS) showed changes in honey bees parasitized by either Nosema ceranae or Varroa destructor after 5 days of infestation. Levels of 10-HDA, an antiseptic important for social immunity, did not change in response to parasitism. Behavioral analysis of N. ceranae- or V. destructor- parasitized bees revealed no significant differences in their behavioral acts or social interactions with nestmates. Digital gene expression (DGE) analysis of parasitized honey bee brains demonstrated that, despite the difference in developmental stage at which the bee is parasitized, Nosema and Varroa-infested bees shared more gene changes with each other than with honey bee brain expression gene sets for forager or nurse castes.Conclusions: Parasitism by Nosema or Varroa induces changes to both the CHC profiles on the surface of the bee and transcriptomic profiles in the brain, but within the social context of the hive, does not result in observable effects on her behavior or behavior towards her. While parasitized bees are reported to leave the hive as foragers, their brain transcription profiles suggest that their behavior is not driven by the same molecular pathways that induce foraging behavior. © 2013 McDonnell et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.		endoparasite, foraging behavior, gas chromatography, honeybee, immunity, mass spectrometry, physiology, social exclusion, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hexapoda, Microsporidia, Nosema, Nosema ceranae, Varroa, Varroa destructor, hydrocarbon, transcriptome, animal, article, bee, brain, chemistry, host parasite interaction, metabolism, mite, Nosema, parasitology, physiology, social behavior, Animals, Bees, Brain, Host-Parasite Interactions, Hydrocarbons, Mites, Nosema, Social Behavior, Transcriptome	2013-07-17
Single and mixed-species trypanosome and microsporidia infections elicit distinct, ephemeral cellular and humoral immune responses in honey bees	Frequently encountered parasite species impart strong selective pressures on host immune system evolution and are more apt to concurrently infect the same host, yet molecular impacts in light of this are often overlooked. We have contrasted immune responses in honey bees to two common eukaryotic endoparasites by establishing single and mixed-species infections using the long-associated parasite Crithidia mellificae and the emergent parasite Nosema ceranae. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to screen host immune gene expression at 9 time points post inoculation. Systemic responses in abdomens during early stages of parasite establishment revealed conserved receptor (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule, Dscam and nimrod C1, nimC1), signaling (MyD88 and Imd) and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) effector (Defensin 2) responses. Late, established infections were distinct with a refined 2 AMP response to C. mellificae that contrasted starkly with a 5 AMP response to N. ceranae. Mixed species infections induced a moderate 3 AMPs. Transcription in gut tissues highlighted important local roles for Dscam toward both parasites and Imd signaling toward N. ceranae. At both systemic and local levels Dscam, MyD88 and Imd transcription was consistently correlated based on clustering analysis. Significant gene suppression occurred in two cases from midgut to ileum tissue: Dscam was lowered during mixed infections compared to N. ceranae infections and both C. mellificae and mixed infections had reduced nimC1 transcription compared to uninfected controls. We show that honey bees rapidly mount complex immune responses to both Nosema and Crithidia that are dynamic over time and that mixed-species infections significantly alter local and systemic immune gene transcription. © 2013.		beta defensin 2, cell adhesion molecule, Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule, Imd protein, myeloid differentiation factor 88, nimC1 protein, unclassified drug, abdomen, animal experiment, animal tissue, article, cellular immunity, cluster analysis, controlled study, correlation analysis, Crithidia mellificae, gene expression, gene repression, genetic transcription, honeybee, humoral immunity, ileum, immune response, microsporidiosis, midgut, mixed infection, nonhuman, Nosema ceranae, polymerase chain reaction, priority journal, trypanosomiasis, Animals, Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides, Bees, Cell Adhesion Molecules, Cluster Analysis, Crithidia, Defensins, Gastrointestinal Tract, Gene Expression Regulation, Host-Parasite Interactions, Immunity, Humoral, Insect Proteins, Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88, Nosema, Signal Transduction, Transcriptome	2013-07-01
Accelerated evolution of innate immunity proteins in social insects: Adaptive evolution or relaxed constraint?	The genomes of eusocial insects have a reduced complement of immune genes - an unusual finding considering that sociality provides ideal conditions for disease transmission. The following three hypotheses have been invoked to explain this finding: 1) social insects are attacked by fewer pathogens, 2) social insects have effective behavioral or 3) novel molecular mechanisms for combating pathogens. At the molecular level, these hypotheses predict that canonical innate immune pathways experience a relaxation of selective constraint. A recent study of several innate immune genes in ants and bees showed a pattern of accelerated amino acid evolution, which is consistent with either positive selection or a relaxation of constraint. We studied the population genetics of innate immune genes in the honey bee Apis mellifera by partially sequencing 13 genes from the bee's Toll pathway (∼10.5 kb) and 20 randomly chosen genes (∼16.5 kb) sequenced in 43 diploid workers. Relative to the random gene set, Toll pathway genes had significantly higher levels of amino acid replacement mutations segregating within A. mellifera and fixed between A. mellifera and A. cerana. However, levels of diversity and divergence at synonymous sites did not differ between the two gene sets. Although we detect strong signs of balancing selection on the pathogen recognition gene pgrp-sa, many of the genes in the Toll pathway show signatures of relaxed selective constraint. These results are consistent with the reduced complement of innate immune genes found in social insects and support the hypothesis that some aspect of eusociality renders canonical innate immunity superfluous. © 2013 The Author.		nucleotide, Pathogen Recognition Receptor, receptor, unclassified drug, ant, Apis cerana, Apis mellifera, article, concentration (parameters), diploidy, gene, gene mutation, genetic analysis, genetic selection, genetic variability, honeybee, immunogenetics, innate immunity, molecular evolution, nonhuman, nucleotide sequence, pgrp sa gene, population genetics, protein structure, sequence analysis, Apis mellifera, balancing selection, innate immunity, positive selection, relaxed constraint, Animals, Base Sequence, Bees, Evolution, Molecular, Immunity, Innate, Insects, Metabolic Networks and Pathways, Phylogeny, Proteins, Social Behavior, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Formicidae, Hexapoda	2013-07-01
Widespread Occurrence of Chemical Residues in Beehive Matrices from Apiaries Located in Different Landscapes of Western France	Background:The honey bee, Apis mellifera, is frequently used as a sentinel to monitor environmental pollution. In parallel, general weakening and unprecedented colony losses have been reported in Europe and the USA, and many factors are suspected to play a central role in these problems, including infection by pathogens, nutritional stress and pesticide poisoning. Honey bee, honey and pollen samples collected from eighteen apiaries of western France from four different landscape contexts during four different periods in 2008 and in 2009 were analyzed to evaluate the presence of pesticides and veterinary drug residues.Methodology/Findings:A multi-residue analysis of 80 compounds was performed using a modified QuEChERS method, followed by GC-ToF and LC-MS/MS. The analysis revealed that 95.7%, 72.3% and 58.6% of the honey, honey bee and pollen samples, respectively, were contaminated by at least one compound. The frequency of detection was higher in the honey samples (n = 28) than in the pollen (n = 23) or honey bee (n = 20) samples, but the highest concentrations were found in pollen. Although most compounds were rarely found, some of the contaminants reached high concentrations that might lead to adverse effects on bee health. The three most frequent residues were the widely used fungicide carbendazim and two acaricides, amitraz and coumaphos, that are used by beekeepers to control Varroa destructor. Apiaries in rural-cultivated landscapes were more contaminated than those in other landscape contexts, but the differences were not significant. The contamination of the different matrices was shown to be higher in early spring than in all other periods.Conclusions/Significance:Honey bees, honeys and pollens are appropriate sentinels for monitoring pesticide and veterinary drug environmental pollution. This study revealed the widespread occurrence of multiple residues in beehive matrices and suggests a potential issue with the effects of these residues alone or in combination on honey bee health. © 2013 Lambert et al.		abamectin, aldrin, amitraz, bifenthrin, bromopropylate, carbaril, carbendazim, carbofuran, chlorothalonil, chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos methyl, cipermethrin, clofentezine, coumafos, cyfluthrin, cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, dichlorvos, dieldrin, dimethoate, dimpylate, drug residue, endosulfan, eprinomectin, fenarimol, fenitrothion, fenoxycarb, fenvalerate, pesticide residue, article, bee, concentration (parameters), cultivated land, environmental monitoring, France, gas chromatography, honey, honeybee, landscape, limit of detection, limit of quantitation, liquid chromatography, nonhuman, pollen, rural area, seasonal variation, soil pollution, spring, tandem mass spectrometry, time of flight mass spectrometry, Animals, Bees, Chromatography, Gas, Chromatography, Liquid, Drug Residues, France, Honey, Pesticide Residues, Pollen, Tandem Mass Spectrometry, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Varroa destructor	2013-06-17
Balancing control and complexity in field studies of neonicotinoids and honey bee health	Amidst ongoing declines in honey bee health, the contributory role of the newer systemic insecticides continues to be intensely debated. Scores of toxicological field experiments, which bee scientists and regulators in the United States have looked to for definitive causal evidence, indicate a lack of support. This paper analyzes the methodological norms that shape the design and interpretation of field toxicological studies. I argue that contemporary field studies of honey bees and pesticides are underpinned by a "control-oriented" approach, which precludes a serious investigation of the indirect and multifactorial ways in which pesticides could drive declines in honey bee health. I trace the historical rise to prominence of this approach in honey bee toxicology to the development of entomology as a science of insecticide development in the United States. Drawing on "complexity-oriented" knowledge practices in ecology, epidemiology, beekeeping and sociology, I suggest an alternative socio-ecological systems approach, which would entail in situ studies that are less concerned with isolating individual factors and more attentive to the interactive and place-based mix of factors affecting honey bee health. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The effects of pesticides on queen rearing and virus titers in honey bees (Apis mellifera L.)	The effects of sublethal pesticide exposure on queen emergence and virus titers were examined. Queen rearing colonies were fed pollen with chlorpyrifos (CPF) alone (pollen-1) and with CPF and the fungicide Pristine® (pollen-2). Fewer queens emerged when larvae from open foraging (i.e., outside) colonies were reared in colonies fed pollen-1 or 2 compared with when those larvae were reared in outside colonies. Larvae grafted from and reared in colonies fed pollen-2 had lower rates of queen emergence than pollen-1 or outside colonies. Deformed wing virus (DWV) and black queen cell virus were found in nurse bees from colonies fed pollen-1 or 2 and in outside colonies. The viruses also were detected in queen larvae. However, we did not detect virus in emerged queens grafted from and reared in outside colonies. In contrast, DWV was found in all emerged queens grafted from colonies fed pollen-1 or 2 either reared in outside hives or those fed pollen-1 or 2. The results suggest that sublethal exposure of CPF alone but especially when Pristine® is added reduces queen emergence possibly due to compromised immunity in developing queens. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The amitraz strips efficacy in control of Varroa Destructor after many years application of amitraz in apiaries	Amitraz is a varroacide used the longest (over thirty years) and most commonly by Polish beekeepers. This involves high risk of V. destructor developing amitraz resistance. Therefore it is necessary to monitor the effectiveness of treatments to ensure appropriate protection of the honeybee colonies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of amitraz used as the contact varroacide (Biowar 500 formulation) to control V. destructor in honeybee colonies. Field studies were conducted in 2011 and 2012. In both years, the amitraz treatments started in the last weeks of August. Two strips of Biowar 500 (500 mg of amitraz per strip) were inserted into each colony and removed after 8 weeks. The control colonies were left untreated for 8 weeks. After removing the strips the control therapy was conducted in all colonies. The average efficacy of amitraz (E%) calculated for the two years combined, after 6 and 8 weeks of treatment, amounted to 90.6% and 94.6%, respectively. As a result of the natural mortality in the control colonies, the population of parasites lowered only by 16.4% and 23.9% during 6 and 8 weeks. The efficacy of the strips was lower in colonies with larger amount of brood.		Apis mellifera, Varroa destructor	2013-06-01
The science, law and policy of neonicotinoids and bees: A new test case for the precautionary principle	Once more, while facing an analogous risk phenomenon affecting their predominantly homogeneous societal and economic interests, the two sides of the Atlantic seem to adopt diverging stances. Amid the publication of several new studies and a set of EFSA scientific opinions linking the use of the world's most widely used pesticides to bee decline, the European Union adopted a temporary ban on their use. While the Commission does not expressly rely on it, its restrictive decision is clearly based on the controversial precautionary principle. Yet, as it is discussed in this article, the conformity of this decision with the requirements that determine the legal invocation of this principle remains doubtful. © Cambridge University Press 2013.			2013-06-01
Conserving genetic diversity in the honeybee: Comments on Harpur et al. (2012)	The article by Harpur et al. (2012) 'Management increases genetic diversity of honey bees via admixture' concludes that '.honey bees do not suffer from reduced genetic diversity caused by management and, consequently, that reduced genetic diversity is probably not contributing to declines of managed Apis mellifera populations'. In the light of current honeybee and beekeeping declines and their consequences for honeybee conservation and the pollination services they provide, we would like to express our concern about the conclusions drawn from the results of Harpur et al. (2012). While many honeybee management practices do not imply admixture, we are convinced that the large-scale genetic homogenization of admixed populations could drive the loss of valuable local adaptations. We also point out that the authors did not account for the extensive gene flow that occurs between managed and wild/feral honeybee populations and raise concerns about the data set used. Finally, we caution against underestimating the importance of genetic diversity for honeybee colonies and highlight the importance of promoting the use of endemic honeybee subspecies in apiculture. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.		admixture, animal, animal husbandry, apiculture, Apis mellifera, bee, genetic variability, genetics, honeybee conservation, population genetics, review, admixture, Apis mellifera, beekeeping, honeybee conservation, Animal Husbandry, Animals, Bees, Genetic Variation, Genetics, Population, Apis mellifera	2013-06-01
Acute exposure to a sublethal dose of imidacloprid and coumaphos enhances olfactory learning and memory in the honeybee Apis mellifera	The decline of honeybees and other pollinating insects is a current cause for concern. A major factor implicated in their decline is exposure to agricultural chemicals, in particular the neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid. Honeybees are also subjected to additional chemical exposure when beekeepers treat hives with acaricides to combat the mite Varroa destructor. Here, we assess the effects of acute sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, and the organophosphate acaricide coumaphos, on honey bee learning and memory. Imidacloprid had little effect on performance in a six-trial olfactory conditioning assay, while coumaphos caused a modest impairment. We report a surprising lack of additive adverse effects when both compounds were administered simultaneously, which instead produced a modest improvement in learning and memory. © 2012 The Author(s).		coumafos, imidacloprid, imidazole derivative, insecticide, nitro derivative, animal, animal behavior, article, bee, drug effect, learning, memory, odor, physiology, Animals, Bees, Behavior, Animal, Coumaphos, Imidazoles, Insecticides, Learning, Memory, Nitro Compounds, Smell	2013-06-01
Nosemosis and its effect on performance of honey bees - A review	Nosemosis is one of the most widespread disease of honey bees with potentially serious effects on beekeeping. The transmission of nosema disease to the adult honey bees infecting epithelial cells, lining the midgut after spores are ingested causes various clinical symptoms, including digestive disorders, shortened life span, decreased population size and negative effects on honey production capacity. In this review, the historical and recent data on Nosema, covering the tissue tropism, pathology, diagnoses, multiplication, phylogeny and genetics, virulence, clinical symptoms, control, and transmission of this important honey bee parasite and discuss these within the wider theoretical concepts, have been summarized.		acetic acid, fumagillin, ribosome RNA, animal behavior, apiculture, fumigation, fungal detection, fungal genetics, fungal reproduction, fungal virulence, fungus isolation, fungus spore, fungus transmission, genetic analysis, honeybee, host pathogen interaction, immune deficiency, infection control, learning disorder, nonhuman, Nosema, Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae, nosemosis, organism colony, phylogeny, physical performance, prevalence, pyrosequencing, queen (insect), review, RNA gene, sequence homology, species distribution, symptomatology, tissue tropism, tropism, worker (insect), zoonosis, Apis mellifera, Nosema, Nosema apis	2013-06-01
Diverse Strategies for Vertical Symbiont Transmission among Subsocial Stinkbugs	Sociality may affect symbiosis and vice versa. Many plant-sucking stinkbugs harbor mutualistic bacterial symbionts in the midgut. In the superfamily Pentatomoidea, adult females excrete symbiont-containing materials from the anus, which their offspring ingest orally and establish vertical symbiont transmission. In many stinkbug families whose members are mostly non-social, females excrete symbiont-containing materials onto/beside eggs upon oviposition. However, exceptional cases have been reported from two subsocial species representing the closely related families Cydnidae and Parastrachiidae, wherein females remain nearby eggs for maternal care after oviposition, and provide their offspring with symbiont-containing secretions at later stages, either just before or after hatching. These observations suggested that sociality of the host stinkbugs may be correlated with their symbiont transmission strategies. However, we found that cydnid stinkbugs of the genus Adomerus, which are associated with gammaproteobacterial gut symbionts and exhibit elaborate maternal care over their offspring, smear symbiont-containing secretions onto eggs upon oviposition as many non-social stinkbugs do. Surface sterilization of the eggs resulted in aposymbiotic insects of slower growth, smaller size and abnormal body coloration, indicating vertical symbiont transmission via egg surface contamination and presumable beneficial nature of the symbiosis. The Adomerus symbionts exhibited AT-biased nucleotide compositions, accelerated molecular evolutionary rates and reduced genome size, while these degenerative genomic traits were less severe than those in the symbiont of a subsocial parastrachiid. These results suggest that not only sociality but also other ecological and evolutionary aspects of the host stinkbugs, including the host-symbiont co-evolutionary history, may have substantially affected their symbiont transmission strategies.

Honey constituents up-regulate detoxification and immunity genes in the western honey bee Apis mellifera	As a managed pollinator, the honey bee Apis mellifera is critical to the American agricultural enterprise. Recent colony losses have thus raised concerns; possible explanations for bee decline include nutritional deficiencies and exposures to pesticides and pathogens. We determined that constituents found in honey, including p-coumaric acid, pinocembrin, and pinobanksin 5-methyl ether, specifically induce detoxification genes. These inducers are primarily found not in nectar but in pollen in the case of p-coumaric acid (a monomer of sporopollenin, the principal constituent of pollen cell walls) and propolis, a resinous material gathered and processed by bees to line wax cells. RNA-seq analysis (massively parallel RNA sequencing) revealed that p-coumaric acid specifically up-regulates all classes of detoxification genes as well as select antimicrobial peptide genes. This up-regulation has functional significance in that that adding p-coumaric acid to a diet of sucrose increases midgut metabolism of coumaphos, a widely used in-hive acaricide, by ̃60%. As a major component of pollen grains, p-coumaric acid is ubiquitous in the natural diet of honey bees and may function as a nutraceutical regulating immune and detoxification processes. The widespread apicultural use of honey substitutes, including high-fructose corn syrup, may thus compromise the ability of honey bees to cope with pesticides and pathogens and contribute to colony losses.		coumafos, coumaric acid, pinocembrine, propolis, sucrose, Apis mellifera, article, detoxification, honey, metabolism, nonhuman, pollen, priority journal, upregulation, abaecin, cytochrome P450, Animals, Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides, Bees, Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid, Colony Collapse, Coumaphos, Coumaric Acids, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, Flavanones, Gene Expression Regulation, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, Honey, Metabolic Detoxication, Drug, Organophosphate Poisoning, Pollen, Propolis, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Tandem Mass Spectrometry, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Zea mays	2013-05-28
Reduction in homing flights in the honey bee Apis mellifera after a sublethal dose of neonicotinoid insecticides	The negative effects of a commonly applied systemic insecticide, neonicotinoid, on the honey bee Apis mellifera L. are of great concern worldwide, as the use of the chemical is expanding. Recently, special attention has been paid to the sublethal effects of insecticides. An increasing number of studies has identified sublethal effects on the honey bee in the laboratory or in experimental cages, but so far, few studies have examined sublethal effects in the field. To reveal sublethal effects under field conditions, I examined whether the proportion of successful homing flights by foraging honey bees during 30 min after release decreased after bees were topically exposed to insecticides. Honey bees were treated with two types of neonicotinoid insecticide (clothianidin, dinotefuran) and two types of previously common insecticide (etofenprox [pyrethroid] and fenitrothion [organophosphate]) at five different doses (one-half, one-fourth, one-tenth, one-twentieth, and one-fortieth of their median lethal dose - LD50). Then the bees were released 500 m from their hives in the field. The proportions of successful homing flights by bees exposed to neonicotinoids and pyrethroid decreased with doses of one-tenth LD50 (2.18 ng/ head for clothianidin, 7.5 ng/ head for dinotefuran) or more and one-fourth LD50 (32.5 ng/ head for pyrethroid) or more, respectively, whereas bees exposed to organophosphate did not significantly show a response at any sublethal dose though the trend in decline appeared to. Flight times were not significantly different among treatments at any dose. These results indicate that neonicotinoid and pyrethroid exposure reduced successful homing flights at doses far below the LD50 in the field. Moreover, neonicotinoid caused reductions at relatively lower exposure than pyrethroid.			2013-05-16
Nosema spp. infection and its negative effects on honey bees (Apis mellifera iberiensis) at the colony level	Nosemosis caused by the microsporidia Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae are among the most common pathologies affecting adult honey bees. N. apis infection has been associated with a reduced lifespan of infected bees and increased winter mortality, and its negative impact on colony strength and productivity has been described in several studies. By contrast, when the effects of nosemosis type C, caused by N. ceranae infection, have been analysed at the colony level, these studies have largely focused on collapse as a response to infection without addressing the potential sub-clinical effects on colony strength and productivity. Given the spread and prevalence of N. ceranae worldwide, we set out here to characterize the sub-clinical and clinical signs of N. ceranae infection on colony strength and productivity. We evaluated the evolution of 50 honey bee colonies naturally infected by Nosema (mainly N. ceranae) over a one year period. Under our experimental conditions, N. ceranae infection was highly pathogenic for honey bee colonies, producing significant reductions in colony size, brood rearing and honey production. These deleterious effects at the colony level may affect beekeeping profitability and have serious consequences on pollination. Further research is necessary to identify possible treatments or beekeeping techniques that will limit the rapid spread of this dangerous emerging disease. © 2013 Botías et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Exposure to multiple cholinergic pesticides impairs olfactory learning and memory in honeybees	Pesticides are important agricultural tools often used in combination to avoid resistance in target pest species, but there is growing concern that their widespread use contributes to the decline of pollinator populations. Pollinators perform sophisticated behaviours while foraging that require them to learn and remember floral traits associated with food, but we know relatively little about the way that combined exposure to multiple pesticides affects neural function and behaviour. The experiments reported here show that prolonged exposure to field-realistic concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and the organophosphate acetylcholinesterase inhibitor coumaphos and their combination impairs olfactory learning and memory formation in the honeybee. Using a method for classical conditioning of proboscis extension, honeybees were trained in either a massed or spaced conditioning protocol to examine how these pesticides affected performance during learning and short- and long-term memory tasks. We found that bees exposed to imidacloprid, coumaphos, or a combination of these compounds, were less likely to express conditioned proboscis extension towards an odor associated with reward. Bees exposed to imidacloprid were less likely to form a long-term memory, whereas bees exposed to coumaphos were only less likely to respond during the short-term memory test after massed conditioning. Imidacloprid, coumaphos and a combination of the two compounds impaired the bees' ability to differentiate the conditioned odour from a novel odour during the memory test. Our results demonstrate that exposure to sublethal doses of combined cholinergic pesticides significantly impairs important behaviours involved in foraging, implying that pollinator population decline could be the result of a failure of neural function of bees exposed to pesticides in agricultural landscapes. © 2013.

Fungicide contamination reduces beneficial fungi in bee bread based on an area-wide field study in honey bee, apis mellifera, colonies	Fermentation by fungi converts stored pollen into bee bread that is fed to honey bee larvae, Apis mellifera, so the diversity of fungi in bee bread may be related to its food value. To explore the relationship between fungicide exposure and bee bread fungi, samples of bee bread collected from bee colonies pollinating orchards from 7 locations over 2 years were analyzed for fungicide residues and fungus composition. There were detectable levels of fungicides from regions that were sprayed before bloom. An organic orchard had the highest quantity and variety of fungicides, likely due to the presence of treated orchards within bees flight range. Aspergillus, Penicillium, Rhizopus, and Cladosporium (beneficial fungi) were the primary fungal isolates found, regardless of habitat differences. There was some variation in fungal components amongst colonies, even within the same apiary. The variable components were Absidia, Alternaria, Aureobasidium, Bipolaris, Fusarium, Geotrichum, Mucor, Nigrospora, Paecilomyces, Scopulariopsis, and Trichoderma. The number of fungal isolates was reduced as an effect of fungicide contamination. Aspergillus abundance was particularly affected by increased fungicide levels, as indicated by Simpson's diversity index.

Cholinergic pesticides cause mushroom body neuronal inactivation in honeybees	Pesticides that target cholinergic neurotransmission are highly effective, but their use has been implicated in insect pollinator population decline. Honeybees are exposed to two widely used classes of cholinergic pesticide: neonicotinoids (nicotinic receptor agonists) and organophosphate miticides (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors). Although sublethal levels of neonicotinoids are known to disrupt honeybee learning and behaviour, the neurophysiological basis of these effects has not been shown. Here, using recordings from mushroom body Kenyon cells in acutely isolated honeybee brain, we show that the neonicotinoids imidacloprid and clothianidin, and the organophosphate miticide coumaphos oxon, cause a depolarization-block of neuronal firing and inhibit nicotinic responses. These effects are observed at concentrations that are encountered by foraging honeybees and within the hive, and are additive with combined application. Our findings demonstrate a neuronal mechanism that may account for the cognitive impairments caused by neonicotinoids, and predict that exposure to multiple pesticides that target cholinergic signalling will cause enhanced toxicity to pollinators. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Invertebrate welfare: An overlooked issue	While invertebrates make up the majority of animal species, their welfare is overlooked compared to the concern shown to vertebrates. This fact is highlighted by the near absence of regulations in animal research, with the exception of cephalopods in the European Union. This is often justified by assumptions that invertebrates do not experience pain and stress while lacking the capacity for higher order cognitive functions. Recent research suggests that invertebrates may be just as capable as vertebrates in experiencing pain and stress, and some species display comparable cognitive capacities. Another obstacle is the negative view of invertebrates by the public, which often regards them as pests with no individual personalities, gastronomic entities, or individuals for scientific experimentation without rules. Increasingly, studies have revealed that invertebrates possess individual profiles comparable to the personalities found in vertebrates. Given the large economic impact of invertebrates, developing certain attitude changes in invertebrate welfare may be beneficial for producers while providing higher welfare conditions for the animals. While the immense number and type of species makes it difficult to suggest that all invertebrates will benefit from increased welfare, in this review we provide evidence that the topic of invertebrate welfare should be revisited, more thoroughly investigated, and in cases where appropriate, formally instituted.		animal, animal rights, animal welfare, article, consciousness, European Union, invertebrate, mental stress, pain, psychological aspect, Animal Rights, Animal Welfare, Animals, Consciousness, European Union, Invertebrates, Pain, Stress, Psychological	2013-04-02
Interactive effect of reduced pollen availability and Varroa destructor infestation limits growth and protein content of young honey bees	Varroa destructor in combination with one or more stressors, such as low food availability or chemical exposure, is considered to be one of the main causes for honey bee colony losses. We examined the interactive effect of pollen availability on the protein content and body weight of young bees that emerged with and without V. destructor infestation. With reduced pollen availability, and the coherent reduced nutritional protein, we expected that V. destructor infestation during the pupal stage would have a larger negative effect on bee development than without infestation. Moreover, when raised with ample pollen available after emergence, infested pupae were expected not to be able to compensate for early losses due to V. destructor. We found that both V. destructor infestation and reduced pollen availability reduced body weight, abdominal protein level, and increased the head to abdomen protein ratio. The availability of pollen did indeed not result in compensation for reduced mass and protein content caused by V. destructor infestation in young bees after 1. week of their adult life. Both V. destructor and nutrition are top concerns for those studying honey bee health and this study demonstrates that both have substantial effects on young bees and that ample available pollen cannot compensate for reduced mass and protein content caused by V. destructor parasitism. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.		protein, developmental biology, developmental stage, emergence, food availability, growth response, honeybee, mite, nutrition, pollen, protein, animal, article, bee, female, growth, development and aging, insect, metabolism, parasitology, physiology, pollen, Varroidae, Animals, Bees, Female, Pollen, Proteins, Pupa, Varroidae, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Varroa destructor	2013-04-01
Effect of in-hive miticides on drone honey bee survival and sperm viability	The survival of a honey bee colony depends, in part, on the reproductive success of the queen, which in turn depends on the viability of sperm produced by drones with which the queen mates. Colony success also depends on management of the ectoparasitic bee mite, Varroa destructor, which has historically been achieved using miticides that may also impact honey bee health. Previous work has demonstrated that the exposure of drone honey bees to miticidal Checkmite+™ strips (coumaphos) can result in decreased sperm viability. In this study we applied a range of sublethal doses of six miticides (tau-fluvalinate, coumaphos, fenpyroximate, amitraz, thymol and oxalic acid) to 1-4 day old adult drones. We returned drones to their home colony and re-collected them two to three weeks later to assess sperm viability using SYBR14 and propidium iodide stains. Counts of live and dead sperm were automated using the EBImage library in the R statistical environment. Sperm viability was not affected by any of the six miticide treatments, which suggests that acute miticide exposure in adult drones has little effect on drones' reproductive potential. However, two of the six miticides tested had an effect on drone recapture rate: fenpyroximate reduced and thymol increased the likelihood of drone recapture. These results suggest that future research on the effect of pesticides to drone sperm viability should focus on exposure in the immature stages and that beekeepers concerned with drone reproductive health may be able to safely apply miticides when only adult drones are present.

A national survey of managed honey bee 2011-12 winter colony losses in the United States: Results from the bee informed partnership	Estimates of winter loss for managed honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies are an important measure of honey bee health and productivity. We used data from 5,500 US beekeepers (5,244 backyard, 189 sideline and 67 commercial beekeepers) who responded to the April 2012 Bee Informed Partnership Winter Colony Loss Survey and calculated loss as the difference in the number of colonies between October 1, 2011 and April 1, 2012, adjusting for increases and decreases over that period. In the US, the total colony loss was 22.5% for the 2011-12 winter; 45.1% (n = 2,482) of respondents reported no colony loss. Total loss during 2011-12 was substantially lower than loss during 2010-11 (29.9%). Of the 4,484 respondents who kept bees in 2010-11 and 2011-12, 72.0% reported that the loss during 2011-12 was smaller or similar to the loss during 2010-11. There was substantial variation in total loss by state (range 6.2% to 47.7%). The average loss per beekeeping operation was 25.4%, but the average loss was not significantly different by operation type (backyard, sideline, commercial). The average self-reported acceptable loss per respondent was 13.7%; 46.8% (n = 2,259) of respondents experienced winter colony losses in excess of the average acceptable loss. Of beekeepers who reported losing at least one colony during 2011-12, the leading self-identified causes of mortality were weak condition in the fall and queen failure. Respondents who indicated poor wintering conditions, CCD, or pesticides as a leading cause of mortality suffered a higher average loss when compared to beekeepers who did not list these as potential causes.

Fate of dermally applied miticides fluvalinate and amitraz within honey bee (hymenoptera: Apidae) bodies	Varroa mites, Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman, are economically important pests of honey bees. Varroa mites are principally controlled within honey bee colonies using miticides. However, despite their importance in managing mite populations for apiculture, potential effects of miticides on honey bees are poorly understood. Using gas chromatography-flame ionization detection, we investigated concentrations, over variable time frames and within different body regions, of two commonly used miticides, tau-fluvalinate and amitraz, after dermal exposure to honey bees. We also quantified mortality of honey bees exposed to each miticide at both a low and high dose. Significant differences were observed in distributions of miticides among body regions. Within honey bee body parts, tau-fluvalinate was more readily absorbed and decreased in concentration more rapidly than amitraz. Mortality increased with higher dosages of miticides, and at higher dosages mortality was greater from fluvalinate than from amitraz. For individual honeybees, our results for rate of breakdown suggest that fluvalinate may be the preferred miticide for apiculturists, whereas our mortality results suggest that amitraz may be preferable. Either choice must be weighed against geographic variation in varroa resistance to each pesticide and attendant costs of parasitism. © 2013 Entomological Society of America.		acaricide, amitraz, fluvalinate, nitrile, pyrethroid, toluidine derivative, animal, article, bee, Canada, drug effect, gas chromatography, intradermal drug administration, tissue distribution, Acaricides, Administration, Cutaneous, Animals, Bees, Flame Ionization, Nitriles, Nova Scotia, Pyrethrins, Tissue Distribution, Toluidines, Acari, Apidae, Apis mellifera, Hymenoptera, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2013-04-01
Standard epidemiological methods to understand and improve Apis mellifera health	In this paper, we describe the use of epidemiological methods to understand and reduce honey bee morbidity and mortality. Essential terms are presented and defined and we also give examples for their use. Defining such terms as disease, population, sensitivity, and specificity, provides a framework for epidemiological comparisons. The term population, in particular, is quite complex for an organism like the honey bee because one can view "epidemiological unit" as individual bees, colonies, apiaries, or operations. The population of interest must, therefore, be clearly defined. Equations and explanations of how to calculate measures of disease rates in a population are provided. There are two types of study design; observational and experimental. The advantages and limitations of both are discussed. Approaches to calculate and interpret results are detailed. Methods for calculating epidemiological measures such as detection of rare events, associating exposure and disease (Odds Ratio and Relative Risk), and comparing prevalence and incidence are discussed. Naturally, for beekeepers, the adoption of any management system must have economic advantage. We present a means to determine the cost and benefit of the treatment in order determine its net benefit. Lastly, this paper presents a discussion of the use of Hill's criteria for inferring causal relationships. This framework for judging cause-effect relationships supports a repeatable and quantitative evaluation process at the population or landscape level. Hill's criteria disaggregate the different kinds of evidence, allowing the scientist to consider each type of evidence individually and objectively, using a quantitative scoring method for drawing conclusions. It is hoped that the epidemiological approach will be more broadly used to study and negate honey bee disease. Copyright © IBRA 2013.		Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2013-04-01
Standard methods for maintaining adult Apis mellifera in cages under in vitro laboratory conditions	Adult honey bees are maintained in vitro in laboratory cages for a variety of purposes. For example, researchers may wish to perform experiments on honey bees caged individually or in groups to study aspects of parasitology, toxicology, or physiology under highly controlled conditions, or they may cage whole frames to obtain newly emerged workers of known age cohorts. Regardless of purpose, researchers must manage a number of variables, ranging from selection of study subjects (e.g. honey bee subspecies) to experimental environment (e.g. temperature and relative humidity). Although decisions made by researchers may not necessarily jeopardize the scientific rigour of an experiment, they may profoundly affect results, and may make comparisons with similar, but independent, studies difficult. Focusing primarily on workers, we provide recommendations for maintaining adults under in vitro laboratory conditions, whilst acknowledging gaps in our understanding that require further attention. We specifically describe how to properly obtain honey bees, and how to choose appropriate cages, incubator conditions, and food to obtain biologically relevant and comparable experimental results. Additionally, we provide broad recommendations for experimental design and statistical analyses of data that arises from experiments using caged honey bees. The ultimate goal of this, and of all COLOSS BEEBOOK papers, is not to stifle science with restrictions, but rather to provide researchers with the appropriate tools to generate comparable data that will build upon our current understanding of honey bees Copyright © IBRA 2013.

Chitin synthesis inhibitors: Old molecules and new developments	Chitin is the most abundant natural aminopolysaccharide and serves as a structural component of extracellular matrices. It is found in fungal septa, spores, and cell walls, and in arthropod cuticles and peritrophic matrices, squid pens, mollusk shells, nematode egg shells, and some protozoan cyst walls. As prokaryotes, plants and vertebrates including humans do not produce chitin, its synthesis is considered as an attractive target site for fungicides, insecticides, and acaricides. Although no chitin synthesis inhibitor has been developed into a therapeutic drug to treat fungal infections in humans, a larger number of compounds have been successfully launched worldwide to combat arthropod pests in agriculture and forestry. This review summarizes the latest advances on the mode of action of chitin synthesis inhibitors with a special focus on those molecules that act on a postcatalytic step of chitin synthesis. © 2012 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.		acaricide, benzoylurea, chitin, insecticide, organic compound, amino acid sequence, animal, biosynthesis, chitin synthesis inhibitor, cuticle, drug development, etoxazole, methodology, molecular genetics, review, acaricide, benzoylurea, chitin synthesis inhibitor, cuticle, etoxazole, insecticide, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Chitin, Drug Discovery, Molecular Sequence Data, Organic Chemicals, Animalia, Arthropoda, Bacteria (microorganisms), Cephalopoda, Prokaryota, Protozoa, Vertebrata, acaricide, benzoylurea, chitin synthesis inhibitor, cuticle, etoxazole, insecticide	2013-04-01
Standard methods for artificial rearing of Apis mellifera larvae	Originally, a method to rear worker honey bee larvae in vitro was introduced into the field of bee biology to analyse honey bee physiology and caste development. Recently, it has become an increasingly important method in bee pathology and toxicology. The in vitro method of rearing larvae is complex and can be developed as an art by itself, especially if the aim is to obtain queens or worker bees which, for example, can be re-introduced into the colony as able members. However, a more pragmatic approach to in vitro rearing of larvae is also possible and justified if the aim is to focus on certain pathogens or compounds to be tested. It is up to the researcher(s) to decide on the appropriate experimental establishment and design. This paper will help with this decision and provide guidelines on how to adjust the method of in vitro rearing according to the specific needs of the scientific project. Copyright © IBRA 2013.

Be(e)coming experts: The controversy over insecticides in the honey bee colony collapse disorder	In this article, we explore the politics of expertise in an ongoing controversy in the United States over the role of certain insecticides in colony collapse disorder - a phenomenon involving mass die-offs of honey bees. Numerous long-time commercial beekeepers contend that newer systemic agricultural insecticides are a crucial part of the cocktail of factors responsible for colony collapse disorder. Many scientists actively researching colony collapse disorder reject the beekeepers' claims, citing the lack of conclusive evidence from field experiments by academic and industry toxicologists. US Environmental Protection Agency regulators, in turn, privilege the latters' approach to the issue, and use the lack of conclusive evidence of systemic insecticides' role in colony collapse disorder to justify permitting these chemicals to remain on the market. Drawing on semistructured interviews with key players in the controversy, as well as published documents and ethnographic data, we show how a set of research norms and practices from agricultural entomology came to dominate the investigation of the links between pesticides and honey bee health, and how the epistemological dominance of these norms and practices served to marginalize the knowledge claims and policy positions of commercial beekeepers in the colony collapse disorder controversy. We conclude with a discussion of how the colony collapse disorder case can help us think about the nature and politics of expertise. © The Author(s) 2012.			2013-03-28
Varroa-Virus Interaction in Collapsing Honey Bee Colonies	Varroa mites and viruses are the currently the high-profile suspects in collapsing bee colonies. Therefore, seasonal variation in varroa load and viruses (Acute-Kashmir-Israeli complex (AKI) and Deformed Wing Virus (DWV)) were monitored in a year-long study. We investigated the viral titres in honey bees and varroa mites from 23 colonies (15 apiaries) under three treatment conditions: Organic acids (11 colonies), pyrethroid (9 colonies) and untreated (3 colonies). Approximately 200 bees were sampled every month from April 2011 to October 2011, and April 2012. The 200 bees were split to 10 subsamples of 20 bees and analysed separately, which allows us to determine the prevalence of virus-infected bees. The treatment efficacy was often low for both treatments. In colonies where varroa treatment reduced the mite load, colonies overwintered successfully, allowing the mites and viruses to be carried over with the bees into the next season. In general, AKI and DWV titres did not show any notable response to the treatment and steadily increased over the season from April to October. In the untreated control group, titres increased most dramatically. Viral copies were correlated to number of varroa mites. Most colonies that collapsed over the winter had significantly higher AKI and DWV titres in October compared to survivors. Only treated colonies survived the winter. We discuss our results in relation to the varroa-virus model developed by Stephen Martin. © 2013 Francis et al.		article, bee disease, colony collapse, controlled study, deformed wing virus, Dicistroviridae, honeybee, Kashmir bee virus, nonhuman, organism colony, organismal interaction, seasonal variation, Varroa, virus, virus detection, virus load, virus titration, Animals, Beekeeping, Bees, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Insect Viruses, Mite Infestations, Seasons, Varroidae, Viral Load, Virus Diseases	2013-03-19

Predation pressure dynamics study of the recently introduced honeybee killer Vespa velutina: Learning from the enemy	Following the recent introduction of Vespa velutina into France, an increase in predation on domestic honeybees, Apis mellifera, has resulted from the dispersion of this hornet across the country. We aimed at providing its predation pressure dynamics at bee hives in two sites by using food traps that could be used as a comparison in future years. The number of trapped and chasing hornets in each apiary was correlated. Predation lasted 5 months on our two sites; 916 and 1,894 hornets were trapped on each site, respectively. Predation at bee hives was found to be affected by wind speed and by the seasonal effect of temperature and humidity. We also show that V. velutina queens and males were present during unusual periods in our traps, which may be significant to understanding their life cycle. These results are discussed with reference to the biology of other Vespine species. This study represents the first monitoring of V. velutina predation pressure dynamics in France. It constitutes an initial database for pest management and suggests ways of protecting bee hives. © 2012 INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.		database, dispersion, entomology, honeybee, humidity, integrated pest management, introduced species, invasive species, life cycle, predation, seasonality, wasp, France, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Vespa, Vespa velutina, Vespidae	2013-03-01
Bee health: The role of pesticides*	Bees, both commercially managed honey bees and wild bees, play an important role in global food production. In the United States, the value of honey bees only as commercial pollinators in U.S. food production is estimated at about $15 billion to $20 billion annually. The estimated value of other types of insect pollinators, including wild bees, to U.S. food production is not available. Given their importance to food production, many have expressed concern about whether a "pollinator crisis" has been occurring in recent decades. In the United States, commercial migratory beekeepers along the East Coast of the United States began reporting sharp declines in 2006 in their honey bee colonies. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that overwinter colony losses from 2006 to 2011 averaged more than 32% annually. This issue remained legislatively active in the 110th Congress and resulted in increased funding for pollinator research, among other types of farm program support, as part of the 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246). Congressional interest in the health of honey bees and other pollinators has continued in the 112th Congress (e.g., H.R. 2381, H.R. 6083, and S. 3240) and may extend into the 113th Congress.This report:• Describes changes in managed and wild bee populations, given readily available data and information. It focuses on managed and wild bees only, and excludes other types of pollinators, including other insects, birds, and bats. Data on managed honey bees are limited, and do not provide a comprehensive view of changes in bee populations. Data for wild bee populations are even more limited.• Provides a listing of the range of possible factors thought to be negatively affecting managed and wild bee populations. In addition to pesticides, other identified factors include bee pests and diseases, diet and nutrition, genetics, habitat loss and other environmental stressors, and beekeeping management issues, as well as the possibility that bees are being negatively affected by cumulative, multiple exposures and/or the interactive effects of each of these factors.• Briefly summarizes readily available scientific research and analysis regarding the potential role of pesticides among the factors affecting the health and well-being of bees, as well as the statutory authority and related regulatory activities of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) related to pesticide use.A 2007 report by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, Status of Pollinators in North America, provides a more detailed scientific context for this report and may be consulted for more in depth understanding about bee health. That study concluded that many factors contribute to pollinator declines in North America, and CRS accedes to that conclusion.Accordingly, the focus of this report on bee exposure to pesticides is not intended to imply that pesticides are any more important in influencing the health and wellness of bees than any of the other identified factors influencing bee health. Pesticides are only one of the many influences on bee health.Because neonicotinoid pesticides have been the focus of concerns in Europe and in the United States, this report briefly describes recent scientific research related to possible effects of exposure to these pesticides on bees.The report concludes with a summary of recent regulatory activity regarding neonicotinoids at EPA, the federal agency charged with assessing risks and regulating U.S. sale and use of pesticides. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Present and potential use of bees as managed pollinators in Mexico 1	A diversity of crops is grown in Mexico Of the plants that produce fruits and/or seeds for human consumption, 85% depend to some degree on pollinators for efficient production Mexico also has a great diversity of native bees, some of which have been recognized as having potential for use as managed pollinators; defined as a semi-domesticated species, produced in large quantities, and bought and sold commercially The objective of the present work was to review the species of bees presently commercially available in Mexico as managed pollinators and to analyze in particular: 1) their commercial availability, 2) crops for which they are used, and 3) the perspectives for their sustainable use and conservation Presently, only two species of bees are used commercially in Mexico: the honey bee, Apis mellifera L., and the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens Cresson Mexican native bee species have been used experimentally, but at this time, none is commercially available The principal threats to the conservation of native bees in Mexico are the elevated rate of deforestation combined with intense use of agrochemicals and particularly insecticides for control of pests in extensive monocultures Continued research and conservation programs considering native bee species are needed to ensure the survival of as many species as possible to provide a wide array of biological characteristics with potential for use as managed pollinators in Mexico This is critical to ensure the future necessities of the wide diversity of Mexican crops with unique agronomic characteristics within the diversity of habitats where they are cultivated.

Honey bee colony collapse disorder*	Starting in late 2006, commercial migratory beekeepers along the East Coast of the United States began reporting sharp declines in their honey bee colonies. Because of the severity and unusual circumstances of these colony declines, scientists named this phenomenon colony collapse disorder (CCD). Reports indicate that beekeepers in most states have been affected. Overall, the number of managed honey bee colonies dropped an estimated 35.8% and 31.8% in the winters of 2007/2008 and 2006/2007, respectively. Preliminary loss estimates for the 2008/2009 winter are reported at 28.6%. To date, the precise reasons for colony losses are not yet known.Honey bees are the most economically valuable pollinators of agricultural crops worldwide. Scientists at universities and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) frequently assert that bee pollination is involved in about one-third of the U.S. diet, and contributes to the production of a wide range of fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, forage crops, some field crops, and other specialty crops. The monetary value of honey bees as commercial pollinators in the United States is estimated at about $15-$20 billion annually.Honey bee colony losses are not uncommon. However, losses in recent years differ from past situations in that colony losses are occurring mostly because bees are failing to return to the hive (which is largely uncharacteristic of bee behavior); bee colony losses have been rapid; colony losses are occurring in large numbers; and the reason(s) for these losses remains largely unknown.Based on the available research over the past few years on the numerous possible causes of CCD, USDA concluded in its 2007-2008 progress report (released in June 2009) that "it now seems clear that no single factor alone is responsible for the malady." This has led researchers to further examine the hypothesis that CCD may be "a syndrome caused by many different factors, working in combination or synergistically." Currently, USDA states, researchers are focusing on three major possibilities: • pesticides that may be having unexpected negative effects on honey bees;• a new parasite or pathogen that may be attacking honey bees, such as the parasite Nosema ceranae or viruses; and• a combination of existing stresses that may compromise the immune system of bees and disrupt their social system, making colonies more susceptible to disease and collapse. Stresses could include high levels of infection by the Varroa mite; poor nutrition due to apiary overcrowding, pollination of crops with low nutritional value, or pollen or nectar scarcity; exposure to limited or contaminated water supplies; and migratory stress.Funding for honey bee and CCD research at USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has increased sharply, following both the enactment of the 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246) and the FY2009 and FY2010 appropriations process (P.L. 111-8 and P.L. 111-80, respectively). These legislative actions contained additional provisions that would, among other things, provide additional funding for research and conservation programs addressing honey bees and pollinators. Total ARS funding for honey bee and CCD research averaged more than $7.7 million each in FY2007 and FY2008, increasing to $8.3 million in FY2009 and $9.8 million for FY2010. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Trace analysis of pollutants by use of honeybees, immunoassays, and chemiluminescence detection	Specific and sensitive analysis to reveal and monitor the wide variety of chemical contaminants polluting all environment compartments, feed, and food is urgently required because of the increasing attention devoted to the environment and health protection. Our research group has been involved in monitoring the presence and distribution of agrochemicals by monitoring beehives distributed throughout the area studied. Honeybees have been used both as biosensors, because the pesticides affect their viability, and as "contaminant collectors" for all environmental pollutants. We focused our research on the development of analytical procedures able to reveal and quantify pesticides in different samples but with a special attention to the complex honeybee matrix. Specific extraction and purification procedures have been developed and some are still under optimization. The analytes of interest were determined by gas or liquid chromatographic methods and by compound-specific or group-specific immunoassays in the ELISA format, the analytical performance of which was improved by introducing luminescence detection. The range of chemiluminescent immunoassays developed was extended to include the determination of completely different pollutants, for example explosives, volatile organic compounds (including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes), and components of plastics, for example bisphenol A. An easier and portable format, a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) was added to the ELISA format to increase application flexibility in these assays. Aspects of the novelty, the specific characteristics, the analytical performance, and possible future development of the different chromatographic and immunological methods are described and discussed.

Molecular detection of protozoan parasites infecting Apis mellifera colonies in Japan	The role of protozoan parasites in honey bee health and distribution in the world is not well understood. Therefore, we carried out a molecular survey for the presence of Crithidia mellificae and Apicystis bombi in the colonies of both non-native Apis mellifera and native Apis cerana japonica in Japan. We found that A.mellifera, but not A.c.japonica, colonies are parasitized with C.mellificae and A.bombi. Their absence in A.c.japonica colonies indicates that A.mellifera is their native host. Nevertheless, the prevalence in A.mellifera colonies is low compared with other pathogens such as viruses and Nosema microsporidia. Japanese C.mellificae isolates share well-conserved nuclear-encoded gene sequences with Swiss and US isolates. We have found two Japanese haplotypes (A and B) with two nucleotide differences in the kinetoplast-encoded cytochrome b sequence. The haplotype A is identical to Swiss isolate. These results demonstrate that C.mellificae and A.bombi distribute in Asia, Oceania, Europe, and South and North Americas. © 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.		cytochrome b, animal, Apicomplexa, article, bee, Crithidia, DNA fragmentation, DNA sequence, Europe, genetics, haplotype, insect virus, isolation and purification, Japan, North America, Nosema, parasitology, phylogeny, Animals, Apicomplexa, Bees, Crithidia, Cytochromes b, DNA Fragmentation, Europe, Haplotypes, Insect Viruses, Japan, North America, Nosema, Phylogeny, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Apicystis, Apis, Apis cerana, Apis mellifera, Crithidia, Japonica, Microsporidia, Nosema, Protozoa	2013-02-01
Aerial powdering of bees inside mobile cages and the extent of neonicotinoid cloud surrounding corn drillers	Sudden losses of bees have been observed in spring during maize sowing. The death of bees has been correlated with the use of neonicotinoid-coated seed and the toxic particulates emitted by pneumatic drilling machines. The contamination of foragers in flight over the ploughed fields has been hypothesized. The airborne contamination has been proven, both with bees inside fixed cages around the field and in free flight near the driller. A new trial involving mobile cages has been established and consists of making rapid passes with single bees inside cages fixed to an aluminium bar. The bar was moved by two operators at different distances from the working drilling machine. A single pass was shown as sufficient to kill all the bees exposed to exhaust air on the emission side of the drill, when bees were subsequently held in high relative humidity. The extent of toxic cloud around driller was evaluated at the height of 0.5, 1.8 and 3.5m and proved to be about 20m in diameter, with an ellipsoidal shape. The shape may be influenced by working speed of the drill and environmental parameters, and is easily shown by adding talc powder to the seed in the machine hopper. A new driller equipment was evaluated consisting of two tubes inclined towards the soil that direct the exhaust air towards the ground. The survival rate of the bees was not substantially increased using the modified drill and was lower than 50%. Chemical analyses show up to 4000ng of insecticide in single bees with an average content around 300ng. Similar quantities were observed at increased distances from the modified or unmodified drillers. This new evaluation of bee mortality in the field is an innovative biological test to verify the hypothetical efficiency (or not) of driller modifications. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag, GmbH.		aluminum, bee, coating, diameter, drilling, maize, mortality, sowing, toxic substance, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Zea mays	2013-02-01
The microsporidian parasites Nosema ceranae and Nosema apis are widespread in honeybee (Apis mellifera) colonies across Scotland	Nosema ceranae is spreading into areas where Nosema apis already exists. N. ceranae has been reported to cause an asymptomatic infection that may lead, ultimately, to colony collapse. It is thought that there may be a temperature barrier to its infiltration into countries in colder climates. In this study, 71 colonies from Scottish Beekeeper's Association members have been screened for the presence of N. apis and N. ceranae across Scotland. We find that only 11 of the 71 colonies tested positive for spores by microscopy. However, 70.4 % of colonies screened by PCR revealed the presence of both N. ceranae and N. apis, with only 4.2 or 7 % having either strain alone and 18.3 % being Nosema free. A range of geographically separated colonies testing positive for N. ceranae were sequenced to confirm their identity. All nine sequences confirmed the presence of N. ceranae and indicated the presence of a single new variant. Furthermore, two of the spore-containing colonies had only N. ceranae present, and these exhibited the presence of smaller spores that could be distinguished from N. apis by the analysis of average spore size. Differential quantification of the PCR product revealed N. ceranae to be the dominant species in all seven samples tested. In conclusion, N. ceranae is widespread in Scotland where it exists in combination with the endemic N. apis. A single variant, identical to that found in France (DQ374655) except for the addition of a single nucleotide polymorphism, is present in Scotland. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Molecular and phylogenetic characterization of honey bee viruses, Nosema microsporidia, protozoan parasites, and parasitic mites in China	China has the largest number of managed honey bee colonies, which produce the highest quantity of honey and royal jelly in the world; however, the presence of honey bee pathogens and parasites has never been rigorously identified in Chinese apiaries. We thus conducted a molecular survey of honey bee RNA viruses, Nosema microsporidia, protozoan parasites, and tracheal mites associated with nonnative Apis mellifera ligustica and native Apis cerana cerana colonies in China. We found the presence of black queen cell virus (BQCV), chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV), deformed wing virus (DWV), Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), and sacbrood virus (SBV), but not that of acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) or Kashmir bee virus (KBV). DWV was the most prevalent in the tested samples. Phylogenies of Chinese viral isolates demonstrated that genetically heterogeneous populations of BQCV, CBPV, DWV, and A. cerana-infecting SBV, and relatively homogenous populations of IAPV and A. meliifera-infecting new strain of SBV with single origins, are spread in Chinese apiaries. Similar to previous observations in many countries, Nosema ceranae, but not Nosema apis, was prevalent in the tested samples. Crithidia mellificae, but not Apicystis bombi was found in five samples, including one A. c. cerana colony, demonstrating that C. mellificae is capable of infecting multiple honey bee species. Based on kinetoplast-encoded cytochrome b sequences, the C. mellificae isolate from A. c. cerana represents a novel haplotype with 19 nucleotide differences from the Chinese and Japanese isolates from A. m. ligustica. This suggests that A. c. cerana is the native host for this specific haplotype. The tracheal mite, Acarapis woodi, was detected in one A. m. ligustica colony. Our results demonstrate that honey bee RNA viruses, N. ceranae, C. mellificae, and tracheal mites are present in Chinese apiaries, and some might be originated from native Asian honey bees. © 2013 The Authors.

Idiopathic brood disease syndrome and queen events as precursors of colony mortality in migratory beekeeping operations in the eastern United States	Using standard epidemiological methods, this study set out to quantify the risk associated with exposure to easily diagnosed factors on colony mortality and morbidity in three migratory beekeeping operations. Fifty-six percent of all colonies monitored during the 10-month period died. The relative risk (RR) that a colony would die over the short term (∼50 days) was appreciably increased in colonies diagnosed with Idiopathic Brood Disease Syndrome (IBDS), a condition where brood of different ages appear molten on the bottom of cells (RR=3.2), or with a " queen event" (e.g., evidence of queen replacement or failure; RR=3.1). We also found that several risk factors-including the incidence of a poor brood pattern, chalkbood (CB), deformed wing virus (DWV), sacbrood virus (SBV), and exceeding the threshold of 5 Varroa mites per 100 bees-were differentially expressed in different beekeeping operations. Further, we found that a diagnosis of several factors were significantly more or less likely to be associated with a simultaneous diagnosis of another risk factor. These finding support the growing consensus that the causes of colony mortality are multiple and interrelated. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.		animal, apiculture, article, bee, colony collapse, microbiology, parasitology, physiology, population dynamics, risk, United States, virology, Animals, Beekeeping, Bees, Colony Collapse, Population Dynamics, Risk, United States, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Deformed wing virus, Sacbrood virus, Varroa	2013-02-01
Nosema ceranae (Microsporidia), a controversial 21st century honey bee pathogen	The worldwide beekeeping sector has been facing a grave threat, with losses up to 100-1000 times greater than those previously reported. Despite the scale of this honey bee mortality, the causes underlying this phenomenon remain unclear, yet they are thought to be multifactorial processes. Nosema ceranae, a microsporidium recently detected in the European bee all over the world, has been implicated in the global phenomenon of colony loss, although its role remains controversial. A review of the current knowledge about this pathogen is presented focussing on discussion related with divergent results, trying to analyse the differences specially based on different methodologies applied and divisive aspects on pathology while considering a biological or veterinarian point of view. For authors, the disease produced by N.ceranae infection cannot be considered a regional problem but rather a global one, as indicated by the wide prevalence of this parasite in multiple hosts. Not only does this type of nosemosis causes a clear pathology on honeybees at both the individual and colony levels, but it also has significant effects on the production of honeybee products.

Evolutionary plasticity of insect immunity	Many insect genomes have been sequenced and the innate immune responses of several species have been studied by transcriptomics, inviting the comparative analysis of immunity-related genes. Such studies have demonstrated significant evolutionary plasticity, with the emergence of novel proteins and protein domains correlated with insects adapting to both abiotic and biotic environmental stresses. This review article focuses on effector molecules such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and proteinase inhibitors, which display greater evolutionary dynamism than conserved components such as immunity-related signaling molecules. There is increasing evidence to support an extended role for insect AMPs beyond defense against pathogens, including the management of beneficial endosymbionts. The total number of AMPs varies among insects with completed genome sequences, providing intriguing examples of immunity gene expansion and loss. This plasticity is discussed in the context of recent developments in evolutionary ecology suggesting that the maintenance and deployment of immune responses reallocates resources from other fitness-related traits thus requiring fitness trade-offs. Based on our recent studies using both model and non-model insects, I propose that insect immunity genes can be lost when alternative defense strategies with a lower fitness penalty have evolved, such as the so-called social immunity in bees, the chemical sanitation of the microenvironment by some beetles, and the release of antimicrobial secondary metabolites in the hemolymph. Conversely, recent studies provide evidence for the expansion and functional diversification of insect AMPs and proteinase inhibitors to reflect coevolution with a changing pathosphere and/or adaptations to habitats or food associated with microbial contamination. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.		antimicrobial cationic peptide, insect protein, proteinase inhibitor, antimicrobial activity, beetle, endosymbiont, evolutionary biology, fitness, genomics, immunity, life history trait, phenotypic plasticity, secondary metabolite, trade-off, animal, article, genetics, immunology, innate immunity, insect, metabolism, molecular evolution, Animals, Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides, Evolution, Molecular, Immunity, Innate, Insect Proteins, Insects, Protease Inhibitors, Apoidea, Coleoptera, Hexapoda	2013-02-01
Acaricide, Fungicide and Drug Interactions in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera)	Background: Chemical analysis shows that honey bees (Apis mellifera) and hive products contain many pesticides derived from various sources. The most abundant pesticides are acaricides applied by beekeepers to control Varroa destructor. Beekeepers also apply antimicrobial drugs to control bacterial and microsporidial diseases. Fungicides may enter the hive when applied to nearby flowering crops. Acaricides, antimicrobial drugs and fungicides are not highly toxic to bees alone, but in combination there is potential for heightened toxicity due to interactive effects. Methodology/Principal Findings: Laboratory bioassays based on mortality rates in adult worker bees demonstrated interactive effects among acaricides, as well as between acaricides and antimicrobial drugs and between acaricides and fungicides. Toxicity of the acaricide tau-fluvalinate increased in combination with other acaricides and most other compounds tested (15 of 17) while amitraz toxicity was mostly unchanged (1 of 15). The sterol biosynthesis inhibiting (SBI) fungicide prochloraz elevated the toxicity of the acaricides tau-fluvalinate, coumaphos and fenpyroximate, likely through inhibition of detoxicative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activity. Four other SBI fungicides increased the toxicity of tau-fluvalinate in a dose-dependent manner, although possible evidence of P450 induction was observed at the lowest fungicide doses. Non-transitive interactions between some acaricides were observed. Sublethal amitraz pre-treatment increased the toxicity of the three P450-detoxified acaricides, but amitraz toxicity was not changed by sublethal treatment with the same three acaricides. A two-fold change in the toxicity of tau-fluvalinate was observed between years, suggesting a possible change in the genetic composition of the bees tested. Conclusions/Significance: Interactions with acaricides in honey bees are similar to drug interactions in other animals in that P450-mediated detoxication appears to play an important role. Evidence of non-transivity, year-to-year variation and induction of detoxication enzymes indicates that pesticide interactions in bees may be as complex as drug interactions in mammals. © 2013 Johnson et al.		acaricide, amitraz, coumafos, cytochrome P450, fenpyroximate, fluvalinate, fungicide, prochloraz, thymol, unclassified drug, Apis mellifera, article, chemical interaction, chemical pest control, controlled study, detoxification, enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition, LD 50, nonhuman, protein function, Acaricides, Animals, Anti-Infective Agents, Beekeeping, Bees, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, Drug Interactions, Fungicides, Industrial, Honey, Metabolic Detoxication, Drug, Nitriles, Pesticides, Pyrethrins, Toluidines, Varroidae	2013-01-29
Spread and strain determination of Varroa destructor (Acari: Varroidae) in Madagascar since its first report in 2010	Varroa destructor is a major pest in world beekeeping. It was first detected in Madagascar in 2010 on the endemic honeybee Apis mellifera unicolor. To evaluate V. destructor spread dynamics in Madagascar a global survey was conducted in 2011-2012. A total of 695 colonies from 30 districts were inspected for the presence of mites. 2 years after its introduction, nine districts were found infested. Varroa destructor spread was relatively slow compared to other countries with a maximum progression of 40 km per year, the five newly infested districts being located next to the first infested ones. The incidence of mite infestation was also investigated by monitoring 73 colonies from five apiaries during 1 year (2011-2012). Sixty percent of local colony mortality was recorded after 1 year of survey. Varroa destructor strain determination was done by partial sequencing of the cytochrome oxidase I gene of 13 phoretic mites sampled in five districts. A single V. destructor mitochondrial haplotype was detected, the Korean type, also present in the closest African countries. A global pathogen survey was also conducted on the colonies inspected for mite presence. The greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella has been found in all colonies all over the country. Two other pathogens and morphological abnormalities in workers, such as deformed wings, were found associated with only V. destructor presence. A prevention management plan must be implemented to delimit mite spread across the island. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.		mitochondrial DNA, abnormality, apiculture, colony, cytochrome, endemic species, honeybee, mite, mitochondrial DNA, morphology, mortality, moth, parasite infestation, parasite transmission, pathogen, pest control, pest species, worker caste, animal, article, bee, chemistry, DNA sequence, environmental monitoring, genetics, host parasite interaction, incidence, Madagascar, parasitology, pest control, physiology, population dynamics, Varroidae, Animals, Bees, DNA, Mitochondrial, Environmental Monitoring, Host-Parasite Interactions, Incidence, Madagascar, Pest Control, Population Dynamics, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Varroidae, Madagascar, Acari, Apis mellifera, Galleria mellonella, Varroa destructor, Varroidae	2013-01-16
Barrier Immune Effectors Are Maintained during Transition from Nurse to Forager in the Honey Bee	Foragers facilitate horizontal pathogen transmission in honey bee colonies, yet their systemic immune function wanes during transition to this life stage. In general, the insect immune system can be categorized into mechanisms operating at both the barrier epithelial surfaces and at the systemic level. As proposed by the intergenerational transfer theory of aging, such immunosenescence may result from changes in group resource allocation. Yet, the relative influence of pathogen transmission and resource allocation on immune function in bees from different stages has not been examined in the context of barrier immunity. We find that expression levels of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in honey bee barrier epithelia of the digestive tract do not follow a life stage-dependent decrease. In addition, correlation of AMP transcript abundance with microbe levels reveals a number of microbe-associated changes in AMPs levels that are equivalent between nurses and foragers. These results favor a model in which barrier effectors are maintained in foragers as a first line of defense, while systemic immune effectors are dismantled to optimize hive-level resources. These findings have important implications for our understanding of immunosenescence in honey bees and other social insects. © 2013 Jefferson et al.		polypeptide antibiotic agent, animal cell, animal tissue, arthropod life cycle stage, article, cell aging, cell surface, cellular immunity, controlled study, forager, honeybee, immune system, insect society, intestine epithelium cell, nonhuman, nurse, organism colony, population abundance, protein expression, Aging, Animals, Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides, Bees, Crithidia, Digestive System, Genes, Insect, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Immunity, Innate, Insect Proteins, Models, Animal, Signal Transduction, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hexapoda	2013-01-08
Bee Preference for Native versus Exotic Plants in Restored Agricultural Hedgerows	Habitat restoration to promote wild pollinator populations is becoming increasingly common in agricultural lands. Yet, little is known about how wild bees, globally the most important wild pollinators, use resources in restored habitats. We compared bee use of native and exotic plants in two types of restored native plant hedgerows: mature hedgerows (>10 years from establishment) designed for natural enemy enhancement and new hedgerows (≤2 years from establishment) designed to enhance bee populations. Bees were collected from flowers using timed aerial netting and flowering plant cover was estimated by species using cover classes. At mature hedgerow sites, wild bee abundance, richness, and diversity were greater on native plants than exotic plants. At new sites, where native plants were small and had limited floral display, abundance of bees was greater on native plants than exotic plants; but, controlling for floral cover, there was no difference in bee diversity and richness between the two plant types. At both mature and new hedgerows, wild bees preferred to forage from native plants than exotic plants. Honey bees, which were from managed colonies, also preferred native plants at mature hedgerow sites but exhibited no preference at new sites. Our study shows that wild bees, and managed bees in some cases, prefer to forage on native plants in hedgerows over co-occurring weedy, exotic plants. Semi-quantitative ranking identified which native plants were most preferred. Hedgerow restoration with native plants may help enhance wild bee abundance and diversity, and maintain honey bee health, in agricultural areas. © 2012 Society for Ecological Restoration.		bee, ecosystem service, habitat restoration, habitat selection, hedgerow, native species, plant, pollinator, restoration ecology, species diversity, species richness, wild population, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Magnoliophyta	2013-01-01
Dying Bees and the Social Production of Ignorance	This article utilizes the ongoing debates over the role of certain agricultural insecticides in causing Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD)-the phenomenon of accelerated bee die-offs in the United States and elsewhere-as an opportunity to contribute to the emerging literature on the social production of ignorance. In our effort to understand the social contexts that shape knowledge/nonknowledge production in this case, we develop the concept of epistemic form. Epistemic form is the suite of concepts, methods, measures, and interpretations that shapes the ways in which actors produce knowledge and ignorance in their professional/intellectual fields of practice. In the CCD controversy, we examine how the (historically influenced) privileging of certain epistemic forms intersects with the social dynamics of academic, regulatory, and corporate organizations to lead to the institutionalization of three interrelated and overlapping types of ignorance. We consider the effects of these types of ignorance on US regulatory policy and on the lives of different stakeholders. © The Author(s) 2012.			2013-01-01
Functional and evolutionary insights into the simple yet specific gut microbiota of the honey bee from metagenomic analysis	The honey bee, Apis mellifera, harbors a characteristic gut microbiota composed of only a few species which seem to be specific to social bees. The maintenance of this stable and distinct microbial community depends on the social lifestyle of these insects. As in other animals, the bacteria in the gut of honey bees probably govern important functions critical to host health. We recently sequenced a metagenome of the gut microbiota of A. mellifera, assigned gene contents to bins corresponding to the major species present in the honey bee gut, and compared functional gene categories between these species, and between the complete metagenome and those of other animals. Gene contents could be linked to different symbiotic functions with the host. Further, we found a high degree of genetic diversity within each of these species. In the case of the gammaproteobacterial species Gilliamella apicola, we experimentally showed a link between genetic variation of isolates and functional differences suggesting that niche partitioning within this species has emerged during evolution with its bee hosts. The consistent presence of only a few species, combined with strain variation within each of these species, makes the gut microbiota of social bees an ideal model for studying functional, structural, and evolutionary aspects of host-associated microbial communities: many characteristics resemble the gut microbiota of humans and other mammals, but the complexity is considerably reduced. In this addendum, we summarize and discuss our major findings and provide a detailed perspective on future research. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.		fructose, glucose, glycosidase, mannose, pectin, polysaccharide lyase, RNA 16S, sucrose, Apis mellifera, article, biofilm, degradation, fluorescence microscopy, Gammaproteobacteria, gene function, gene sequence, genetic difference, genetic variability, histochemistry, host pathogen interaction, intestine flora, metagenomics, nonhuman, phylogeny, pollen, polymerase chain reaction, animal, bacterial phenomena and functions, bacterium, bee, biota, gastrointestinal tract, genetics, Gilliamella, gut microbiome, insect, metagenome, microbiology, review, Snodgrassella, symbiont, symbiosis, Animalia, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hexapoda, Mammalia, Gilliamella, gut microbiome, insects, pectin, Snodgrassella, symbionts, Animals, Bacteria, Bacterial Physiological Phenomena, Bees, Biota, Gastrointestinal Tract, Metagenome, Symbiosis	2013-01-01

First isolation of a marseillevirus in the diptera syrphidae eristalis tenax	Objective: Giant viruses and amoebae are common in freshwater, where they can coexist with various insects. We screened insect larvae to detect giant viruses using a high-throughput method. Methods: We analyzed 86 Eristalis tenax larvae obtained from stagnant water reservoirs in Tunisia. The larvae were decontaminated and then dissected to remove internal parts for coculture with Acanthamoeba polyphaga. Genome sequencing of isolated viruses was performed on a 454 Roche instrument, and comparative genomics were performed. Results: One Marseillevirus, named Insectomime virus, was isolated. The genome assembly generated two scaffolds, which were 382,776 and 3,855 bp in length. Among the 477 identified predicted proteins, the best hit for 435 of the identified proteins was a Marseillevirus or Lausannevirus protein. Tunisvirus was the most closely related to Insectomime, with 446 orthologs. One Insectomime protein shared with Lausannevirus and Tunisvirus showed the highest similarity with a protein from an aphid. Conclusion: The isolation of a Marseillevirus from an insect expands the diversity of environments in which giant viruses have been isolated. The coexistence of larvae and giant viruses in stagnant water may explain the presence of the giant virus in the larva internal structures. This study illustrates the putative role of amoeba in lateral gene transfer not only between the organisms it phagocytoses, but also between organisms living in the same environment. © 2013 S.

Morphometrics and parasitic load of Varroa mites (acari: varroidae) on colonies of apis mellifera adansonii (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in South Western Nigeria	The parasitic mite Varroa destructor has been the dominant subject of discussion among bee scientists and beekeepers worldwide. Unfortunately, few literatures has reported the presence of this dreaded honey bee parasites in Sub-Saharan Africa until 2012 when Nigeria was listed among impacted countries. In Sub-Saharan Africa, beekeeping activities have long been plagued with many problems such as low honey yield, frequent bee swarming and colony absconding. A three year field study was carried out to investigate the degree and pattern of infestation, the species and haplotypes of the Varroa mite parasitizing the bees A. m. adansonii in South Western Nigeria. Survey pathologies were carried out using alcohol wash method to dislodge mites from 42 colonies evenly sampled from 14 apiaries selected in Ogun, Osun and Lagos States. Thirty one colonies (73.8%) sampled were infested with Varroa mites, no significant difference were found between the levels of infestation during the dry and wet seasons at confidence interval of 95% (t = 1.542, df = 13, p = 0.147 (p> 0.05)). Average mite load on adult bees range from 0.01 to 0.10 mites per bee and mite load in colonies ranged from 4 to 55 mites per 100 bees. All the colonies can be rated as Varroa tolerant because infestation is not more than 0.15 mites per adult bee. Morphometric analysis of samples of the female mites from colonies in different locations showed there was no significant difference at 95% confidence intervals between the mean body lengths (t = 0.545, df = 19, p = 0.592 (p > 0.05)), mean body widths (t = 0.374, df = 19, p = 0.713 (p > 0.05)) and similarly, between the second and fourth leg segments of the mites. Comparing these morphometric data with the data base of other workers confirmed the only one species found in the area as Varroa destructor. Haplotype confirmation of the species further revealed the mites were the Korean haplotype “K’ type referred to as the virulent type. © Acarina 2013.			2013-01-01
Threats to an ecosystem service: Pressures on pollinators	Insect pollinators of crops and wild plants are under threat globally and their decline or loss could have profound economic and environmental consequences. Here, we argue that multiple anthropogenic pressures - including land-use intensification, climate change, and the spread of alien species and diseases - are primarily responsible for insect-pollinator declines. We show that a complex interplay between pressures (eg lack of food sources, diseases, and pesticides) and biological processes (eg species dispersal and interactions) at a range of scales (from genes to ecosystems) underpins the general decline in insect-pollinator populations. Interdisciplinary research on the nature and impacts of these interactions will be needed if human food security and ecosystem function are to be preserved. We highlight key areas that require research focus and outline some practical steps to alleviate the pressures on pollinators and the pollination services they deliver to wild and crop plants. © The Ecological Society of America.		anthropogenic effect, climate change, crop plant, disease spread, economic impact, ecosystem function, ecosystem service, food security, insect, interdisciplinary approach, invasive species, land use change, pollination, pollinator, wild population, Hexapoda	2013-01-01
Pathogens, pests, and economics: Drivers of honey bee colony declines and losses	The Western honey bee (Apis mellifera) is responsible for ecosystem services (pollination) worth US$215 billion annually worldwide and the number of managed colonies has increased 45% since 1961. However, in Europe and the U.S., two distinct phenomena; long-term declines in colony numbers and increasing annual colony losses, have led to significant interest in their causes and environmental implications. The most important drivers of a long-term decline in colony numbers appear to be socioeconomic and political pressure on honey production. In contrast, annual colony losses seem to be driven mainly by the spread of introduced pathogens and pests, and management problems due to a long-term intensification of production and the transition from large numbers of small apiaries to fewer, larger operations. We conclude that, while other causal hypotheses have received substantial interest, the role of pests, pathogens, and management issues requires increased attention. © 2013 International Association for Ecology and Health.

UHPLC-DAD method for the determination of neonicotinoid insecticides in single bees and its relevance in honeybee colony loss investigations	In the understanding of colony loss phenomena, a worldwide crisis of honeybee colonies which has serious consequences for both apiculture and bee-pollination-dependent farm production, analytical chemistry can play an important role. For instance, rapid and accurate analytical procedures are currently required to better assess the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on honeybee health. Since their introduction in agriculture, neonicotinoid insecticides have been blamed for being highly toxic to honeybees, possibly at the nanogram per bee level or lower. As a consequence, most of the analytical methods recently optimized have focused on the analysis of ultratraces of neonicotinoids using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques to study the effects of sublethal doses. However, recent evidences on two novel routes-seedling guttations and seed coating particulate, both associated with corn crops-that may expose honeybees to huge amounts of neonicotinoids in the field, with instantly lethal effects, suggest that selected procedures need optimizing. In the present work, a simplified ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-diode-array detection method for the determination of neonicotinoids in single bees has been optimized and validated. The method ensures good selectivity, good accuracy, and adequate detection limits, which make it suitable for the purpose, while maintaining its ability to evaluate exposure variability of individual bees. It has been successfully applied to the analysis of bees in free flight over an experimental sowing field, with the bees therefore being exposed to seed coating particulate released by the pneumatic drilling machine. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

Immune-related gene expression in nurse honey bees (Apis mellifera) exposed to synthetic acaricides	The mite Varroa destructor is an ectoparasite affecting honey bees worldwide. Synthetic acaricides have been among the principal tools available to beekeepers for its control, although several studies have shown its negative effects on honey bee physiology. Recent research suggests that those molecules strongly impact on immune signaling cascades and cellular immunity. In the present work, LC50 in six-day-old bees were determined for the following acaricides: tau-fluvalinate, flumethrin, amitraz and coumaphos. According to this obtained value, a group of individuals was treated with each acaricide and then processed for qPCR analysis. Transcript levels for genes encoding antimicrobial peptides and immune-related proteins were assessed. Flumethrin increased the expression of hymenoptaecin when comparing treated and control bees. Significant differences were recorded between coumaphos and flumethrin treatments, while the first one reduced the expression of hymenoptaecin and abaecin, the last one up-regulated their expressions. No significant statistically changes were recorded in the expression levels of vitellogenin, lysozyme or glucose dehydrogenase among bees treated with acaricides and control bees.

New insights on the genetic diversity of the honeybee parasite Nosema ceranae based on multilocus sequence analysis	The microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae is a common pathogen of the Western honeybee (Apis mellifera) whose variable virulence could be related to its genetic polymorphism and/or its polyphenism responding to environmental cues. Since the genotyping of N. ceranae based on unique marker sequences had been unsuccessful, we tested whether a multilocus approach, assessing the diversity of ten genetic markers - encoding nine proteins and the small ribosomal RNA subunit - allowed the discrimination between N. ceranae variants isolated from single A. mellifera individuals in four distant locations. High nucleotide diversity and allele content were observed for all genes. Most importantly, the diversity was mainly present within parasite populations isolated from single honeybee individuals. In contrast the absence of isolate differentiation precluded any taxa discrimination, even through a multilocus approach, but suggested that similar populations of parasites seem to infect honeybees in distant locations. As statistical evolutionary analyses showed that the allele frequency is under selective pressure, we discuss the origin and consequences of N. ceranae heterozygosity in a single host and lack of population divergence in the context of the parasite natural and evolutionary history.

A potential link among biogenic amines-based pesticides, learning and memory, and colony collapse disorder: A unique hypothesis	Pesticides are substances that have been widely used throughout the world to kill, repel, or control organisms such as certain forms of plants or animals considered as pests. Depending on their type, dose, and persistence in the environment, they can have impact even on non-target species such as beneficial insects (honeybees) in different ways, including reduction in their survival rate and interference with their reproduction process. Honeybee Apis mellifera is a major pollinator and has substantial economical and ecological values. Colony collapse disorder (CCD) is a mysterious phenomenon in which adult honeybee workers suddenly abandon from their hives, leaving behind food, brood, and queen. It is lately drawing a lot of attention due to pollination crisis as well as global agriculture and medical demands. If the problem of CCD is not resolved soon enough, this could have a major impact on food industry affecting world's economy a big time. Causes of CCD are not known. In this overview, I discuss CCD, biogenic amines-based-pesticides (neonicotinoids and formamidines), and their disruptive effects on biogenic amine signaling causing olfactory dysfunction in honeybees. According to my hypothesis, chronic exposure of biogenic amines-based-pesticides to honeybee foragers in hives and agricultural fields can disrupt neural cholinergic and octopaminergic signaling. Abnormality in biogenic amines-mediated neuronal signaling impairs their olfactory learning and memory, therefore foragers do not return to their hive-a possible cause of CCD. This overview is an attempt to discuss a hypothetical link among biogenic amines-based pesticides, olfactory learning and memory, and CCD. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Microsporidia and ‘The Art of Living Together’	Parasitism, aptly defined as one of the ‘living-together’ strategies (Trager, 1986), presents a dynamic system in which the parasite and its host are under evolutionary pressure to evolve new and specific adaptations, thus enabling the coexistence of the two closely interacting partners. Microsporidia are very frequently encountered obligatory intracellular protistan parasites that can infect both animals and some protists and are a consummate example of various aspects of the ‘living-together’ strategy. Microsporidia, relatives of fungi in the superkingdom Opisthokonta, belong to the relatively small group of parasites for which the host cell cytoplasm is the site of both reproduction and maturation. The structural and physiological reduction of their vegetative stage, together with the manipulation of host cell physiology, enables microsporidia to live in the cytosolic environment for most of their life cycle in a way resembling endocytobionts. The ability to form structurally complex spores and the invention and assembly of a unique injection mechanism enable microsporidia to disperse within host tissues and between host organisms, resulting in long-lasting infections. Microsporidia have adapted their genomes to the intracellular way of life, evolved strategies how to obtain nutrients directly from the host and how to manipulate not only the infected cells, but also the hosts themselves. The enormous variability of host organisms and their tissues provide microsporidian parasites a virtually limitless terrain for diversification and ecological expansion.

Comparative toxicity of acaricides to honey bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) workers and queens	Acaricides are used to treat honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies to control the varroa mite (Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman), a worldwide threat to honey bee health. Although acaricides control a serious honey bee parasite and mitigate bee loss, they may cause harm to bees as well. We topically applied five acaricides, each with a different mode of action, to young adult queen and worker bees to generate dose-response curves and LD50. Twenty-four hours after treatment, queens were found to be three-times more tolerant of tau-fluvalinate and six-times more tolerant of thymol than workers when adjusted for body weight differences between workers (108 mg) and queens (180 mg). Queens survived the highest administered doses of fenpyroximate (1620 μg/g) and coumaphos (2700 μg/g) indicating that queens are at least 11-fold more tolerant of coumaphos and at least 54-fold more tolerant of fenpyroximate than workers. However, queens treated with as little as 54 μg/g of fenpyroximate exhibited reduced survival over 6 wk after treatment. Amitraz was the only acaricide tested for which queens were not more tolerant than workers. The striking difference in acaricide tolerance of queen and worker honey bees suggests physiological differences in how the two castes are affected by xenobiotics. © 2012 Entomological Society of America.		acaricide, animal, article, bee, comparative study, drug effect, female, LD 50, longevity, Acaricides, Animals, Bees, Female, Lethal Dose 50, Longevity, Acari, Apidae, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hymenoptera, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2012-12-01
How does the mite Varroa destructor kill the honeybee Apis mellifera? Alteration of cuticular hydrcarbons and water loss in infested honeybees	Several factors threaten the health of honeybees; among them the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and the Deformed Wing Virus play a major role. Recently, the dangerous interplay between the mite and the virus was studied in detail and the transition, triggered by mite feeding, from a benign covert infection to a devastating viral outbreak, characterized by an intense viral replication, associated with some characteristic symptoms, was described. In order to gain insight into the events preceding that crucial transition we carried out standardized lab experiments aiming at studying the effects of parasitization in asymptomatic bees to establish a relationship between such effects and bee mortality. It appears that parasitization alters the capacity of the honeybee to regulate water exchange; this, in turn, has severe effects on bee survival. These results are discussed in light of possible novel strategies aiming at mitigating the impact of the parasite on honeybee health. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.		hydrocarbon, water, cuticle, feeding, honeybee, hydrocarbon, mite, mortality, parasitism, survival, symptom, viral disease, water exchange, animal, animal disease, article, bee, body weight, female, forelimb, host parasite interaction, humidity, insect virus, metabolism, mortality, parasitology, pathogenicity, pathology, physiology, Varroidae, virology, virus infection, Animals, Bees, Body Weight, Female, Host-Parasite Interactions, Humidity, Hydrocarbons, Insect Viruses, Varroidae, Virus Diseases, Water, Wing, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Deformed wing virus, Varroa destructor	2012-12-01
The effect of using prebiotic and probiotic products on intestinal micro-flora of the honeybee (Apis mellifera carpatica)	Maintaining bee colonies in a healthy state throughout the year is one of the main concerns of apiculture researchers. The phenomenon of disappearance of bee colonies is determined by several factors, one of which is bee disease. Due to the organizational structure of the bee colony, disease transmission is rapid, especially through infected food or via the nurse worker bees that feed the brood bees of the colony concerned. The practice of stimulating the bee colonies in spring using sugar syrup feeds with added prebiotic products (lactic acid or acetic acid) and probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-14 and Bifidobacterium lactis BI-04) by using an Enterobiotic product (Lactobacillus casei), marketed as Enterolactis Plus, for three weeks, resulted in a significant reduction of the total number of bacteria in the digestive tracts of the bees, compared with the control group. By contrast, intestinal colonization with beneficial bacteria contained in probiotics products administered to the bees was observed. This resulted in an improved health status and bio productive index of the bee colonies studied. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.		acetic acid, lactic acid, prebiotic agent, probiotic agent, apiculture, bacterial disease, colony, health status, honeybee, infectious disease, probiotics, animal, apiculture, article, bee, Bifidobacterium, gastrointestinal tract, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, microbiology, Acetic Acid, Animals, Beekeeping, Bees, Bifidobacterium, Gastrointestinal Tract, Lactic Acid, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Prebiotics, Probiotics, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Bacteria (microorganisms), Bifidobacterium animalis, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei	2012-12-01
Landscape analysis of drone congregation areas of the honey bee, apis mellifera	Male honey bees fly and gather at Drone Congregation Areas (DCAs), where drones and queens mate in flight. DCAs occur in places with presumably characteristic features. Using previously described landscape characteristics and observations on flight direction of drones in nearby apiaries, 36 candidate locations were chosen across the main island of Puerto Rico. At these locations, the presence or absence of DCAs was tested by lifting a helium balloon equipped with queen-sex-pheromone-impregnated bait, and visually determining the presence of high numbers of drones. Because of the wide distribution of honey bees in Puerto Rico, it was expected that most of the potential DCAs would be used as such by drones and queens from nearby colonies. Eight DCAs were found in the 36 candidate locations. Locations with and without DCAs were compared in a landscape analysis including characteristics that were described to be associated with DCAs and others. Aspect (direction of slope) and density of trails were found to be significantly associated with the presence of DCAs.		animal, apiculture, article, bee, environment, male, movement (physiology), physiology, Puerto Rico, social behavior, Animals, Beekeeping, Bees, Environment, Male, Movement, Puerto Rico, Social Behavior	2012-12-01
Analysis of mortality in africanized honey bee colonies with high levels of infestation Varroa destructor	The mite Varroa destructor (Anderson & Treuman 2000) is one of the world's most important plagues of apiculture. In Brazil this mite does not encounter good conditions for parasitism because weather conditions are not ideal for its maintenance, and some strains of Africanized honey bees are resistant to the parasite. This status is reflected in the low number of dead colonies caused by varroatosis and also the stability of infestation levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the damage caused by mite infestations in hives with higher levels of infestation than the ones considered normal for Brazilian apiaries. The level of infestation in each colony was determined and the mortality rates of parasitized bees during development were periodically recorded. The G Test of Independence and a Test of Proportions were used to compare the data. The rates of mortality of pupae and larvae were mostly proportional to the level of infestation in each colony. All colonies showed mortality rates significantly higher than the control one. In Africanized honeybee colonies with high rates of infestation by Varroa destructor mortality rates varied from 19.27% to 23.28% in pupae ( X = 21.27%) and from 15.71% to 16.15% in larvae {X = 15.93%), against 3.85% and 3.74% in the control colony, respectively. In the parasitized colonies the average rates of mortality caused by the hurtful effects of the mite were, respectively, 5.52 and 4.26 times greater in those two developmental stages. Thus it can be concluded that even in tropical regions, like Brazil, it is necessary to give special attention to the levels of mite infestation (IR), particularly where the IR tends to be higher.			2012-12-01
Factors limiting the growth of Varroa destructor populations in selected honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) Colonies	The objective of this study was to compare the hygienic behavior of worker bees (Apis mellifera) as well as infestation and reproduction parameters of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor between groups of honey bee colonies with high and low rates of Varroa population growth. More than 150 colonies were screened for mite fall in early spring and again 16 weeks later. The 10 colonies with the Lowest rates (L) and the 10 colonies with the Highest rates (H) of mite population growth were selected. These 20 colonies were evaluated for hygienic behavior, brood and adult bee infestation rates and mite reproduction in cells. The amount of brood and the adult bee population of the selected colonies were also estimated. No differences were found between the two groups of colonies for brood or adult bee population or for hygienic behavior. However, significant differences were detected for mite infestation levels and for mite reproduction. Brood and adult bee infestation rates in the colonies of the H group were 17 and 6 times higher, respectively than in the colonies of the L group. The proportion of reproductive mites was 0.92±0.05 in the H colonies vs. only 0.40±0.16 in the L colonies. Additionally, two times more immature mites were found in singly Varroa-infested cells of H colonies than in similarly infested cells of L colonies. Furthermore, the ratio of brood to adult bee infestation rate was 2.4 times greater for the H colonies in comparison with that of the L colonies. These results indicate that brood-associated effects may influence the growth of varroa mite populations in honey bee colonies. The implications of these results are discussed. © Medwell Journals, 2012.			2012-12-01
Residues of neonicotinoid insecticides in bee collected plant materials from oilseed rape crops and their effect on bee colonies	The risk exposure of bee colonies to the toxicity of systemic neonicotinoid insecticides was assessed. Various methods of chemical prevention of commercial winter and spring oilseed rape crops in field-realistic conditions were taken into account in the assessment. Pesticides were applied in accordance with the actual agricultural practice. Commercial crop protection products with thiamethoxam, clothianidin or imidacloprid were used as seed treatment. Formulations containing acetamiprid or thiacloprid were used for spraying. Fifteen healthy bee colonies were placed in close proximity to each of the oilseed rape fields throughout the blooming period. During florescence, the samples of nectar (directly from flowers and nectar flow from combs) and pollen loads were collected repeatedly. Samples of honey, bee bread and adult bees were taken one week after the end of plants flowering. To ensure high specificity and sensitivity of analysed pestcicides modified QuEChERS extraction method and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used. The five of neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiametoxam, acetamiprid and thiacloprid) were analyzed in multi-residue method with 0.1 - 10 ng/g limits of detection. Palynological analysis was done to determine the botanical origin of the nectar, honey and pollen. Development of bee colonies (brood area, worker biomass, colony health) was assessed every 3 weeks until the end of the beekeeping season. The amount of pollen collected by bees per hive, bee bread area and rape honey yield was also measured. The long-term effects of insecticides on bees were estimated using the same methods in April of the following year. All the neonicotinoid insecticides applied to control oilseed rape pests were present in the samples of nectar and pollen. Their residue levels were lower than the acute oral and contact LD50 values. Among five examined neonicotinoids, the most frequently detected were: thiamethoxam, thiacloprid and acetamiprid. These substances were present in 65, 64, and 51% of the nectar samples and in 37, 62, and 45% of the pollen samples, respectively. The highest level of residues were noted after the thiamethoxam seed treatment; on average, 4.2 and 3.8 ng/g in the nectar and pollen samples. In the nectar and pollen samples from winter rape fields, lower levels of neonicotinoid residues were found in comparison to spring rape samples. The contaminations of neonicotinoids applied as seed dressing in nectar samples were significantly higher in comparison to the pollen samples. No negative effects of neonicotinoids on the bee mortality, brood development, strength, and honey yield of healthy bee colonies were found throughout the study period. However, the risk exposure of bee colonies on adverse impact of pesticide residues is high in areas of intensively cultivated oilseed rape.			2012-12-01
Why massive honeybee colony losses do not occur in Uruguay?	In recent years massive honeybee colony losses have been reported mainly in the north hemisphere, including North America and several European countries. Scientists and beekeepers from all over the world are working to elucidate the causes of this phenomenon. Among different factors potential involved, the presence of different pathogens such as the mite Varroa destructor, the microsporidium Nosema ceranae and the presence of different RNA viruses may have a role in honeybee losses. It has been proposed that these events cannot be due to a single factor and a combination of causes should be considered. In Uruguay (South America) there are about 4,000 beekeepers and more than 400,000 beehives. The most important pathogens of honeybees are present and widely distributed in the country. V. destructor is found along the country, but their virulence varies from region to region. Almost every beekeeper applies acaricides on the end of the summer or the beginning of the fall, owing to avoid colony loses. The acaricides fluvalinate, flumetrin, amitraz and coumaphos are very efficient, except for some regions where resistant mites to some of these molecules have been detected. N. ceranae is present in Uruguay before 1990 and nowadays is the main species detected of Nosema spp.. However, there have not been reports of colony loses whose cause was without doubts nosemosis. This is confirmed by thousands of colonies that are moved to Eucalyptus grandis plantations in the north of the country at the end of the summer, where every colony suffers severe infections with Nosema spp. and even in that way, reach the following spring without difficulties. On the other side, the presence of acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV), black queen cell virus (BQCV), sacbrood virus (SBV) and deformed wing virus (DWV) have been detected in Uruguay since 2005. Their detection in different geographic regions, the simultaneous co-infection of colonies by several viruses, the high prevalence found in the country and a high incidence in different seasons indicates that they are widely spread. Interestingly, the seasonal incidence of DWV around the year was similar to the incidence of V. destructor, according with previous reports. Kashmir virus and Israeli Acute paralysis virus, other honeybee viruses potentially related to honeybee looses have not been detected so far. The presence and co-existence of these pathogens are maybe involved in the reduction of colonies production detected during the last years. However, massive honeybee looses have not been reported. In the present chapter we present in detail the sanitary situation of Uruguay focussed on the presence of V. destructor, N. ceranae and RNA viruses and their prevalence and coexistence along the year, and discuss possible reasons why honeybee looses episodes have not been detected. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.			2012-12-01
Effects of neonicotinoid dust from maize seed-dressing on honey bees	In Northern Italy from 2000 to 2008, many spring bee mortalities were clearly linked to sowing of maize seeds dressed with insecticides. In the present study, we investigated the effects on honey bees of clothianidin derived from maize seed-dressing (Poncho®) in laboratory (test by indirect contact) and in semi-field conditions. Despite the reduction of dust dispersion due to the application of the best available sowing techniques (pneumatic seeder equipped with deflector, improvement of seed-dressing quality) our results showed negative effects on honey bees at individual level. In semi-field study, no effect was observed at the colony level despite the high bee mortality rate for 2-3 days after dust application. However, we can expect a colony decline and low honey production if this high forager mortality rate lasts for longer than 10 days. Such a situation is possible if the sowing period lasts several days as in the Po Valley, where the landscape is characterized by extended maize cultivation. Specific methodologies to assess the effects of dust have never been included in the official guidelines for the evaluation of side-effects of plant protection products on honey bees. For this reason, suitable and standardized methods for testing in laboratory and in semi-field conditions the effects on honey bees of contaminated dust dispersed during sowing were evaluated.

Antibiotic, pesticide, and microbial contaminants of honey: Human health hazards	Agricultural contamination with pesticides and antibiotics is a challenging problem that needs to be fully addressed. Bee products, such as honey, are widely consumed as food and medicine and their contamination may carry serious health hazards. Honey and other bee products are polluted by pesticides, heavy metals, bacteria and radioactive materials. Pesticide residues cause genetic mutations and cellular degradation and presence of antibiotics might increase resistant human or animal's pathogens. Many cases of infant botulisms have been attributed to contaminated honey. Honey may be very toxic when produced from certain plants. Ingestion of honey without knowing its source and safety might be problematic. Honey should be labeled to explore its origin, composition, and clear statement that it is free from contaminants. Honey that is not subjected for analysis and sterilization should not be used in infants, and should not be applied to wounds or used for medicinal purposes. This article reviews the extent and health impact of honey contamination and stresses on the introduction of a strict monitoring system and validation of acceptable minimal concentrations of pollutants or identifying maximum residue limits for bee products, in particular, honey. © 2012 Noori Al-Waili et al.		1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene, aldrin, amitraz, antibiotic agent, atropine, bromopropylate, campheclor, chloramphenicol, chlorphenotane, coumafos, doxycycline, endrin, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, fluvalinate, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, lincomycin, mirex, monensin, oxytetracycline, pesticide, streptomycin, antiinfective agent, pesticide, antibiotic resistance, Clostridium botulinum, coma, food contamination, gas chromatography, health hazard, hematologic disease, honey, honeybee, intoxication, mad honey intoxication, microbial contamination, nonhuman, pollinator, review, skin irritation, apiculture, environmental monitoring, food contamination, food control, honey, human, maximum allowable concentration, microbiology, Animalia, Apoidea, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Beekeeping, Environmental Monitoring, Food Contamination, Food Microbiology, Honey, Humans, Maximum Allowable Concentration, Pesticides	2012-11-19
Pyrosequencing analysis of the bacterial communities in the guts of honey bees Apis cerana and Apis mellifera in Korea	The bacterial communities in the guts of the adults and larvae of the Asian honey bee Apis cerana and the European honey bee Apis mellifera were surveyed by pyrosequencing the 16S rRNA genes. Most of the gut bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were highly similar to the known honey bee-specific ones and affiliated with Pasteurellaceae or lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The numbers of operational taxonomic units (OTUs, defined at 97% similarity) were lower in the larval guts (6 or 9) than in the adult guts (18 or 20), and the frequencies of Pasteurellaceae-related OTUs were higher in the larval guts while those of LAB-related OTUs in the adult guts. The frequencies of Lactococcus, Bartonella, Spiroplasma, Enterobacteriaceae, and Flavobacteriaceae-related OTUs were much higher in A. cerana guts while Bifidobacterium and Lachnospiraceae-related OTUs were more abundant in A. mellfera guts. The bacterial community structures in the midguts and hindguts of the adult honey bees were not different for A. cerana, but significantly different for A. mellifera. The above results substantiated the previous observation that honey bee guts are dominated by several specific bacterial groups, and also showed that the relative abundances of OTUs could be markedly changed depending on the developmental stage, the location within the gut, and the honey bee species. The possibility of using the gut bacterial community as an indicator of honey bee health was discussed. © 2012 The Microbiological Society of Korea and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.		bacterial DNA, RNA 16S, animal, article, bacterium, bee, classification, gastrointestinal tract, genetics, high throughput screening, isolation and purification, microbiology, molecular genetics, phylogeny, Animals, Bacteria, Bees, DNA, Bacterial, Gastrointestinal Tract, High-Throughput Screening Assays, Molecular Sequence Data, Phylogeny, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Apis cerana, Apis mellifera, Bacteria (microorganisms), Bartonella, Bifidobacterium, Enterobacteriaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Lactococcus, Otus, Pasteurellaceae, Spiroplasma	2012-11-12
Fine-Scale Linkage Mapping Reveals a Small Set of Candidate Genes Influencing Honey Bee Grooming Behavior in Response to Varroa Mites	Populations of honey bees in North America have been experiencing high annual colony mortality for 15-20 years. Many apicultural researchers believe that introduced parasites called Varroa mites (V. destructor) are the most important factor in colony deaths. One important resistance mechanism that limits mite population growth in colonies is the ability of some lines of honey bees to groom mites from their bodies. To search for genes influencing this trait, we used an Illumina Bead Station genotyping array to determine the genotypes of several hundred worker bees at over a thousand single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a family that was apparently segregating for alleles influencing this behavior. Linkage analyses provided a genetic map with 1,313 markers anchored to genome sequence. Genotypes were analyzed for association with grooming behavior, measured as the time that individual bees took to initiate grooming after mites were placed on their thoraces. Quantitative-trait-locus interval mapping identified a single chromosomal region that was significant at the chromosome-wide level (p<0.05) on chromosome 5 with a LOD score of 2.72. The 95% confidence interval for quantitative trait locus location contained only 27 genes (honey bee official gene annotation set 2) including Atlastin, Ataxin and Neurexin-1 (AmNrx1), which have potential neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects. Atlastin and Ataxin homologs are associated with neurological diseases in humans. AmNrx1 codes for a presynaptic protein with many alternatively spliced isoforms. Neurexin-1 influences the growth, maintenance and maturation of synapses in the brain, as well as the type of receptors most prominent within synapses. Neurexin-1 has also been associated with autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia in humans, and self-grooming behavior in mice. © 2012 Arechavaleta-Velasco et al.		neurexin, animal behavior, animal experiment, animal genetics, article, Ataxin gene, Atlastin gene, chromosome 5, gene, gene identification, gene location, genetic association, genetic trait, genotype, grooming, honeybee, linkage analysis, Neurexin 1 gene, nonhuman, quantitative trait locus mapping, single nucleotide polymorphism, Varroa, Alleles, Alternative Splicing, Animals, Bees, Chromosome Mapping, Computational Biology, Expressed Sequence Tags, Female, Genetic Linkage, Genotype, Lod Score, Mites, Models, Genetic, Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Protein Isoforms, Quantitative Trait Loci, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Mus, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2012-11-02
High-Resolution Linkage Analyses to Identify Genes That Influence Varroa Sensitive Hygiene Behavior in Honey Bees	Varroa mites (V. destructor) are a major threat to honey bees (Apis melilfera) and beekeeping worldwide and likely lead to colony decline if colonies are not treated. Most treatments involve chemical control of the mites; however, Varroa has evolved resistance to many of these miticides, leaving beekeepers with a limited number of alternatives. A non-chemical control method is highly desirable for numerous reasons including lack of chemical residues and decreased likelihood of resistance. Varroa sensitive hygiene behavior is one of two behaviors identified that are most important for controlling the growth of Varroa populations in bee hives. To identify genes influencing this trait, a study was conducted to map quantitative trait loci (QTL). Individual workers of a backcross family were observed and evaluated for their VSH behavior in a mite-infested observation hive. Bees that uncapped or removed pupae were identified. The genotypes for 1,340 informative single nucleotide polymorphisms were used to construct a high-resolution genetic map and interval mapping was used to analyze the association of the genotypes with the performance of Varroa sensitive hygiene. We identified one major QTL on chromosome 9 (LOD score = 3.21) and a suggestive QTL on chromosome 1 (LOD = 1.95). The QTL confidence interval on chromosome 9 contains the gene 'no receptor potential A' and a dopamine receptor. 'No receptor potential A' is involved in vision and olfaction in Drosophila, and dopamine signaling has been previously shown to be required for aversive olfactory learning in honey bees, which is probably necessary for identifying mites within brood cells. Further studies on these candidate genes may allow for breeding bees with this trait using marker-assisted selection.		dopamine receptor, animal behavior, animal experiment, Apis mellifera, article, backcrossing, chromosome 1, chromosome 9, gene identification, genetic association, genetic trait, genotype, homozygote, insect chromosome, insect genetics, linkage analysis, nonhuman, phenotype, pupa (life cycle stage), quantitative trait locus mapping, queen (insect), single nucleotide polymorphism, Varroa sensitive hygiene, worker (insect), Animals, Beekeeping, Bees, Behavior, Animal, Chromosome Mapping, Dopamine, Drosophila, Female, Genetic Linkage, Genotype, Host-Parasite Interactions, Lod Score, Male, Mite Infestations, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Quantitative Trait Loci, Varroidae, Acari, Apis, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2012-11-02
The effects of beta acids from hops (Humulus lupulus) on mortality of Varroa destructor (Acari: Varroidae)	Hop (Humulus lupulus L.) beta acids (HBA) were tested for miticidal effects on varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman, a parasitic mite of the honey bee (Apismellifera L.). When varroa were placed on bees that had topical applications of 1 % HBA, there was 100 % mite mortality. Bee mortality was unaffected. Cardboard strips saturated with HBA and placed in colonies resulted in mite drop that was significantly greater than in untreated hives. HBA was detected on about 60 % of the bees in colonies during the first 48 h after application. Mite drop in colonies lasted for about 7 days with the highest drop occurring in the first 2-3 days after treatment. There was a reduction in the percentages of bees with HBA and in the amounts on their bodies after 7 days. Bee and queen mortality in the colonies were not affected by HBA treatments. When cardboard strips saturated with HBA were put in packages of bees, more than 90 % of the mites were killed without an increase in bee mortality. HBA might have potential to control varroa when establishing colonies from packages or during broodless periods. © 2012 The Author(s).		acaricide, lupulon, terpene, biocontrol agent, biological control, colony, honeybee, mite, mortality, organic acid, animal, article, bee, chemistry, drug effect, Humulus, isolation and purification, parasitology, Varroidae, Acaricides, Animals, Bees, Humulus, Terpenes, Varroidae, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Humulus, Humulus lupulus, Varroa, Varroa destructor, Varroidae	2012-11-01
Combined pesticide exposure severely affects individual-and colony-level traits in bees	Reported widespread declines of wild and managed insect pollinators have serious consequences for global ecosystem services and agricultural production. Bees contribute approximately 80% of insect pollination, so it is important to understand and mitigate the causes of current declines in bee populations. Recent studies have implicated the role of pesticides in these declines, as exposure to these chemicals has been associated with changes in bee behaviour and reductions in colony queen production. However, the key link between changes in individual behaviour and the consequent impact at the colony level has not been shown. Social bee colonies depend on the collective performance of many individual workers. Thus, although field-level pesticide concentrations can have subtle or sublethal effects at the individual level, it is not known whether bee societies can buffer such effects or whether it results in a severe cumulative effect at the colony level. Furthermore, widespread agricultural intensification means that bees are exposed to numerous pesticides when foraging, yet the possible combinatorial effects of pesticide exposure have rarely been investigated. Here we show that chronic exposure of bumblebees to two pesticides (neonicotinoid and pyrethroid) at concentrations that could approximate field-level exposure impairs natural foraging behaviour and increases worker mortality leading to significant reductions in brood development and colony success. We found that worker foraging performance, particularly pollen collecting efficiency, was significantly reduced with observed knock-on effects for forager recruitment, worker losses and overall worker productivity. Moreover, we provide evidence that combinatorial exposure to pesticides increases the propensity of colonies to fail. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Gentle africanized bees on an oceanic island	Oceanic islands have reduced resources and natural enemies and potentially affect life history traits of arriving organisms. Among the most spectacular invasions in the Western hemisphere is that of the Africanized honeybee. We hypothesized that in the oceanic island Puerto Rico, Africanized bees will exhibit differences from the mainland population such as for defensiveness and other linked traits. We evaluated the extent of Africanization through three typical Africanized traits: wing size, defensive behavior, and resistance to Varroa destructor mites. All sampled colonies were Africanized by maternal descent, with over 65% presence of European alleles at the S-3 nuclear locus. In two assays evaluating defense, Puerto Rican bees showed low defensiveness similar to European bees. In morphology and resistance to mites, Africanized bees from Puerto Rico are similar to other Africanized bees. In behavioral assays on mechanisms of resistance to Varroa, we directly observed that Puerto Rican Africanized bees groomed-off and bit the mites as been observed in other studies. In no other location, Africanized bees have reduced defensiveness while retaining typical traits such as wing size and mite resistance. This mosaic of traits that has resulted during the invasion of an oceanic island has implications for behavior, evolution, and agriculture. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.			2012-11-01
BeeDoctor, a Versatile MLPA-Based Diagnostic Tool for Screening Bee Viruses	The long-term decline of managed honeybee hives in the world has drawn significant attention to the scientific community and bee-keeping industry. A high pathogen load is believed to play a crucial role in this phenomenon, with the bee viruses being key players. Most of the currently characterized honeybee viruses (around twenty) are positive stranded RNA viruses. Techniques based on RNA signatures are widely used to determine the viral load in honeybee colonies. High throughput screening for viral loads necessitates the development of a multiplex polymerase chain reaction approach in which different viruses can be targeted simultaneously. A new multiparameter assay, called "BeeDoctor", was developed based on multiplex-ligation probe dependent amplification (MLPA) technology. This assay detects 10 honeybee viruses in one reaction. "BeeDoctor" is also able to screen selectively for either the positive strand of the targeted RNA bee viruses or the negative strand, which is indicative for active viral replication. Due to its sensitivity and specificity, the MLPA assay is a useful tool for rapid diagnosis, pathogen characterization, and epidemiology of viruses in honeybee populations. "BeeDoctor" was used for screening 363 samples from apiaries located throughout Flanders; the northern half of Belgium. Using the "BeeDoctor", virus infections were detected in almost eighty percent of the colonies, with deformed wing virus by far the most frequently detected virus and multiple virus infections were found in 26 percent of the colonies. © 2012 De Smet et al.		article, Belgium, controlled study, honeybee, multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification, nonhuman, reverse transcription, reverse transcription multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification, RNA virus, sensitivity and specificity, virus detection, virus infection, virus replication, Animals, Bees, Insect Viruses, Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reproducibility of Results, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, RNA Viruses, RNA, Viral, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Deformed wing virus, RNA viruses	2012-10-29
Comparison of transcriptional changes of immune genes to experimental challenge in the honey bee (Apis mellifera)	Honey bee colony losses of the last decade have been alarming. Besides the most critical factors, such as parasites and pathogens, losses have been claimed to be linked to immunodeficiency. For the evaluation of this suggestion powerful immunological tests are required. The aim of this study was to obtain further data to characterize common markers of immunity with respect to their experimental practicability. Honey bees were challenged by mechanical and pathogen-like stressors. These were wounding and the injection of buffers and acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), lipopolysaccharides, lipoteichoic acid, Paenibacillus larvae suspensions and petidoglycan. All experiments were conducted with bees in hoarding cages at a laboratory scale. Immune reactions were quantified by inhibition zone assays and by expression analysis of the genes coding for abaecin, apidaecin, defensin1, hymenoptaecin, hopscotch, Toll and prophenoloxidase. Wounding and injections led to significant immune responses, but the addition of pathogen derived material to the injection solutions did not result in a prominent or specific increase of the defense reactions. A significant upregulation was found for abaecin, defensin1, apidaecin and hymenoptaecin, which was the most responsive gene, showing a 270-fold upregulation after P larvae injection. The upregulation of each of these effector genes was strongly correlated with each other and with Toll, but not with hopscotch or prophenoloxidase.			2012-10-01
Asymptomatic presence of Nosema spp. in Spanish commercial apiaries	Nosemosis is caused by intracellular parasites (Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae) that infect the midgut epithelial cells in adult honey bees. Recent studies relate N. ceranae to Colony Collapse Disorder and there is some suggestion that Nosema spp., especially N. ceranae, induces high mortality in honey bees, a fact that is considered as a serious threat for colony survival.604 samples of adult honey bees for Nosema spp. analysis were collected from beekeeping colonies across Spain and were analysed using PCR with capillary electrophoresis. We also monitored 77 Andalusian apiaries for 2. years; the sampled hives were standard healthy colonies, without any special disease symptoms. We found 100% presence of Nosema spp. in some locations, indicating that this parasite was widespread throughout the country. The two year monitoring indicated that 87% of the hives with Nosema spp. remained viable, with normal honey production and biological development during this period of time. The results of these trials indicated that both N. ceranae and N. apis could be present in these beehives without causing disease symptom and that there is no evidence for the replacement of N. apis by N. ceranae, supporting the hypothesis that nosemosis is not the main reason of the collapse and death of beehives. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.		animal, apiculture, article, bee, colony collapse, genetics, isolation and purification, microbiology, Nosema, physiology, Spain, Animals, Beekeeping, Bees, Colony Collapse, Nosema, Spain, Apis mellifera, Nosema, Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae	2012-10-01
Nutritional limitation and resistance to opportunistic Aspergillus parasites in honey bee larvae	Honey bees are threatened by land use changes which reduce the availability and diversity of pollen and nectar resources. There is concern that poor nutrition may be involved in recent population declines, either directly or due to indirect effects on immunocompetence. The larval stage is likely to be the most vulnerable to a poor diet, but the effects of larval nutrition on the disease susceptibility of bees are not well known. In this study we used laboratory-reared honey bee larvae to investigate the effects of diet quality on disease susceptibility to the opportunistic fungal parasites Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus phoenicis and A. fumigatus. Larvae fed on a nutritionally poor diet were found to be significantly more susceptible to A. fumigatus. Larval resistance to A. fumigatus was enhanced by feeding with a diet supplemented with either dandelion or polyfloral pollens. This indicates that dandelion and polyfloral pollens contain elements that enhance resistance to this fungal disease, illustrating an interaction between nutrition and parasitism and emphasising the benefit of diverse floral resources in the environment to maintain honey bee health. © 2012.		animal, article, Aspergillus, bee, larva, microbiology, parasitology, pollen, Animals, Aspergillus, Bees, Larva, Pollen, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Aspergillus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus phoenicis, Taraxacum officinale	2012-09-15
Challenges for developing pathogen-based biopesticides against Varroa destructor (Mesostigmata: Varroidae)	Control of the major pest of apiculture, the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor using pathogen-based biopesticides would resolve many of the problems experienced with other forms of control, such as chemical control, hive manipulation, or selection of resistant honeybee strains. Several research groups have developed and tested fungus-based biopesticides in laboratory and field experiments, with varying results. While biopesticides have many desirable qualities, including much lower risk of honey contamination and of pest resistance, future research needs to focus on: (1) identification of the sub-population(s) of V. destructor affected by biopesticides and the duration and impact of the application on mite population dynamics; (2) development of an effective, easily applied formulation, and (3) evaluation of possible side or sublethal effects on bees themselves. Biopesticides need to be evaluated on the field (colony) level in addition to the laboratory level. Researchers should consider providing data that can be easily used to evaluate effect, such as mite drop counts onto sticky boards coupled with assessments of phoretic mite density or brood cell mite density. Exploration for naturally occurring pathogens should be conducted in the native range of V. destructor in Asia. © 2012 INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag, France.		apiculture, biological control, biopesticide, chemical control, ectoparasite, entomopathogenic organism, fungus, honeybee, mite, pest resistance, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Fungi, Mesostigmata, Varroa destructor, Varroidae	2012-09-01
Pathogen webs in collapsing honey bee colonies	Recent losses in honey bee colonies are unusual in their severity, geographical distribution, and, in some cases, failure to present recognized characteristics of known disease. Domesticated honey bees face numerous pests and pathogens, tempting hypotheses that colony collapses arise from exposure to new or resurgent pathogens. Here we explore the incidence and abundance of currently known honey bee pathogens in colonies suffering from Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), otherwise weak colonies, and strong colonies from across the United States. Although pathogen identities differed between the eastern and western United States, there was a greater incidence and abundance of pathogens in CCD colonies. Pathogen loads were highly covariant in CCD but not control hives, suggesting that CCD colonies rapidly become susceptible to a diverse set of pathogens, or that co-infections can act synergistically to produce the rapid depletion of workers that characterizes the disorder. We also tested workers from a CCD-free apiary to confirm that significant positive correlations among pathogen loads can develop at the level of individual bees and not merely as a secondary effect of CCD. This observation and other recent data highlight pathogen interactions as important components of bee disease. Finally, we used deep RNA sequencing to further characterize microbial diversity in CCD and non-CCD hives. We identified novel strains of the recently described Lake Sinai viruses (LSV) and found evidence of a shift in gut bacterial composition that may be a biomarker of CCD. The results are discussed with respect to host-parasite interactions and other environmental stressors of honey bees.

The effects of land use on honey bee (Apis mellifera) population density and colony strength parameters in the Eastern Cape, South Africa	Livestock farming in the Eastern Cape, South Africa is a common land use practice that has affected the biodiversity of plants and animals in the region negatively. Indigenous populations of wild honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies also may suffer. Recently, farmers in the Eastern Cape have been converting their farms to game reserves as ecotourism attractions and nature conservation lands. Consequently, the goal of this research was to determine if land use habits (livestock farming and conversion to game reserves) in the Eastern Cape affect honey bee colony population density and colony strength parameters. A series of indices were developed to compare the relative population densities of colonies in two or more areas by counting the number of foraging bees and number of bee lines established at feeding stations. Wild colonies on farms and reserves were located and sampled to determine land use effects on colony strength parameters including total area of comb in the colony, the area of comb containing stored honey, pollen, and brood, adult bee population, weight per bee, and the colony nest cavity volume ratio. When viewed collectively, the data indicated that land use practices have affected honey bee nesting dynamics in the Eastern Cape. Trends in the data suggested that colonies nesting on the reserves may occur in greater densities than those nesting on livestock farms, though they do not appear to be healthier. Hopefully, this work will be continued since honey bee conservation in areas where they are native is crucial to the health of agriculture and whole ecosystems globally. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.		colony, ecological impact, ecosystem response, ecotourism, honeybee, land use, livestock farming, nature reserve, nesting behavior, population density, population ecology, species conservation, tourist attraction, Eastern Cape, South Africa, Animalia, Apis mellifera, Apis mellifera scutellata, Apoidea	2012-08-01
Nosema ceranae an emergent pathogen of Apis mellifera in Chile	The microsporidian Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae have been associated with colony disorders of Apis mellifera and Apis cerana, respectively. N. apis is endemic in South America. Recently, N. ceranae has been detected in Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. No report of its presence, distribution and prevalence in Chile is available. Here, we present a realtime PCR-based method that was able to discriminate between N. apis and N. ceranae. The dynamic range of this assay was 100 to 100,000 spores per honeybee. False-negative results were avoided due to the use of ACTIN gene as internal standard. False-positive results were obtained neither in experimentally nor in naturally contaminated samples. Using this method, we screened 240 beehives from the Chilean region where 42% of the total country honey production take places (Región del Biobío). Nosema spp. were detected in the four provinces and in 20 of the 26 communes of the region. Among the samples analysed, 49% were positive for N. ceranae. Their infection level ranged from 200 to more than 100,000 spores per honeybee. N. apis was not detected in this region. Hence, our data show that in Chile N. ceranae is an emergent pathogen that is been replacing N. apis. Also, they support that N. ceranae maybe the actual responsible for nosemosis in A. mellifera in South America. © Springer-Verlag 2012.		actin gene, article, Chile, controlled study, false negative result, false positive result, fungus spore, gene, honey, honeybee, Microsporidia, nonhuman, Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae, nosemosis, nucleotide sequence, priority journal, real time polymerase chain reaction, screening, Animals, Base Sequence, Bees, Chile, DNA, Fungal, Molecular Sequence Data, Nosema, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Apis cerana, Apis mellifera, Nosema, Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae	2012-08-01
Gene expression in honey bee (Apis mellifera) larvae exposed to pesticides and Varroa mites (Varroa destructor)	Honey bee (Apis mellifera) larvae reared in vitro were exposed to one of nine pesticides and/or were challenged with the parasitic mite, Varroa destructor. Total RNA was extracted from individual larvae and first strand cDNAs were generated. Gene-expression changes in larvae were measured using quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting transcripts for pathogens and genes involved in physiological processes, bee health, immunity, and/or xenobiotic detoxification. Transcript levels for Peptidoglycan Recognition Protein (PGRPSC), a pathogen recognition gene, increased in larvae exposed to Varroa mites (P<0.001) and were not changed in pesticide treated larvae. As expected, Varroa-parasitized brood had higher transcripts of Deformed Wing Virus than did control larvae (P<0.001). Varroa parasitism, arguably coupled with virus infection, resulted in significantly higher transcript abundances for the antimicrobial peptides abaecin, hymenoptaecin, and defensin1. Transcript levels for Prophenoloxidase-activating enzyme (PPOact), an immune end product, were elevated in larvae treated with myclobutanil and chlorothalonil (both are fungicides) (P<0.001). Transcript levels for Hexameric storage protein (Hsp70) were significantly upregulated in imidacloprid, fluvalinate, coumaphos, myclobutanil, and amitraz treated larvae. Definitive impacts of pesticides and Varroa parasitism on honey bee larval gene expression were demonstrated. Interactions between larval treatments and gene expression for the targeted genes are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.		insect protein, pesticide, detoxification, gene expression, honeybee, immunity, larva, mite, parasitism, pathogenicity, pesticide, pollution exposure, polymerase chain reaction, protein, viral disease, animal, article, bee, drug effect, gene expression regulation, genetics, growth, development and aging, larva, metabolism, parasitology, physiology, Varroidae, Animals, Bees, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Insect Proteins, Larva, Pesticides, Varroidae, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Deformed wing virus, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2012-08-01
Development of biomarkers of exposure to xenobiotics in the honey bee Apis mellifera: Application to the systemic insecticide thiamethoxam	This study describes the development of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterases (CaE1, CaE2, CaE3), glutathion-S-transferase (GST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and catalase (CAT) as enzyme biomarkers of exposure to xenobiotics such as thiamethoxam in the honey bee Apis mellifera. Extraction efficiency, stability under freezing and biological variability were studied. The extraction procedure achieved good recovery rates in one extraction step and ranged from 65 percent (AChE) to 97.3 percent (GST). Most of the enzymes were stable at -20°C, except ALP that displayed a slight but progressive decrease in its activity. Modifications of enzyme activities were considered after exposure to thiamethoxam at the lethal dose 50 percent (LD50, 51.16ngbee-1) and two sublethal doses, LD50/10 (5.12ngbee-1) and LD50/20 (2.56ngbee-1). The biomarker responses revealed that, even at the lowest dose used, exposure to thiamethoxam elicited sublethal effects and modified the activity of CaEs, GST, CAT and ALP. Different patterns of biomarker responses were observed: no response for AChE, an increase for GST and CAT, and differential effects for CaEs isoforms with a decrease in CaE1 and CaE3 and an increase in CaE2. ALP and CaE3 displayed contrasting variations but only at 2.56ngbee-1. We consider that this profile of biomarker variation could represent a useful fingerprint to characterise exposure to thiamethoxam in the honey bee A. mellifera. This battery of honey bee biomarkers might be a promising option to biomonitor the health of aerial and terrestrial ecosystems and to generate valuable information on the modes of action of pesticides. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.		acetylcholinesterase, alkaline phosphatase, biological marker, carboxylesterase, catalase, glutathione transferase, insecticide, thiamethoxam, unclassified drug, xenobiotic agent, bee, biomarker, enzyme activity, pollution exposure, sublethal effect, thiamethoxam, xenobiotics, article, controlled study, environmental stress, enzyme activity, enzyme stability, exposure, extraction, freezing, honeybee, LD 50, nonhuman, thermostability, xenobiotic stress, Acetylcholinesterase, Animals, Bees, Biological Markers, Catalase, Enzyme Activation, Freezing, Glutathione Transferase, Insecticides, Lethal Dose 50, Nitro Compounds, Oxazines, Thiazoles, Xenobiotics, Apis mellifera	2012-08-01
Learning impairment in honey bees caused by agricultural spray adjuvants	Background: Spray adjuvants are often applied to crops in conjunction with agricultural pesticides in order to boost the efficacy of the active ingredient(s). The adjuvants themselves are largely assumed to be biologically inert and are therefore subject to minimal scrutiny and toxicological testing by regulatory agencies. Honey bees are exposed to a wide array of pesticides as they conduct normal foraging operations, meaning that they are likely exposed to spray adjuvants as well. It was previously unknown whether these agrochemicals have any deleterious effects on honey bee behavior. Methodology/Principal Findings: An improved, automated version of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay with a high degree of trial-to-trial reproducibility was used to measure the olfactory learning ability of honey bees treated orally with sublethal doses of the most widely used spray adjuvants on almonds in the Central Valley of California. Three different adjuvant classes (nonionic surfactants, crop oil concentrates, and organosilicone surfactants) were investigated in this study. Learning was impaired after ingestion of 20 μg organosilicone surfactant, indicating harmful effects on honey bees caused by agrochemicals previously believed to be innocuous. Organosilicones were more active than the nonionic adjuvants, while the crop oil concentrates were inactive. Ingestion was required for the tested adjuvant to have an effect on learning, as exposure via antennal contact only induced no level of impairment. Conclusions/Significance: A decrease in percent conditioned response after ingestion of organosilicone surfactants has been demonstrated here for the first time. Olfactory learning is important for foraging honey bees because it allows them to exploit the most productive floral resources in an area at any given time. Impairment of this learning ability may have serious implications for foraging efficiency at the colony level, as well as potentially many social interactions. Organosilicone spray adjuvants may therefore contribute to the ongoing global decline in honey bee health. © 2012 Ciarlo et al.		adjuvant, agricultural chemical, nonionic surfactant, oil, organosilicon derivative, aerosol, article, assay, automation, concentration (parameters), controlled study, crop, honeybee, learning disorder, mental capacity, nonhuman, olfactory learning ability, reproducibility, United States, Administration, Oral, Agriculture, Animals, Arthropod Antennae, Bees, Environmental Exposure, Honey, Insecticides, Learning, Organosilicon Compounds, Reflex, Surface-Active Agents, Apis mellifera	2012-07-16
Functional diversity within the simple gut microbiota of the honey bee	Animals living in social communities typically harbor a characteristic gut microbiota important for nutrition and pathogen defense. Accordingly, in the gut of the honey bee, Apis mellifera, a distinctive microbial community, composed of a taxonomically restricted set of species specific to social bees, has been identified. Despite the ecological and economical importance of honey bees and the increasing concern about population declines, the role of their gut symbionts for colony health and nutrition is unknown. Here, we sequenced the metagenome of the gut microbiota of honey bees. Unexpectedly, we found a remarkable degree of genetic diversity within the few bacterial species colonizing the bee gut. Comparative analysis of gene contents suggests that different species harbor distinct functional capabilities linked to host interaction, biofilm formation, and carbohydrate breakdown. Whereas the former two functions could be critical for pathogen defense and immunity, the latter one might assist nutrient utilization. In a γ-proteobacterial species, we identified genes encoding pectin-degrading enzymes likely involved in the breakdown of pollen walls. Experimental investigation showed that this activity is restricted to a subset of strains of this species providing evidence for niche specialization. Long-standing association of these gut symbionts with their hosts, favored by the eusocial lifestyle of honey bees, might have promoted the genetic and functional diversification of these bee-specific bacteria. Besides revealing insights intomutualistic functions governed by the microbiota of this important pollinator, our findings indicate that the honey bee can serve as a model for understanding more complex gut-associated microbial communities.		pectin, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, animal experiment, article, Bacillus, bacterial colonization, Betaproteobacteria, biofilm, carbohydrate metabolism, comparative study, enzyme degradation, Gammaproteobacteria, gene function, gene sequence, genetic variability, honeybee, insect genetics, intestine flora, lifestyle, metagenomics, nonhuman, phylogeny, pollen, priority journal, symbiosis, Animals, Bacteria, Bees, Biodiversity, Biofilms, Biological Evolution, Carbohydrate Metabolism, Genetic Variation, Intestines, Metagenome, Metagenomics, Molecular Sequence Data, Pectins, Phylogeny, Polygalacturonase, Symbiosis, Animalia, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Bacteria (microorganisms), Proteobacteria	2012-07-03
Genotypic variability and relationships between mite infestation levels, mite damage, grooming intensity, and removal of Varroa destructor mites in selected strains of worker honey bees (Apis mellifera L.)	The objective of this study was to demonstrate genotypic variability and analyze the relationships between the infestation levels of the parasitic mite . Varroa destructor in honey bee (. Apis mellifera) colonies, the rate of damage of fallen mites, and the intensity with which bees of different genotypes groom themselves to remove mites from their bodies. Sets of paired genotypes that are presumably susceptible and resistant to the varroa mite were compared at the colony level for number of mites falling on sticky papers and for proportion of damaged mites. They were also compared at the individual level for intensity of grooming and mite removal success. Bees from the " resistant" colonies had lower mite population rates (up to 15 fold) and higher percentages of damaged mites (up to 9 fold) than bees from the " susceptible" genotypes. At the individual level, bees from the " resistant" genotypes performed significantly more instances of intense grooming (up to 4 fold), and a significantly higher number of mites were dislodged from the bees' bodies by intense grooming than by light grooming (up to 7 fold) in all genotypes. The odds of mite removal were high and significant for all " resistant" genotypes when compared with the " susceptible" genotypes. The results of this study strongly suggest that grooming behavior and the intensity with which bees perform it, is an important component in the resistance of some honey bee genotypes to the growth of varroa mite populations. The implications of these results are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..		animal, animal disease, animal parasitosis, apiculture, article, bee, disease predisposition, disease resistance, feeding behavior, female, fertility, genetic variability, genetics, genotype, grooming, host parasite interaction, male, mite infestation, parasitology, pathology, physiology, reproduction, sexual behavior, Varroidae, Animals, Beekeeping, Bees, Disease Resistance, Disease Susceptibility, Feeding Behavior, Female, Fertility, Genetic Variation, Genotype, Grooming, Host-Parasite Interactions, Male, Mite Infestations, Parasitic Diseases, Animal, Reproduction, Sexual Behavior, Animal, Varroidae, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2012-07-01
Simultaneous stressors: Interactive effects of an immune challenge and dietary toxin can be detrimental to honeybees	Recent large-scale mortality of honeybee colonies is believed to be caused by multiple interactions between diseases, parasites, pesticide exposure, and other stress factors. To test whether a dual challenge has an additive effect in reducing survival, we experimentally stimulated the immune system of caged Apis mellifera scutellata workers from six colonies by injecting saline or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and additionally fed them the alkaloid nicotine (0 μM, 3 μM and 300 μM in 0.63. M sucrose). Workers did not increase their sucrose intake to compensate for the immune system activation, and those injected with E. coli LPS decreased their intake on the highest nicotine concentration. In the single challenges, injection and high nicotine doses negatively affected survival. All injected worker groups showed reduced survival. Without nicotine, survival of the saline and E. coli LPS worker groups was similar, but survival of E. coli LPS-challenged workers dropped below that of the saline groups when additionally challenged by nicotine, with bees dying earlier at higher nicotine concentrations. In the dual challenge of saline injection and dietary nicotine, a reduced effect on survival was observed, with lower mortality than expected from the summed mortalities due to the single challenges. However, additive and synergistic effects on survival were observed in workers simultaneously challenged by E. coli LPS and nicotine, indicating that interactive effects of simultaneous pathogen exposure and dietary toxin are detrimental to honeybee fitness. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.		lipopolysaccharide, nicotine, sucrose, coliform bacterium, dose-response relationship, food intake, honeybee, immune system, mortality, pollution effect, pollution exposure, polysaccharide, salinity, sugar, survival, synergism, toxin, animal, animal food, article, bee, diet, drug effect, Escherichia coli, female, immunology, metabolism, Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena, Animals, Bees, Diet, Escherichia coli, Female, Lipopolysaccharides, Nicotine, Sucrose, Apis mellifera, Apis mellifera scutellata, Apoidea, Escherichia coli	2012-07-01
Movement of soil-applied imidacloprid and thiamethoxam into nectar and pollen of squash (Cucurbita pepo)	There has been recent interest in the threat to bees posed by the use of systemic insecticides. One concern is that systemic insecticides may translocate from the soil into pollen and nectar of plants, where they would be ingested by pollinators. This paper reports on the movement of two such systemic neonicotinoid insecticides, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, into the pollen and nectar of flowers of squash (Cucurbita pepo cultivars "Multipik," "Sunray" and "Bush Delicata") when applied to soil by two methods: (1) sprayed into soil before seeding, or (2) applied through drip irrigation in a single treatment after transplant. All insecticide treatments were within labeled rates for these compounds. Pollen and nectar samples were analyzed using a standard extraction method widely used for pesticides (QuEChERS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometric analysis. The concentrations found in nectar, 10±3 ppb (mean ± s.d) for imidacloprid and 11±6 ppb for thiamethoxam, are higher than concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticides in nectar of canola and sunflower grown from treated seed, and similar to those found in a recent study of neonicotinoids applied to pumpkins at transplant and through drip irrigation. The concentrations in pollen, 14±8 ppb for imidacloprid and 12±9 ppb for thiamethoxam, are higher than those found for seed treatments in most studies, but at the low end of the range found in the pumpkin study. Our concentrations fall into the range being investigated for sublethal effects on honey bees and bumble bees. © 2012 Stoner, Eitzer.		imidacloprid, insecticide, thiamethoxam, unclassified drug, article, controlled study, flower, irrigation (agriculture), liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, nectar, nonhuman, pesticide spraying, pollen, rapeseed, seed treatment, soil treatment, squash, sunflower, Animals, Bees, Chromatography, Liquid, Cucurbita, Imidazoles, Insecticides, Mass Spectrometry, Nitro Compounds, Oxazines, Plant Nectar, Pollen, Pollination, Seeds, Soil, Thiazoles, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Bombus (genus), Brassica napus var. napus, Cucurbita, Cucurbita pepo, Enceliopsis, Helianthus	2012-06-27
Imidacloprid-induced impairment of mushroom bodies and behavior of the native stingless bee melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides	Declines in pollinator colonies represent a worldwide concern. The widespread use of agricultural pesticides is recognized as a potential cause of these declines. Previous studies have examined the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid on pollinator colonies, but these investigations have mainly focused on adult honey bees. Native stingless bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponinae) are key pollinators in neotropical areas and are threatened with extinction due to deforestation and pesticide use. Few studies have directly investigated the effects of pesticides on these pollinators. Furthermore, the existing impact studies did not address the issue of larval ingestion of contaminated pollen and nectar, which could potentially have dire consequences for the colony. Here, we assessed the effects of imidacloprid ingestion by stingless bee larvae on their survival, development, neuromorphology and adult walking behavior. Increasing doses of imidacloprid were added to the diet provided to individual worker larvae of the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides throughout their development. Survival rates above 50% were only observed at insecticide doses lower than 0.0056 μg active ingredient (a.i.)/bee. No sublethal effect on body mass or developmental time was observed in the surviving insects, but the pesticide treatment negatively affected the development of mushroom bodies in the brain and impaired the walking behavior of newly emerged adult workers. Therefore, stingless bee larvae are particularly susceptible to imidacloprid, as it caused both high mortality and sublethal effects that impaired brain development and compromised mobility at the young adult stage. These findings demonstrate the lethal effects of imidacloprid on native stingless bees and provide evidence of novel serious sublethal effects that may compromise colony survival. The ecological and economic importance of neotropical stingless bees as pollinators, their susceptibility to insecticides and the vulnerability of their larvae to insecticide exposure emphasize the importance of studying these species. © 2012 Tomé et al.		imidacloprid, imidacloprid, imidazole derivative, nitro derivative, animal tissue, article, bioassay, body mass, chemical analysis, chemical structure, chromatography, controlled study, lethality, mass spectrometry, Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides, morphology, mushroom body, Neotropics, nonhuman, stingless bee, survival rate, survival time, walking, animal, animal behavior, bee, bites and stings, body weight, brain, cytology, diet, drug effect, growth, development and aging, larva, mushroom body, social dominance, survival, time, Apidae, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Basidiomycota, Hexapoda, Hymenoptera, Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides, Meliponinae, Animals, Bees, Behavior, Animal, Bites and Stings, Body Weight, Brain, Diet, Hierarchy, Social, Imidazoles, Larva, Mushroom Bodies, Nitro Compounds, Survival Analysis, Time Factors, Walking	2012-06-04
Critical aspects of the Nosema spp. diagnostic sampling in honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies	Nosemosis is one of the most widespread of the adult honey bee diseases and causes major economic losses to beekeepers. Two microsporidia have been described infecting honey bees worldwide, Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae, whose seasonality and pathology differ markedly. An increasing prevalence of microsporidian infections in honey bees has been observed worldwide during the last years. Because nosemosis has detrimental effects on both strength and productivity of the infected colonies, an accurate and reliable method to evaluate the presence of Nosema in honey bee colonies is needed. In this study a high degree of variability in the detection of microsporidia depending on the random subsample analyzed was found, suggesting that both sample size and the time of collection (month and day of sampling) notably affect the diagnosis. © Springer-Verlag 2011.		article, honeybee, nonhuman, Nosema, Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae, nosemosis, organism colony, priority journal, random sample, sample size, seasonal variation, Animals, Bees, Mycology, Nosema, Reproducibility of Results, Specimen Handling, Apis mellifera, Microsporidia, Nosema, Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae	2012-06-01
Phoretic presence and incidence of Varroa destructor A. (Mesostigmata:Varroidae) in honey bee colonies of Apis mellifera (Hymenptera:Apidae), in Colombia	The aim of this work has been centered on the phoretic incidence of Varroa destructoron the honeybee colonies established at the montane dry and the moist forest, also in a tropical moist and dry forest environment.Sealed broods and adult honeybees, exposed to the varroa mite, were isolated from the brood chamberin 184 Colombian honeybees established at different geographical positions. Morphometric assessment wasconducted in three stages of varroa life-cycle.Honeybee ecotypes associated to each life zone were classified using discriminant analysis based on morphometric measurements. The hives studied were classified according to exposure degree, using the ratio between varroa mite and honeybees. Incidence study was performed using contingence analysis. High incidence of Varroa destructorin Colombian beekeeping system had different infestation levels from tolerant to severe exposures. Population dynamics show a positive impact for varroa mite in moist and cold environment, and low effect on Africanized honeybees at warm environments. In 45% colonies honeybee coexist with varroa mite in a relative low proportion (1 to 4), but in 68% the ectoparasite proportion begins to be significant or high exposure. Morphometric parameters on female varroa mitesshow classic ranges between 1035 and 1605μm. The phoretic phase reveal the dynamics of varroosis in beekeeping systems.			2012-06-01
Using video-tracking to assess sublethal effects of pesticides on honey bees (Apis mellifera L.)	Concern about the role of pesticides in honey bee decline has highlighted the need to examine the effects of sublethal exposure on bee behaviors. The video-tracking system EthoVisionXT (Noldus Information Technologies) was used to measure the effects of sublethal exposure to tau-fluvalinate and imidacloprid on honey bee locomotion, interactions, and time spent near a food source over a 24-h observation period. Bees were either treated topically with 0.3, 1.5, and 3μg tau-fluvalinate or exposed to 0.05, 0.5, 5.0, 50, and 500 ppb imidacloprid in a sugar agar cube. Tau-fluvalinate caused a significant reduction in distance moved at all dose levels (p<0.05), as did 50 and 500 ppb imidacloprid (p<0.001). Bees exposed to 50 and 500 ppb spent significantly more time near the food source than control bees (p<0.05). Interaction time decreased as time in the food zone increased for both chemicals. This study documents that video-tracking of bee behavior can enhance current protocols for measuring the effects of pesticides on honey bees at sublethal levels. It may provide a means of identifying problematic compounds for further testing. © 2012 SETAC.

Dietary traces of neonicotinoid pesticides as a cause of population declines in honey bees: An evaluation by Hill's epidemiological criteria	Background: Honey bees are important pollinators of both crops and wild plants. Pesticide regimes that threaten their sustainability should therefore be assessed. As an example, evidence that the agricultural use of neonicotinoid pesticides is a cause of the recently observed declines in honey bees is examined. The aim is to define exacting demographic conditions for a detrimental factor to precipitate a population decline, and Hill's epidemiological 'causality criteria' are employed as a structured process for making an expert judgement about the proposition that trace dietary neonicotinoids in nectar and pollen cause population declines in honey bees. Results: In spite of the absence of decisive experimental results, the analysis shows that, while the proposition is a substantially justified conjecture in the context of current knowledge, it is also substantially contraindicated by a wide variety of circumstantial epidemiological evidence. Conclusion:It is concluded that dietary neonicotinoids cannot be implicated in honey bee declines, but this position is provisional because important gaps remain in current knowledge. Avenues for further investigations to resolve this longstanding uncertainty are therefore identified. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.		nicotine, pesticide residue, agrochemical, demography, diet, ecotoxicology, epidemiology, honeybee, insecticide, pollination, pollution effect, population decline, sustainability, uncertainty analysis, animal, article, bee, chemistry, diet, epidemiology, physiology, population dynamics, Animals, Bees, Diet, Epidemiologic Studies, Nicotine, Pesticide Residues, Population Dynamics, Apis mellifera, Hexapoda	2012-06-01
Synergistic parasite-pathogen interactions mediated by host immunity can drive the collapse of honeybee colonies	The health of the honeybee and, indirectly, global crop production are threatened by several biotic and abiotic factors, which play a poorly defined role in the induction of widespread colony losses. Recent descriptive studies suggest that colony losses are often related to the interaction between pathogens and other stress factors, including parasites. Through an integrated analysis of the population and molecular changes associated with the collapse of honeybee colonies infested by the parasitic mite Varroa destructor, we show that this parasite can de-stabilise the within-host dynamics of Deformed wing virus (DWV), transforming a cryptic and vertically transmitted virus into a rapidly replicating killer, which attains lethal levels late in the season. The de-stabilisation of DWV infection is associated with an immunosuppression syndrome, characterized by a strong down-regulation of the transcription factor NF-κB. The centrality of NF-κB in host responses to a range of environmental challenges suggests that this transcription factor can act as a common currency underlying colony collapse that may be triggered by different causes. Our results offer an integrated account for the multifactorial origin of honeybee losses and a new framework for assessing, and possibly mitigating, the impact of environmental challenges on honeybee health. © 2012 Nazzi et al.		immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein, article, colony collapse, crop production, Deformed wing virus, honeybee, host pathogen interaction, host susceptibility, immune deficiency, RNA virus, Varroa, virus transmission, animal, animal disease, bee, host parasite interaction, immunology, insect virus, mite infestation, mixed infection, parasitology, real time polymerase chain reaction, RNA virus infection, Varroidae, Acari, Apis mellifera, Deformed wing virus, Varroa destructor, Animals, Bees, Coinfection, Host-Parasite Interactions, Insect Viruses, Mite Infestations, NF-kappa B, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, RNA Virus Infections, RNA Viruses, Varroidae	2012-06-01
In situ replication of honey bee colony collapse disorder	The concern of persistent loss of honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies worldwide since 2006, a phenomenon referred to as colony collapse disorder (CCD), has led us to investigate the role of imidacloprid, one of the neonicotinoid insecticides, in the emergence of CCD. CCD is commonly characterized by the sudden disappearance of honey bees (specifically worker bees) from hives containing adequate food and various stages of brood in abandoned colonies that are not occupied by honey bees from other colonies. This in situ study was designed to replicate CCD based on a plausible mechanistic hypothesis in which the occurrence of CCD since 2006 was resulted from the presence of imidacloprid, one of the neonicotinoid insecticides, in high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), fed to honey bees as an alternative to sucrose-based food. We used a replicated split-plot design consisting of 4 independent apiary sites. Each apiary consisted of 4 different imidacloprid-treated hives and a control hive. The dosages used in this study were determined to reflect imidacloprid residue levels reported in the environment previously. All hives had no diseases of symptoms of parasitism during the 13-week dosing regime, and were alive 12 weeks afterward. However, 15 of 16 imidacloprid-treated hives (94%) were dead across 4 apiaries 23 weeks post imidacloprid dosing. Dead hives were remarkably empty except for stores of food and some pollen left, a resemblance of CCD. Data from this in situ study provide convincing evidence that exposure to sub-lethal levels of imidacloprid in HFCS causes honey bees to exhibit symptoms consistent to CCD 23 weeks post imida-cloprid dosing. The survival of the control hives managed alongside with the pesticide-treated hives unequivocally augments this conclusion.

Direct effect of acaricides on pathogen loads and gene expression levels in honey bees Apis mellifera	The effect of using acaricides to control varroa mites has long been a concern to the beekeeping industry due to unintended negative impacts on honey bee health. Irregular ontogenesis, suppression of immune defenses, and impairment of normal behavior have been linked to pesticide use. External stressors, including parasites and the pathogens they vector, can confound studies on the effects of pesticides on the metabolism of honey bees. This is the case of . Varroa destructor, a mite that negatively affects honey bee health on many levels, from direct parasitism, which diminishes honey bee productivity, to vectoring and/or activating other pathogens, including many viruses. Here we present a gene expression profile comprising genes acting on diverse metabolic levels (detoxification, immunity, and development) in a honey bee population that lacks the influence of varroa mites. We present data for hives treated with five different acaricides; Apiguard (thymol), Apistan (tau-fluvalinate), Checkmite (coumaphos), Miteaway (formic acid) and ApiVar (amitraz). The results indicate that thymol, coumaphos and formic acid are able to alter some metabolic responses. These include detoxification gene expression pathways, components of the immune system responsible for cellular response and the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, and developmental genes. These could potentially interfere with the health of individual honey bees and entire colonies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.		acaricide, transcriptome, acaricide, detoxification, gene expression, honeybee, immune system, mite, parasitism, pathogen, physiological response, virus, animal, article, bee, drug effect, gene expression, genetics, metabolism, parasitology, Acaricides, Animals, Bees, Gene Expression, Transcriptome, Acari, Apis mellifera, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2012-05-01
The effect of a piperonyl butoxide/tau-fluvalinate mixture on pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus) and honey bees (Apis mellifera)	Background: Previous work has characterised pyrethroid resistance in pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus F.) as principally an oxidative mechanism. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) can synergise this resistance in the field, but its effects on the honey bee are thought to be unacceptable. Results: A field trial in Poland was conducted to show that a mixture of PBO and tau-fluvalinate at the registered rate gave increased and longer-lasting control of resistant pollen beetle. Four days after spraying with tau-fluvalinate, only 20% of pollen beetles were controlled, compared with 70% if the tau-fluvalinate/PBO mixture was used. No detriment to honey bee health was observed using the same mixture. CONCLUSIONS: PBO, if used in conjunction with a pyrethroid of relatively low bee toxicity, can successfully overcome pyrethroid resistance in pollen beetle without incurring an increased loss of honey bees, even if they are present at the time of spraying. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.		fluvalinate, insecticide, nitrile, piperonyl butoxide, pyrethroid, beetle, ecotoxicology, honeybee, nontarget organism, oxidation, pesticide application, pesticide resistance, pyrethroid, resistance management, animal, article, bee, beetle, drug effect, drug interaction, insecticide resistance, Animals, Bees, Beetles, Drug Interactions, Insecticide Resistance, Insecticides, Nitriles, Piperonyl Butoxide, Pyrethrins, Poland, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Coleoptera, Meligethes, Meligethes aeneus	2012-05-01
Linking evolutionary lineage with parasite and pathogen prevalence in the Iberian honey bee	The recent decline in honey bee colonies observed in both European countries and worldwide is of great interest and concern, although the underlying causes remain poorly understood. In recent years, growing evidence has implicated parasites and pathogens in this decline of both the vitality and number of honey bee colonies. The Iberian Peninsula provides an interesting environment in which to study the occurrence of pathogens and parasites in the host honey bee populations due to the presence of two evolutionary lineages in . A. m. iberiensis (Western European [M] or African [A]). . Here, we provide the first evidence linking the population structure of the Iberian honey bee with the prevalence of some of its most important parasites and pathogens: the . Varroa destructor mite and the microsporidia . Nosema apis and . Nosema ceranae. Using data collected in two surveys conducted in 2006 and 2010 in 41 Spanish provinces, the evolutionary lineage and the presence of the three parasitic organisms cited above were analyzed in a total of 228 colonies. In 2006 . N. apis was found in a significantly higher proportion of M lineage honey bees than in the A lineage. However, in 2010 this situation had changed significantly due to a higher prevalence of . N. ceranae. We observed no significant relationships in either year between the distributions of . V. destructor or . N. ceranae and the evolutionary lineage present in . A. m. iberiensis colonies, but the effects of these organisms on the genetic diversity of the honey bee populations need further research. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.		animal, article, bee, evolution, genetics, isolation and purification, Nosema, parasitology, prevalence, Spain, Varroidae, Animals, Bees, Biological Evolution, Nosema, Prevalence, Spain, Varroidae, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apis mellifera iberiensis, Microsporidia, Nosema, Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2012-05-01
Interpretation of honeybees contact toxicity associated to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors	The widespread use of different pesticides generates adverse effects on non target organisms like honeybees. Organophosphorous and carbamates kill honeybees through the inactivation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), thereby interfering with nerve signaling and function. For this class of pesticides, it is fundamental to understand the relationship between their structures and the contact toxicity for honeybees. A Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) study was carried out on 45 derivatives by a genetic algorithm approach starting from more than 2500 descriptors. In parallel, a new 3D model of AChE associated to honeybees was defined.

Plant essential oils and formamidines as insecticides/ acaricides: What are the molecular targets?	The parasitic mite Varroa destructor is the main cause of the severe reduction in beekeeping during the last few decades. Therefore, efforts have been made to develop chemical treatments against the parasite. In the past, synthetic products were preferentially used to combat Varroa mites. Nowadays, mainly plant essential oils and organic acids are applied because they are safer and impose less unfavorable effects on the environment. Essential oils contain mixtures of mostly volatile and odorous terpenoid constituents. The molecular targets of these substances are tyramine and/or octopamine receptors that control and modulate vital functions ranging from metabolism to behavior. Disturbing the native function of these receptors in the mite results in deleterious effects in this parasite. This overview considers not only tyramine and octopamine receptors but also other potential targets of essential oils including ionotropic GABAA receptors, TRP type ion channels, and acetylcholinesterase. © INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag, France, 2012.		apiculture, biological control, biopesticide, enzyme activity, essential oil, metabolism, mite, molecular analysis, organic acid, parasite control, pesticide, protein, terpene	2012-05-01
Neonicotinoids in bees: A review on concentrations, side-effects and risk assessment	Neonicotinoid insecticides are successfully applied to control pests in a variety of agricultural crops; however, they may not only affect pest insects but also non-target organisms such as pollinators. This review summarizes, for the first time, 15 years of research on the hazards of neonicotinoids to bees including honey bees, bumble bees and solitary bees. The focus of the paper is on three different key aspects determining the risks of neonicotinoid field concentrations for bee populations: (1) the environmental neonicotinoid residue levels in plants, bees and bee products in relation to pesticide application, (2) the reported side-effects with special attention for sublethal effects, and (3) the usefulness for the evaluation of neonicotinoids of an already existing risk assessment scheme for systemic compounds. Although environmental residue levels of neonicotinoids were found to be lower than acute/chronic toxicity levels, there is still a lack of reliable data as most analyses were conducted near the detection limit and for only few crops. Many laboratory studies described lethal and sublethal effects of neonicotinoids on the foraging behavior, and learning and memory abilities of bees, while no effects were observed in field studies at field-realistic dosages. The proposed risk assessment scheme for systemic compounds was shown to be applicable to assess the risk for side-effects of neonicotinoids as it considers the effect on different life stages and different levels of biological organization (organism versus colony). Future research studies should be conducted with field-realistic concentrations, relevant exposure and evaluation durations. Molecular markers may be used to improve risk assessment by a better understanding of the mode of action (interaction with receptors) of neonicotinoids in bees leading to the identification of environmentally safer compounds. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.		imidacloprid, insecticide, neonicotinoid, receptor, unclassified drug, bee, behavioral response, bioaccumulation, biomarker, detection method, identification method, insecticide, laboratory method, pollution effect, population dynamics, reproduction, risk assessment, sublethal effect, toxicity, acute toxicity, bee, behavior disorder, bioaccumulation, chemical analysis, chronic toxicity, concentration (parameters), contamination, environmental exposure, foraging, honey, intoxication, laboratory test, learning disorder, lethality, memory disorder, metabolism, molecular biology, mortality, nectar, nonhuman, plant, pollen, priority journal, protein interaction, residue analysis, review, risk assessment, side effect, toxicity testing, Animals, Bees, Crops, Agricultural, Environmental Monitoring, Imidazoles, Insecticides, Nitro Compounds, Pollination, Reproduction, Risk Assessment, Toxicity Tests, Acute, Toxicity Tests, Chronic, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Bombus (genus), Hexapoda	2012-05-01
Winter survival of individual honey bees and honey bee colonies depends on level of varroa destructor infestation	Background: Recent elevated winter loss of honey bee colonies is a major concern. The presence of the mite Varroa destructor in colonies places an important pressure on bee health. V. destructor shortens the lifespan of individual bees, while long lifespan during winter is a primary requirement to survive until the next spring. We investigated in two subsequent years the effects of different levels of V. destructor infestation during the transition from short-lived summer bees to long-lived winter bees on the lifespan of individual bees and the survival of bee colonies during winter. Colonies treated earlier in the season to reduce V. destructor infestation during the development of winter bees were expected to have longer bee lifespan and higher colony survival after winter. Methodology/Principal Findings: Mite infestation was reduced using acaricide treatments during different months (July, August, September, or not treated). We found that the number of capped brood cells decreased drastically between August and November, while at the same time, the lifespan of the bees (marked cohorts) increased indicating the transition to winter bees. Low V. destructor infestation levels before and during the transition to winter bees resulted in an increase in lifespan of bees and higher colony survival compared to colonies that were not treated and that had higher infestation levels. A variety of stress-related factors could have contributed to the variation in longevity and winter survival that we found between years. Conclusions/Significance: This study contributes to theory about the multiple causes for the recent elevated colony losses in honey bees. Our study shows the correlation between long lifespan of winter bees and colony loss in spring. Moreover, we show that colonies treated earlier in the season had reduced V. destructor infestation during the development of winter bees resulting in longer bee lifespan and higher colony survival after winter. © 2012 van Dooremalen et al.		acaricide, article, controlled study, environmental stress, environmental temperature, honeybee, lifespan, longevity, nonhuman, organism colony, survival, varroosis, winter, animal, bee, growth, development and aging, physiology, season, survival, temperature, time, Varroidae, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Varroa destructor, Acaricides, Animals, Bees, Longevity, Seasons, Survival Analysis, Temperature, Time Factors, Varroidae	2012-04-27
A common pesticide decreases foraging success and survival in honey bees	Nonlethal exposure of honey bees to thiamethoxam (neonicotinoid systemic pesticide) causes high mortality due to homing failure at levels that could put a colony at risk of collapse.

Parasite-insecticide interactions: A case study of Nosema ceranae and fipronil synergy on honeybee	In ecosystems, a variety of biological, chemical and physical stressors may act in combination to induce illness in populations of living organisms. While recent surveys reported that parasite-insecticide interactions can synergistically and negatively affect honeybee survival, the importance of sequence in exposure to stressors has hardly received any attention. In this work, Western honeybees (Apis mellifera) were sequentially or simultaneously infected by the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae and chronically exposed to a sublethal dose of the insecticide fipronil, respectively chosen as biological and chemical stressors. Interestingly, every combination tested led to a synergistic effect on honeybee survival, with the most significant impacts when stressors were applied at the emergence of honeybees. Our study presents significant outcomes on beekeeping management but also points out the potential risks incurred by any living organism frequently exposed to both pathogens and insecticides in their habitat.		fipronil, insecticide, pyrazole derivative, animal, article, bee, host parasite interaction, Nosema, parasitology, physiology, Animals, Bees, Host-Parasite Interactions, Insecticides, Nosema, Pyrazoles	2012-04-19
Circadian changes in susceptibility of young honeybee workers to intoxication by pyrethroid, carbamate, organophosphorus, benzoyl urea and pyridine derivative insecticides	In the years 2009 and 2010, in the apiaries surrounding Tarnobrzeg and Leżajsk, Poland (close to the Carpathian Mountains) research was carried out on diurnal changes in the sensitivity of young honey bee (Apis mellifera) workers to insecticides from various chemical groups: pyrethroids (esfenvalerate, cyhalothrin, alpha-cypermethrin, beta-cyfluthrin, deltamethrin), derivatives of pyridine (pyriproxyfen), carbamate (pirimicarb), organophosphate (diazinon), and benzoyl urea derivative (teflubenzuron). The analyses consisted of intoxicating subsequent groups of honey bees in 2-hour intervals, for a period of 24 hours with selected xenobiotics. The results received indicate that the honey bee shows a statistically significant susceptibility to insecticides, changing in the diurnal rhythm.		Apis mellifera	2012-04-01
A perspective on modern pesticides, pelagic fish declines, and unknown ecological resilience in highly managed ecosystems	Pesticides applied on land are commonly transported by runoff or spray drift to aquatic ecosystems, where they are potentially toxic to fishes and other nontarget organisms. Pesticides add to and interact with other stressors of ecosystem processes, including surface-water diversions, losses of spawning and rearing habitats, nonnative species, and harmful algal blooms. Assessing the cumulative effects of pesticides on species or ecological functions has been difficult for historical, legal, conceptual, and practical reasons. To explore these challenges, we examine current-use (modern) pesticides and their potential connections to the abundances of fishes in the San Francisco Estuary (California). Declines in delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and other species have triggered mandatory and expensive management actions in the urbanizing estuary and agriculturally productive Central Valley. Our inferences are transferable to other situations in which toxics may drive changes in ecological status and trends. © 2012 by American Institute of Biological Sciences.

The greening of pesticide-environment interactions: Some personal observations	Background: Pesticide-environment interactions are bidirectional. The environment alters pesticides by metabolism and photodegradation, and pesticides in turn change the environment through nontarget or secondary effects. Objectives: Approximately 900 currently used commercial pesticides of widely diverse structures act by nearly a hundred mechanisms to control insects, weeds, and fungi, usually with minimal disruption of nature's equilibrium. Here I consider some aspects of the discovery, development, and use of ecofriendly or green pesticides (i.e., pesticides that are safe, effective, and biodegradable with minimal adverse secondary effects on the environment). Emphasis is given to research in my laboratory. Discussion: The need for understanding and improving pesticide-environment interactions began with production of the first major insecticide approximately 150 years ago: The arsenical poison Paris Green was green in color but definitely not ecofriendly. Development and use of other pesticides has led to a variety of problems. Topics considered here include the need for high purity [e.g., hexachlorocyclohexane and polychloroborane isomers and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T)], environmental degradation and the bioactivity of resulting photoproducts and metabolites, pesticide photochemistry (including the use of structural optimization, photostabilizers, and photosensitizers to achieve suitable persistence), the presence of multiple active ingredients in botanical insecticides, the need to consider compounds with common mechanisms of action, issues related to primary and secondary targets, and chemically induced or genetically modified changes in plant biochemistry. Many insecticides are bird, fish, and honeybee toxicants, whereas herbicides and fungicides pose fewer environmental problems. Conclusion: Six factors have contributed to the greening of pesticide-environment interactions: advances in pesticide chemistry and toxicology, banning of many chlorinated hydrocarbons, the development of new biochemical targets, increased reliance on genetically modified crops that reduce the amount and variety of pesticides applied, emphasis on biodegradability and environmental protection, and integrated pest- and pesticide-management systems.		chlorinated hydrocarbon, fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, pesticide, pyrethroid, article, beneficial insect, biodegradability, bird, ecotoxicology, environment, environmental protection, fish, honeybee, human, mammal, metabolism, nonhuman, pest control, photochemistry, priority journal, soil, target organism, transgenic plant, Animals, Ecotoxicology, Environment, Environmental Policy, Fungi, Fungicides, Industrial, Government Regulation, Herbicides, History, 20th Century, History, 21st Century, Insecticides, Insects, Pesticides, Plants, Plants, Genetically Modified, Species Specificity, Vertebrates, Apis mellifera, Fungi, Gomphosus, Hexapoda	2012-04-01
Virulence of mixed fungal infections in honey bee brood	Introduction: Honey bees, Apis mellifera, have a diverse community of pathogens. Previous research has mostly focused on bacterial brood diseases of high virulence, but milder diseases caused by fungal pathogens have recently attracted more attention. This interest has been triggered by partial evidence that co-infection with multiple pathogens has the potential to accelerate honey bee mortality. In the present study we tested whether co-infection with closely related fungal brood-pathogen species that are either specialists or non-specialist results in higher host mortality than infections with a single specialist. We used a specially designed laboratory assay to expose honey bee larvae to controlled infections with spores of three Ascosphaera species: A. apis, the specialist pathogen that causes chalkbrood disease in honey bees, A. proliperda, a specialist pathogen that causes chalkbrood disease in solitary bees, and A. atra, a saprophytic fungus growing typically on pollen brood-provision masses of solitary bees.Results: We show for the first time that single infection with a pollen fungus A. atra may induce some mortality and that co-infection with A. atra and A. apis resulted in higher mortality of honey bees compared to single infections with A. apis. However, similar single and mixed infections with A. proliperda did not increase brood mortality.Conclusion: Our results show that co-infection with a closely related fungal species can either increase or have no effect on host mortality, depending on the identity of the second species. Together with other studies suggesting that multiple interacting pathogens may be contributing to worldwide honey bee health declines, our results highlight the importance of studying effects of multiple infections, even when all interacting species are not known to be specialist pathogens. © 2012 Vojvodic et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Characterization of the active microbiotas associated with honey bees reveals healthier and broader communities when colonies are genetically diverse	Recent losses of honey bee colonies have led to increased interest in the microbial communities that are associated with these important pollinators. A critical function that bacteria perform for their honey bee hosts, but one that is poorly understood, is the transformation of worker-collected pollen into bee bread, a nutritious food product that can be stored for long periods in colonies. We used 16S rRNA pyrosequencing to comprehensively characterize in genetically diverse and genetically uniform colonies the active bacterial communities that are found on honey bees, in their digestive tracts, and in bee bread. This method provided insights that have not been revealed by past studies into the content and benefits of honey bee-associated microbial communities. Colony microbiotas differed substantially between sampling environments and were dominated by several anaerobic bacterial genera never before associated with honey bees, but renowned for their use by humans to ferment food. Colonies with genetically diverse populations of workers, a result of the highly promiscuous mating behavior of queens, benefited from greater microbial diversity, reduced pathogen loads, and increased abundance of putatively helpful bacteria, particularly species from the potentially probiotic genus Bifidobacterium. Across all colonies, Bifidobacterium activity was negatively correlated with the activity of genera that include pathogenic microbes; this relationship suggests a possible target for understanding whether microbes provide protective benefits to honey bees. Within-colony diversity shapes microbiotas associated with honey bees in ways that may have important repercussions for colony function and health. Our findings illuminate the importance of honey bee-bacteria symbioses and examine their intersection with nutrition, pathogen load, and genetic diversity, factors that are considered key to understanding honey bee decline. © 2012 Mattila et al.

Honey bees (Apis mellifera) reared in brood combs containing high levels of pesticide residues exhibit increased susceptibility to Nosema (Microsporidia) infection	Nosema ceranae and pesticide exposure can contribute to honey bee health decline. Bees reared from brood comb containing high or low levels of pesticide residues were placed in two common colony environments. One colony was inoculated weekly with N. ceranae spores in sugar syrup and the other colony received sugar syrup only. Worker honey bees were sampled weekly from the treatment and control colonies and analyzed for Nosema spore levels. Regardless of the colony environment (spores. +. syrup added or syrup only added), a higher proportion of bees reared from the high pesticide residue brood comb became infected with N. ceranae, and at a younger age, compared to those reared in low residue brood combs. These data suggest that developmental exposure to pesticides in brood comb increases the susceptibility of bees to N. ceranae infection. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..		pesticide, animal, animal disease, article, bee, disease predisposition, microsporidiosis, Nosema, parasitology, Animals, Bees, Disease Susceptibility, Microsporidiosis, Nosema, Pesticides, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Bacteria (microorganisms), Microsporidia, Nosema, Nosema ceranae	2012-03-01
Ecologically appropriate xenobiotics induce cytochrome P450s in Apis Mellifera	Background: Honey bees are exposed to phytochemicals through the nectar, pollen and propolis consumed to sustain the colony. They may also encounter mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus fungi infesting pollen in beebread. Moreover, bees are exposed to agricultural pesticides, particularly in-hive acaricides used against the parasite Varroa destructor. They cope with these and other xenobiotics primarily through enzymatic detoxificative processes, but the regulation of detoxificative enzymes in honey bees remains largely unexplored. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used several approaches to ascertain effects of dietary toxins on bee susceptibility to synthetic and natural xenobiotics, including the acaricide tau-fluvalinate, the agricultural pesticide imidacloprid, and the naturally occurring mycotoxin aflatoxin. We administered potential inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes, the principal biochemical system for Phase 1 detoxification in insects, to investigate how detoxification is regulated. The drug phenobarbital induces P450s in many insects, yet feeding bees with phenobarbital had no effect on the toxicity of tau-fluvalinate, a pesticide known to be detoxified by bee P450s. Similarly, no P450 induction, as measured by tau-fluvalinate tolerance, occurred in bees fed xanthotoxin, salicylic acid, or indole-3-carbinol, all of which induce P450s in other insects. Only quercetin, a common pollen and honey constituent, reduced tau-fluvalinate toxicity. In microarray comparisons no change in detoxificative gene expression was detected in phenobarbital-treated bees. However, northern blot analyses of guts of bees fed extracts of honey, pollen and propolis showed elevated expression of three CYP6AS P450 genes. Diet did not influence tau-fluvalinate or imidacloprid toxicity in bioassays; however, aflatoxin toxicity was higher in bees consuming sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup than in bees consuming honey. Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that regulation of honey bee P450s is tuned to chemicals occurring naturally in the hive environment and that, in terms of toxicological capacity, a diet of sugar is not equivalent to a diet of honey. © 2012 Johnson et al.		3 indolemethanol, acaricide, aflatoxin, complementary DNA, cytochrome P450, DNA, fructose, imidacloprid, mycotoxin, phenobarbital, quercetin, salicylic acid, sucrose, carbohydrate, cytochrome P450, xenobiotic agent, article, Aspergillus, controlled study, detoxification, DNA microarray, gene expression, honeybee, LD 50, nonhuman, Northern blotting, protein expression, RNA isolation, Varroa, xenobiotic stress, animal, bee, diet, drug antagonism, drug effect, environment, enzymology, genetics, honey, transcription initiation, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Aspergillus, Fungi, Hexapoda, Varroa destructor, Zea mays, Animals, Bees, Carbohydrates, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, Diet, Environment, Honey, Transcriptional Activation, Xenobiotics	2012-02-03
Varroa destructor: Research avenues towards sustainable control	Pollination by honey bees plays a key role in the functioning of ecosystems and optimisation of agricultural yields. Severe honey bee colony losses worldwide have raised concerns about the sustainability of these pollination services. In many cases, bee mortality appears to be the product of many interacting factors, but there is a growing consensus that the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor plays the role of the major predisposing liability. We argue that the fight against this mite should be a priority for future honey bee health research. We highlight the lack of efficient control methods currently available against the parasite and discuss the need for new approaches. Gaps in our knowledge of the biology and epidemiology of the mite are identified and a research road map towards sustainable control is drawn. Innovative and challenging approaches are suggested in order to stimulate research efforts and ensure that honey bees will be able to sustainably fulfil their role in the ecosystem. © IBRA 2012.

The honey bee crisis	Since 2006, it has been hard to ignore news related to Western honey bees (Apis mellifera) and their fluctuating populations globally. Reports on losses of managed honey bee colonies (colonies kept by beekeepers) have been covered by major international news agencies, discussed on the internet and in popular/trade journals, and investigated by scientists around the world. Regarding the latter, there has been a significant increase in the number of refereed publications concerning honey bee diseases, parasitology, and other stressors that may be contributing to colony losses globally. Research dollars have poured into bee laboratories around the world as scientists scramble try to find the "answer" to why bee populations are declining. With a giant spotlight on honey bees, the general public is beginning to understand human reliance on pollinators and the role they play in the global food chain. Yet, many wonder if anything can be done to save a species on which much of agriculture relies. Herein, I discuss the crisis facing the honey bee and what is being done to address this vexing problem. There are roughly 2.6 million managed honey bee colonies in the US and the vast majority of those colonies belong to commercial beekeepers. The definition of commercial beekeeper is somewhat vague, but the term typically refers to an individual who owns/manages 500+ honey bee colonies and whose primary source of income is derived from keeping bees. Unlike in much of the world where a beekeeper's main use of honey bees is to make honey, commercial beekeeping in the US is largely centered on crop pollination at a value of over $14 billion. This involves the movement of honey bee colonies on large trucks around the country (often >3000 km). Farmers who grow crops that need pollination (blueberries, cucumbers, squashes, etc.) pay beekeepers "rent" for their colonies. The beekeepers then place their colonies adjacent to the farmer's crop during the 3-6 week bloom period. Honey bees (and all bees for that matter) have an insatiable appetite for pollen and collect it from flowers and use it as required nutritional support for the production of new bees. The collection of pollen from flowers and movement of that pollen from flower to flower results in a crop that has increased fruit set (i.e. a higher percentage of flowers that produce fruit), larger fruit size, and enhanced fruit quality. Almonds are a driving force in the US honey bee/crop pollination industry. Almond growers recognize that their crops will fail if honey bees are not present during the late winter/early spring bloom. Because of this, almond growers rent bee colonies at a price higher than that offered by growers of any other crop, thus luring beekeepers from around the US to California (where most of the almonds are grown) in February. Due to the value in almond pollination and the unusually early bloom period for a US crop, many US beekeepers overwinter their colonies in southern states to take advantage of favorable winter climates. Colonies can be kept stronger during warm winters and are ready to pollinate almond crops earlier than are colonies in the northern US. © 2012 Research Information Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nosema spp. parasitization decreases the effectiveness of acaricide strips (Apivar <sup>®</sup>) in treating varroosis of honey bee (Apis mellifera iberiensis) colonies	Given the key role played by honey bees in almost all terrestrial ecosystems, maintaining bee populations in adequate sanitary conditions is crucial for these essential pollinators to continue their work. From the beginning of the 21st century, beekeepers have reported a progressive increase in the overwintering mortality of honey bee colonies worldwide. Despite the failure to reach a consensus regarding the cause of this phenomenon, pathogens are thought to be strongly implicated. In the present work, we provide evidence of the negative effects of colony parasitization by Nosema spp. - primarily by N.ceranae- on the effectiveness of acaricide strips to treat Varroa destructor. The effectiveness of the Varroa mite strip treatment (Apivar ®) was greater in colonies in which Nosema spp. parasitization had been controlled. Several studies report that infection by Nosema spp. may affect the behaviour of worker bees. As the effectiveness of Varroa strip treatment depends on bees contacting the strips and their subsequent interaction within the colony, such behavioural and social alterations could interfere with the treatment and allow more severe effects to develop in the colonies infected by Nosema. These results should be considered when assessing acaricide treatments in field conditions due to the high prevalence of both pathogens worldwide. © 2011 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Pesticide exposure in honey bees results in increased levels of the gut pathogen Nosema	Global pollinator declines have been attributed to habitat destruction, pesticide use, and climate change or some combination of these factors, and managed honey bees, Apis mellifera, are part of worldwide pollinator declines. Here we exposed honey bee colonies during three brood generations to sub-lethal doses of a widely used pesticide, imidacloprid, and then subsequently challenged newly emerged bees with the gut parasite, Nosema spp. The pesticide dosages used were below levels demonstrated to cause effects on longevity or foraging in adult honey bees. Nosema infections increased significantly in the bees from pesticide-treated hives when compared to bees from control hives demonstrating an indirect effect of pesticides on pathogen growth in honey bees. We clearly demonstrate an increase in pathogen growth within individual bees reared in colonies exposed to one of the most widely used pesticides worldwide, imidacloprid, at below levels considered harmful to bees. The finding that individual bees with undetectable levels of the target pesticide, after being reared in a sub-lethal pesticide environment within the colony, had higher Nosema is significant. Interactions between pesticides and pathogens could be a major contributor to increased mortality of honey bee colonies, including colony collapse disorder, and other pollinator declines worldwide. © 2012 The Author(s).		imidacloprid, imidazole derivative, nitro derivative, pesticide, climate change, colony structure, dose-response relationship, foraging behavior, honeybee, imidacloprid, infectivity, longevity, mortality, pathogenicity, pollinator, pollution exposure, animal, article, bacterial count, bee, drug effect, microbiology, Nosema, physiology, Animals, Bees, Colony Count, Microbial, Imidazoles, Nitro Compounds, Nosema, Pesticides, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Nosema	2012-02-01
Mechanisms by which pesticides affect insect immunity	The current state of knowledge regarding the effect of pesticides on insect immunity is reviewed here. A basic understanding of these interactions is needed for several reasons, including to improve methods for controlling pest insects in agricultural settings, for controlling insect vectors of human diseases, and for reducing mortality in beneficial insects. Bees are particularly vulnerable to sublethal pesticide exposures because they gather nectar and pollen, concentrating environmental toxins in their nests in the process. Pesticides do have effects on immunity. Organophosphates and some botanicals have been found to impact hemocyte number, differentiation, and thus affect phagocytosis. The phenoloxidase cascade and malanization have also been shown to be affected by several insecticides. Many synthetic insecticides increase oxidative stress, and this could have severe impacts on the production of some antimicrobial peptides in insects, but research is needed to determine the actual effects. Pesticides can also affect grooming behaviors, rendering insects more susceptible to disease. Despite laboratory data documenting pesticide/pathogen interactions, little field data is available at the population level. © 2011.		pesticide, agriculture, animal, animal behavior, drug effect, ecosystem, immunology, innate immunity, insect, insect control, metabolism, oxidative stress, review, Agriculture, Animals, Behavior, Animal, Ecosystem, Immunity, Innate, Insect Control, Insects, Oxidative Stress, Pesticides, Apoidea, Hexapoda	2012-02-01
Identification and comparative analysis of the Eriocheir sinensis microRNA transcriptome response to Spiroplasma eriocheiris infection using a deep sequencing approach	The Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis is one of the most important freshwater aquaculture crustacean species in China. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are important effectors in the intricate host-pathogen interaction network. To increase the repertoire of miRNAs characterized in crustaceans and to examine the relationship between host miRNA expression and pathogen infection, we used the Illumina/Solexa deep sequencing technology to sequence two small RNA libraries prepared from haemocytes of E. sinensis under normal conditions and during infection with Spiroplasma eriocheiris. The high-throughput sequencing resulted in approximately 30,975,151 and 30,826,277 raw reads corresponding to 12,077,088 and 16,271,545 high-quality mappable reads for the normal and infected haemocyte samples, respectively. Bioinformatic analyses identified 735 unique miRNAs, including 36 that are conserved in crustaceans, 134 that are novel to crabs but are present in other arthropods (PN-type), and 565 that are completely new (PC-type). Two hundred twenty-eight unique miRNAs displayed significant differential expression between the normal and infected haemocyte samples (p<0.0001). Of these, 133 (58%) were significantly up-regulated and 95 (42%) were significantly down-regulated upon challenge with S. eriocheiris. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) experiments were preformed for 10 miRNAs of the two samples, and agreement was found between the sequencing and RT-qPCR data. To our knowledge, this is the first report of comprehensive identification of E. sinensis miRNAs and of expression analysis of E. sinensis miRNAs after exposure to S. eriocheiris. Many miRNAs were differentially regulated when exposed to the pathogen, and these findings support the hypothesis that certain miRNAs might be essential in host-pathogen interactions. Our results suggest that elucidation of the molecular mechanisms responsible for miRNA regulation of the host's innate immune system should help with the development of new control strategies to prevent or treat S. eriocheiris infections in crustaceans. © 2011.		microRNA, transcriptome, animal, article, blood cell, Brachyura, high throughput sequencing, immunology, metabolism, microbiology, physiology, Spiroplasma, Animals, Brachyura, Hemocytes, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, MicroRNAs, Spiroplasma, Transcriptome, Arthropoda, Crustacea, Decapoda (Crustacea), Eriocheir sinensis, Spiroplasma	2012-02-01
Multiple routes of pesticide exposure for honey bees living near agricultural fields	Populations of honey bees and other pollinators have declined worldwide in recent years. A variety of stressors have been implicated as potential causes, including agricultural pesticides. Neonicotinoid insecticides, which are widely used and highly toxic to honey bees, have been found in previous analyses of honey bee pollen and comb material. However, the routes of exposure have remained largely undefined. We used LC/MS-MS to analyze samples of honey bees, pollen stored in the hive and several potential exposure routes associated with plantings of neonicotinoid treated maize. Our results demonstrate that bees are exposed to these compounds and several other agricultural pesticides in several ways throughout the foraging period. During spring, extremely high levels of clothianidin and thiamethoxam were found in planter exhaust material produced during the planting of treated maize seed. We also found neonicotinoids in the soil of each field we sampled, including unplanted fields. Plants visited by foraging bees (dandelions) growing near these fields were found to contain neonicotinoids as well. This indicates deposition of neonicotinoids on the flowers, uptake by the root system, or both. Dead bees collected near hive entrances during the spring sampling period were found to contain clothianidin as well, although whether exposure was oral (consuming pollen) or by contact (soil/planter dust) is unclear. We also detected the insecticide clothianidin in pollen collected by bees and stored in the hive. When maize plants in our field reached anthesis, maize pollen from treated seed was found to contain clothianidin and other pesticides; and honey bees in our study readily collected maize pollen. These findings clarify some of the mechanisms by which honey bees may be exposed to agricultural pesticides throughout the growing season. These results have implications for a wide range of large-scale annual cropping systems that utilize neonicotinoid seed treatments. © 2012 Krupke et al.		clothianidin, insecticide, neonicotinoid derivative, pesticide, thiamethoxam, unclassified drug, pesticide residue, talc, agricultural land, article, concentration (parameters), controlled study, cropping system, environmental exposure, foraging behavior, honeybee, liquid chromatography, nonhuman, soil analysis, tandem mass spectrometry, agriculture, animal, bee, chemistry, environmental exposure, flower, maize, pollen, soil, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Zea mays, Agriculture, Animals, Bees, Environmental Exposure, Flowers, Pesticide Residues, Pollen, Soil, Talc, Zea mays	2012-01-03
First report of sacbrood virus in honey bee (apis mellifera) colonies in brazil	Sacbrood disease, an affliction of honey bees (Apis mellifera) characterized by brood that fails to pupate and subsequently dies, is an important threat to honey bee health. The disease is caused by the sacbrood virus (SBV), a positive-, single-stranded RNA virus in the order Picornavirales. Because of the economic importance of honey bees for both pollination and honey production, it is vital to understand and monitor the spread of viruses such as SBV. This virus has been found in many places across the globe, including recently in some South American countries, and it is likely that it will continue to spread. We performed a preliminary study to search for SBV in two apiaries of Africanized honey bees in the State of São Paulo, Brazil, using RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing and found the first evidence of SBV in honey bee colonies in Brazil. The virus was detected in larvae, foraging and nurse bees from two colonies, one of which had symptoms of sacbrood disease, at the beginning of the winter season in June 2011. No SBV was found in samples from nine other nearby colonies. © FUNPEC-RP www.funpecrp.com.br.

Acaricide treatment affects viral dynamics in Varroa destructor-infested honey bee colonies via both host physiology and mite control	Honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies are declining, and a number of stressors have been identified that affect, alone or in combination, the health of honey bees. The ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor, honey bee viruses that are often closely associated with the mite, and pesticides used to control the mite population form a complex system of stressors that may affect honey bee health in different ways. During an acaricide treatment using Apistan (plastic strips coated with tau-fluvalinate), we analyzed the infection dynamics of deformed wing virus (DWV), sacbrood virus (SBV), and black queen cell virus (BQCV) in adult bees, miteinfested pupae, their associated Varroa mites, and uninfested pupae, comparing these to similar samples from untreated control colonies. Titers of DWV increased initially with the onset of the acaricide application and then slightly decreased progressively coinciding with the removal of the Varroa mite infestation. This initial increase in DWV titers suggests a physiological effect of tau-fluvalinate on the host's susceptibility to viral infection. DWV titers in adult bees and uninfested pupae remained higher in treated colonies than in untreated colonies. The titers of SBV and BQCV did not show any direct relationship with mite infestation and showed a variety of possible effects of the acaricide treatment. The results indicate that other factors besides Varroa mite infestation may be important to the development and maintenance of damaging DWV titers in colonies. Possible biochemical explanations for the observed synergistic effects between tau-fluvalinate and virus infections are discussed. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

Evidence for damage-dependent hygienic behaviour towards Varroa destructor-parasitised brood in the western honey bee, Apis mellifera	The ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor and honey bee pathogenic viruses have been implicated in the recent demise of honey bee colonies. Several studies have shown that the combination of V. destructor and deformed wing virus (DWV) poses an especially serious threat to honey bee health. Mites transmitting virulent forms of DWV may cause fatal DWV infections in the developing bee, while pupae parasitised by mites not inducing or activating overt DWV infections may develop normally. Adult bees respond to brood diseases by removing affected brood. This hygienic behaviour is an essential part of the bees' immune response repertoire and is also shown towards mite-parasitised brood. However, it is still unclear whether the bees react towards the mite in the brood cell or rather towards the damage done to the brood. We hypothesised that the extent of mite-associated damage rather than the mere presence of parasitising mites triggers hygienic behaviour. Hygienic behaviour assays performed with mites differing in their potential to transmit overt DWV infections revealed that brood parasitised by 'virulent' mites (i.e. mites with a high potential to induce fatal DWV infections in parasitised pupae) were removed significantly more often than brood parasitised by 'less virulent' mites (i.e. mites with a very low potential to induce overt DWV infections) or non-parasitised brood. Chemical analyses of brood odour profiles suggested that the bees recognise severely affected brood by olfactory cues. Our results suggest that bees show selective, damage-dependent hygienic behaviour, which may be an economic way for colonies to cope with mite infestation. © 2012.

Biodiversity of native bees and crop pollination with emphasis on california	The often-cited estimate that about 30% of our diet depends directly or indirectly on crops pollinated by animals (McGregor 1976) may not hold with more recent and future analyses (Klein et al. 2007). But much of the variety in our diet beyond staples such as wind-pollinated grains depends on animals, especially bees, for pollination. Such pollinator-dependent crops include many fruits (pome, stone), berries (cane, bramble), cucurbits (melons, squashes), nuts (almond, macadamia) and vegetable, oil, and forage crop seeds. Analyses of primary data from 200 countries found that over 75% of 87 globally important food crops (fruits, vegetables, and seeds) are dependent on animal pollination (Klein et al. 2007). These authors state that this represents about 35% of human food production. They also evaluated habitat management for pollination for nine crops and found that intensification of agriculture put wild bees and pollination services at risk. However, analyses of FAO data by Aizen et al. (2008) show similar trends of increased yields in both pollinator-dependent and nondependent crops. They conclude that this does not support the contention that animal-pollinated crops are currently being affected by pollinator shortages at a global scale. However, they warn that if the disproportionate increase in area cultivated with pollinator-dependent crops continues, dependency on services from dwindling pollinator populations will increase in future. © Cambridge University Press 2012.			2012-01-01
Ecotoxicology of organofluorous compounds	Organofluorous compounds have been developed for myriad purposes in a variety of fields, including manufacturing, industry, agriculture, and medicine. The widespread use and application of these compounds has led to increasing concern about their potential ecological toxicity, particularly because of the stability of the C-F bond, which can result in chemical persistence in the environment. This chapter reviews the chemical properties and ecotoxicology of four groups of organofluorous compounds: fluorinated refrigerants and propellants, per-and polyfluorinated compounds (PFCs), fluorinated pesticides, and fluoroquinolone antibiotics. These groups vary in their environmental fate and partitioning, but each raises concern in terms of ecological risk on both the regional and global scale, particularly those compounds with long environmental half-lives. Further research on the occurrence and toxicities of many of these compounds is needed for a more comprehensive understanding of their ecological effects. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.		antiinfective agent, fluorocarbon, pesticide, quinolone derivative, animal, article, ecotoxicology, human, metabolism, methodology, uncertainty, Animals, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Ecotoxicology, Fluorocarbons, Fluoroquinolones, Humans, Pesticides, Uncertainty	2012-01-01
Bees brought to their knees: Microbes affecting honey bee health	The biology and health of the honey bee Apis mellifera has been of interest to human societies for centuries. Research on honey bee health is surging, in part due to new tools and the arrival of colony-collapse disorder (CCD), an unsolved decline in bees from parts of the United States, Europe, and Asia. Although a clear understanding of what causes CCD has yet to emerge, these efforts have led to new microbial discoveries and avenues to improve our understanding of bees and the challenges they face. Here we review the known honey bee microbes and highlight areas of both active and lagging research. Detailed studies of honey bee-pathogen dynamics will help efforts to keep this important pollinator healthy and will give general insights into both beneficial and harmful microbes confronting insect colonies. © 2011.		animal health, Apicomplexa, ascospore, bacterial virulence, bee disease, disease transmission, DNA virus, environmental factor, fungal virulence, heredity, horizontal transmission, microorganism, Microsporidia, molecular dynamics, nonhuman, organism colony, organismal interaction, parasite virulence, pollinator, priority journal, protozoon, review, RNA virus, Trypanosoma, vertical transmission, virus virulence, Amoeba, Animals, Asia, Bacteria, Bees, Colony Collapse, Europe, Fungi, United States, Viruses, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hexapoda	2011-12-01
Risk analysis in animal health caused by the presence of hydroxymethylfurfural in syrup for honey bee feeding	This paper discusses an incident that occurred in Belgium during winter 2009-2010, after which many honey bee colonies have been lost. Later analyses showed that these colonies had been fed during the winter with a inverted sugar syrup from sugar beet which had a high concentration of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). HMF concentrations ranged from 18.8ppm to 365.6ppm. Data from the scientific literature are quite limited, but several authors confirm the harmful effect of HMF on honey bee health. Other elements, however, may have played a role in this apparent mortality such as crystallization of syrups, resulting in unavailability of sugar for the honey bees, and thus the death of them from starvation. Pending the acquisition of new scientific knowledge on the subject, it is recommended to follow good beekeeping practices detailed in this article to minimize the formation of HMF in syrups for honey bee feeding. In addition, a draft action limit corresponding to a maximal concentration of 40ppm of HMF is proposed in order to control the risk at the producer and distributor of syrups for honey bee feeding level.

Biotechnology helps in improvement of environment	This review gives an insight into the recent advancements in biotechnology with respect to its application in the environment. Particular emphasis is on food production, pollution control and bio energy production. Environmental biotechnology combines molecular biology and cell manipulation in order to produce valuable products with a lot of new, effective and acceptable properties. Global food security (good quality food, disease resistant varieties of cereal crops), use of genetic engineering to minimize pollution and plants as a source of energy, are possible by the careful use of biotechnological techniques. In the coming future biotechnology will become major driving force in the field of environment, beneficial both for underdeveloped and developed countries. © IDOSI Publications, 2011.			2011-12-01
Detection of pesticides in active and depopulated beehives in uruguay	The influence of insecticides commonly used for agricultural purposes on beehive depopulation in Uruguay was investigated. Honeycombs, bees, honey and propolis from depopulated hives were analyzed for pesticide residues, whereas from active beehives only honey and propolis were evaluated. A total of 37 samples were analyzed, representing 14,800 beehives. In depopulated beehives only imidacloprid and fipronil were detected and in active beehives endosulfan, coumaphos, cypermethrin, ethion and chlorpyrifos were found. Coumaphos was present in the highest concentrations, around 1,000 μg/kg, in all the propolis samples from active beehives. Regarding depopulated beehives, the mean levels of imidacloprid found in honeycomb (377 μg/kg, Standard Deviation: 118) and propolis (60 μg/kg, Standard Deviation: 57) are higher than those described to produce bee disorientation and fipronil levels detected in bees (150 and 170 μg/kg) are toxic per se. The other insecticides found can affect the global fitness of the bees causing weakness and a decrease in their overall productivity. These preliminary results suggest that bees exposed to pesticides or its residues can lead them in different ways to the beehive. © 2011 by the authors.		chlorpyrifos, cipermethrin, coumafos, endosulfan, ethion, fipronil, imidacloprid, insecticide, organochlorine insecticide, organophosphate insecticide, propolis, pyrethroid, article, bee, concentration (parameters), controlled study, honey, insect control, insecticidal activity, LD 50, limit of detection, limit of quantitation, lipophilicity, nonhuman, population productivity, reproductive fitness, residue analysis, Uruguay, Animals, Bees, Chromatography, Gas, Chromatography, Gel, Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid, Colony Collapse, Environmental Monitoring, Honey, Insecticides, Limit of Detection, Pesticide Residues, Propolis, Uruguay, Apoidea	2011-11-03
Killing them with kindness? in-hive medications may inhibit xenobiotic efflux transporters and endanger honey bees	Background: Honey bees (Apis mellifera) have recently experienced higher than normal overwintering colony losses. Many factors have been evoked to explain the losses, among which are the presence of residues of pesticides and veterinary products in hives. Multiple residues are present at the same time, though most often in low concentrations so that no single product has yet been associated with losses. Involvement of a combination of residues to losses may however not be excluded. To understand the impact of an exposure to combined residues on honey bees, we propose a mechanism-based strategy, focusing here on Multi-Drug Resistance (MDR) transporters as mediators of those interactions. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using whole-animal bioassays, we demonstrate through inhibition by verapamil that the widely used organophosphate and pyrethroid acaricides coumaphos and τ-fluvalinate, and three neonicotinoid insecticides: imidacloprid, acetamiprid and thiacloprid are substrates of one or more MDR transporters. Among the candidate inhibitors of honey bee MDR transporters is the in-hive antibiotic oxytetracycline. Bees prefed oxytetracycline were significantly sensitized to the acaricides coumaphos and τ-fluvalinate, suggesting that the antibiotic may interfere with the normal excretion or metabolism of these pesticides. Conclusions/Significance: Many bee hives receive regular treatments of oxytetracycline and acaricides for prevention and treatment of disease and parasites. Our results suggest that seasonal co-application of these medicines to bee hives could increase the adverse effects of these and perhaps other pesticides. Our results also demonstrate the utility of a mechanism-based strategy. By identifying pesticides and apicultural medicines that are substrates and inhibitors of xenobiotic transporters we prioritize the testing of those chemical combinations most likely to result in adverse interactions. © 2011 Hawthorne, Dively.		acetamiprid, coumafos, fluvalinate, glycoprotein P, imidacloprid, insecticide, organophosphate, oxytetracycline, thiacloprid, unclassified drug, verapamil, carrier protein, oxytetracycline, verapamil, xenobiotic agent, article, bioassay, chemical interaction, controlled study, drug exposure, drug potentiation, environmental exposure, honeybee, nonhuman, protein analysis, protein targeting, residue analysis, seasonal variation, toxicity testing, animal, bee, drug antagonism, endangered species, metabolism, multidrug resistance, Animalia, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Animals, Bees, Carrier Proteins, Drug Resistance, Multiple, Endangered Species, Oxytetracycline, Verapamil, Xenobiotics	2011-11-02
Evidence for emerging parasites and pathogens influencing outbreaks of stress-related diseases like chalkbrood	In agriculture, honey bees play a critical role as commercial pollinators of crop monocultures which depend on insect pollination. Hence, the demise of honey bee colonies in Europe, USA, and Asia caused much concern and initiated many studies and research programmes aiming at elucidating the factors negatively affecting honey bee health and survival. Most of these studies look at individual factors related to colony losses. In contrast, we here present our data on the interaction of pathogens and parasites in honey bee colonies. We performed a longitudinal cohort study over 6 years by closely monitoring 220 honey bee colonies kept in 22 apiaries (ten randomly selected colonies per apiary). Observed winter colony losses varied between 4.8% and 22.4%; lost colonies were replaced to ensure a constant number of monitored colonies over the study period. Data on mite infestation levels, infection with viruses, Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae, and recorded outbreaks of chalkbrood were continuously collected. We now provide statistical evidence (i) that Varroa destructor infestation in summer is related to DWV infections in autumn, (ii) that V. destructor infestation in autumn is related to N. apis infection in the following spring, and most importantly (iii) that chalkbrood outbreaks in summer are related to N. ceranae infection in the preceding spring and to V. destructor infestation in the same season. These highly significant links between emerging parasites/pathogens and established pathogens need further experimental proof but they already illustrate the complexity of the host-pathogen-interactions in honey bee colonies. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.		animal, animal disease, apiculture, article, bee, communicable disease, environmental monitoring, epidemic, host pathogen interaction, immunology, microbiology, microsporidiosis, mite infestation, Nosema, parasitology, pathogenicity, physiological stress, season, Varroidae, Animals, Beekeeping, Bees, Communicable Diseases, Emerging, Disease Outbreaks, Environmental Monitoring, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Microsporidiosis, Mite Infestations, Nosema, Seasons, Stress, Physiological, Varroidae, Acari, Apis mellifera, Deformed wing virus, Hexapoda, Nosema, Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2011-11-01
An emerging paradigm of colony health: Microbial balance of the honey bee and hive (Apis mellifera)	Across the globe, honey bee populations have been declining at an unprecedented rate. Managed honey bees are highly social, frequent a multitude of environmental niches, and continually share food, conditions that promote the transmission of parasites and pathogens. Additionally, commercial honey bees used in agriculture are stressed by crowding and frequent transport, and exposed to a plethora of agricultural chemicals and their associated byproducts. When considering this problem, the hive of the honey bee may be best characterized as an extended organism that not only houses developing young and nutrient rich food stores, but also serves as a niche for symbiotic microbial communities that aid in nutrition and defend against pathogens. The niche requirements and maintenance of beneficial honey bee symbionts are largely unknown, as are the ways in which such communities contribute to honey bee nutrition, immunity, and overall health. In this review, we argue that the honey bee should be viewed as a model system to examine the effect of microbial communities on host nutrition and pathogen defense. A systems view focused on the interaction of the honey bee with its associated microbial community is needed to understand the growing agricultural challenges faced by this economically important organism. The road to sustainable honey bee pollination may eventually require the detoxification of agricultural systems, and in the short term, the integrated management of honey bee microbial systems. © 2011 International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI) (outside the USA).		agricultural management, agrochemical, apiculture, colony, commercial species, detoxification, disease resistance, ecosystem health, honeybee, host-pathogen interaction, immunity, microbial community, microbial ecology, niche, parasite transmission, pollination, population decline, social insect, sustainability, symbiont, symbiosis, Apis mellifera, Hexapoda	2011-11-01
Analysis of mortality in africanized honey bee colonies with high levels of infestation Varroa destructor	The mite Varroa destructor (Anderson & Treuman 2000) is one of the world's most important plagues of apiculture. In Brazil this mite does not encounter good conditions for parasitism because weather conditions are not ideal for its maintenance, and some strains of Africanized honey bees are resistant to the parasite. This status is reflected in the low number of dead colonies caused by varroatosis and also the stability of infestation levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the damage caused by mite infestations in hives with higher levels of infestation than the ones considered normal for Brazilian apiaries. The level of infestation in each colony was determined and the mortality rates of parasitized bees during development were periodically recorded. The G Test of Independence and a Test of Proportions were used to compare the data. The rates of mortality of pupae and larvae were mostly proportional to the level of infestation in each colony. All colonies showed mortality rates significantly higher than the control one. In Africanized honeybee colonies with high rates of infestation by Varroa destructor mortality rates varied from 19.27% to 23.28% in pupae ( X = 21.27%) and from 15.71% to 16.15% in larvae {X = 15.93%), against 3.85% and 3.74% in the control colony, respectively. In the parasitized colonies the average rates of mortality caused by the hurtful effects of the mite were, respectively, 5.52 and 4.26 times greater in those two developmental stages. Thus it can be concluded that even in tropical regions, like Brazil, it is necessary to give special attention to the levels of mite infestation (IR), particularly where the IR tends to be higher.			2011-10-21
Nutrigenomics in honey bees: Digital gene expression analysis of pollen's nutritive effects on healthy and varroa-parasitized bees	Background: Malnutrition is a major factor affecting animal health, resistance to disease and survival. In honey bees (Apis mellifera), pollen, which is the main dietary source of proteins, amino acids and lipids, is essential to adult bee physiological development while reducing their susceptibility to parasites and pathogens. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying pollen's nutritive impact on honey bee health remained to be determined. For that purpose, we investigated the influence of pollen nutrients on the transcriptome of worker bees parasitized by the mite Varroa destructor, known for suppressing immunity and decreasing lifespan. The 4 experimental groups (control bees without a pollen diet, control bees fed with pollen, varroa-parasitized bees without a pollen diet and varroa-parasitized bees fed with pollen) were analyzed by performing a digital gene expression (DGE) analysis on bee abdomens.Results: Around 36, 000 unique tags were generated per DGE-tag library, which matched about 8, 000 genes (60% of the genes in the honey bee genome). Comparing the transcriptome of bees fed with pollen and sugar and bees restricted to a sugar diet, we found that pollen activates nutrient-sensing and metabolic pathways. In addition, those nutrients had a positive influence on genes affecting longevity and the production of some antimicrobial peptides. However, varroa parasitism caused the development of viral populations and a decrease in metabolism, specifically by inhibiting protein metabolism essential to bee health. This harmful effect was not reversed by pollen intake.Conclusions: The DGE-tag profiling methods used in this study proved to be a powerful means for analyzing transcriptome variation related to nutrient intake in honey bees. Ultimately, with such an approach, applying genomics tools to nutrition research, nutrigenomics promises to offer a better understanding of how nutrition influences body homeostasis and may help reduce the susceptibility of bees to (less virulent) pathogens. © 2011 Alaux et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.		transcriptome, vitellogenin, antimicrobial cationic peptide, carbohydrate, target of rapamycin kinase, article, controlled study, digital gene expression analysis, down regulation, gene expression profiling, gene expression regulation, gene function, gene number, honeybee, lipid metabolism, nonhuman, nucleotide sequence, nutrigenomics, oxidative phosphorylation, parasitism, pollen, protein degradation, protein metabolism, sugar intake, upregulation, Varroa, virus virulence, abdomen, animal, bee, genetics, immunology, longevity, metabolism, parasitology, physiology, pollen, signal transduction, Varroidae, Acari, Animalia, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Varroa, Varroa destructor, Abdomen, Animals, Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides, Bees, Carbohydrates, Longevity, Nutrigenomics, Pollen, Signal Transduction, TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases, Transcriptome, Varroidae	2011-10-10
Polar tube protein gene diversity among Nosema ceranae strains derived from a Greek honey bee health study	Honey bee samples from 54 apiaries originating from 37 geographic locations of Greece were screened for Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae. Furthermore 15 samples coming from 12 geographic locations were screened also for Paenibacillus larvae and Melissococcus plutonius and seven honey bee virus species, for the first time on a nation-wide level. There was a tendency in finding proportionally higher spore counts in samples from apiaries that suffered important colony losses. P. larvae bacteria were identified in two samples and each of the tested bee viruses could be detected in at least one of the examined samples, with IAPV, CBPV and SBV being the least abundant and BQCV and DWV being the most abundant. In the study we focused on polymorphism of a N. ceranae gene encoding a polar tube protein (PTP) as similar genes were proven to be highly polymorphic in the microsporidian parasites Encephalitozoon cuniculi and Encephalitozoon hellem. The polymorphism observed in the PTP gene sequences from a single sample (bee hive) was unexpected and can thus be considered to be a major obstacle for genotyping. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.		fungal DNA, fungal protein, animal, animal disease, article, bee, environmental monitoring, genetic polymorphism, genetic variability, genetics, Greece, host pathogen interaction, microbiology, mycosis, Nosema, species difference, Animals, Bees, DNA, Fungal, Environmental Monitoring, Fungal Proteins, Genetic Variation, Greece, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Mycoses, Nosema, Polymorphism, Genetic, Species Specificity, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Bacteria (microorganisms), Chronic bee paralysis virus, Deformed wing virus, Encephalitozoon, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, Encephalitozoon hellem, Melissococcus plutonius, Microsporidia, Nosema, Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae, Paenibacillus, Paenibacillus larvae	2011-10-01
Susceptibility of Varroa destructor (Gamasida: Varroidae) to four pesticides used in three Mexican apicultural regions under two different management systems	Mexico has five apicultural regions wich are defined according to their blooming period and geography. Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman is controlled with pesticides and alternative treatments in all these regions. To determine the concentration-mortality response lines of V. destructor, bioassays with four pesticides that are used for its control in the Gulf of Mexico, Yucatan Peninsula and Central-Highland regions were conducted. The Burgerjon spraying tower was used to apply known concentrations of flumethrin, fluvalinate, amitraz and coumaphos. Lethal concentrations 50 (LC50) and resistance indexes were calculated with Probit analyses. In the Gulf region, the resistance indexes were: flumethrin, 659.43; fluvalinate, 21.83; amitraz, 12.77; coumaphos, 1.49×. In the Central-Highland region: flumethrin, 243.43; fluvalinate, 19.04; amitraz, 8.56; coumaphos, 1.22 x. In the Yucatan Peninsula region: flumethrin, 4057.32; fluvalinate, 199.57; amitraz, 26.55; coumaphos, 3.93×. These results suggest a resistance to flumethrin, fluvalinate and amitraz, with similar values in migratory beekeeping regions, and higher values in the non-migratory region. Coumaphos remained effective in V. destructor populations of the Gulf and Central-Highland regions. © 2011 Taylor &Francis.		Apis mellifera, Gamasida, Varroa, Varroa destructor, Varroidae	2011-10-01
An exposure study to assess the potential impact of fipronil in treated sunflower seeds on honey bee colony losses in Spain	Background: There is great concern about the high losses and strong depopulation of honey bee colonies in some areas of Spain. Some beekeepers have suggested that sunflower seeds treated with the insecticide fipronil could be an important factor in causing those losses. Therefore, an in-depth field study has been carried out in two regions of Spain where sunflower production is intense (Cuenca and Andalucía) and where, for some crops and varieties, fipronil has been used as seed insecticide. RESULTS: Samples of adult bees and pollen were analysed for bee pathogens and pesticide residues respectively. Neither fipronil residues nor its metabolites were detected in any of the samples analysed, indicating that short-term or chronic exposure of bees to fipronil and/or its metabolites can be ruled out in the apiaries surveyed. Varroa destructor and Nosema ceranae were found to be very prevalent. CONCLUSION: The combination of the two pathogens could augment the risk of colony death in infected colonies, without fipronil residues exerting a significant effect in the given field conditions. Indeed, in this study the losses observed in apiaries located close to sunflower crops were similar to those in apiaries situated in forested areas with wild vegetation. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.		fipronil, insecticide, pesticide residue, pyrazole derivative, adult, assessment method, colony structure, environmental factor, forest ecosystem, fungus, habitat loss, herb, honeybee, inhibitor, insecticide, metabolite, observational method, pathogenicity, pollen, pollution exposure, population structure, seed, survey, vegetation structure, animal, article, bee, chemistry, parasitology, plant seed, pollen, Spain, sunflower, weather, Animals, Bees, Helianthus, Insecticides, Pesticide Residues, Pollen, Pyrazoles, Seeds, Spain, Weather, Spain, Andalucia, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Helianthus, Nosema, Nosema ceranae, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2011-10-01
Our dying planet: An ecologist's view of the crisis we face	Coral reefs are on track to become the first ecosystem actually eliminated from the planet. So says leading ecologist Peter F. Sale in this crash course on the state of the planet. Sale draws from his own extensive work on coral reefs, and from recent research by other ecologists, to explore the many ways we are changing the earth and to explain why it matters. Weaving into the narrative his own firsthand field experiences around the world, Sale brings ecology alive while giving a solid understanding of the science at work behind today's pressing environmental issues. He delves into topics including overfishing, deforestation, biodiversity loss, use of fossil fuels, population growth, and climate change while discussing the real consequences of our growing ecological footprint. Most important, this passionately written book emphasizes that a gloom-and-doom scenario is not inevitable, and as Sale explores alternative paths, he considers the ways in which science can help us realize a better future. © 2011 by The Regents of the University of California.			2011-09-12
Consequences of uncertainty in global-scale land cover maps for mapping ecosystem functions: An analysis of pollination efficiency	Mapping ecosystem services (ESs) is an important tool for providing the quantitative information necessary for the optimal use and protection of ecosystems and biodiversity. A common mapping approach is to apply established empirical relationships to ecosystem property maps. Often, ecosystem properties that provide services to humanity are strongly related to the land use and land cover, where the spatial allocation of the land cover in the landscape is especially important. Land use and land cover maps are, therefore, essential for ES mapping. However, insight into the uncertainties in land cover maps and how these propagate into ES maps is lacking. To analyze the effects of these uncertainties, we mapped pollination efficiency as an example of an ecosystem function, using two continental-scale land cover maps and two global-scale land cover maps. We compared the outputs with maps based on a detailed national-scale map. The ecosystem properties and functions could be mapped using the GLOBCOVER map with a reasonable to good accuracy. In homogeneous landscapes, an even coarser resolution map would suffice. For mapping ESs that depend on the spatial allocation of land cover in the landscape, a classification of satellite images using fractional land cover or mosaic classes is an asset. © 2011 by the authors.

Determination of coumaphos, chlorpyrifos and ethion residues in propolis tinctures by matrix solid-phase dispersion and gas chromatography coupled to flame photometric and mass spectrometric detection	A new analytical method has been developed and successfully evaluated in routine application for the quantitative analysis of a selected group of organophosphate pesticides (coumaphos, chlorpyrifos and ethion) which can be found at trace levels in propolis tinctures (ethanolic propolis extracts); a valuable commodity used as raw material in the food and pharmaceutical industries for which there have been few attempts for pesticide residue analysis reported in the literature. The proposed methodology is based on matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD) using aluminum sulfate anh. a novel dispersant material and subsequent column chromatography clean-up in silica gel prior to gas chromatography (GC) with both flame photometric detector (FPD) and mass spectrometry (MS) detection used for the routine quantification and identification of the residues, respectively. The limits of detection, for coumaphos, chlorpyrifos and ethion were below 26.0μg/kg in FPD and 1.43μg/kg for MS detection. Mean recoveries were in the range of 85-123% with RSD values below 13%, which suggests that the proposed method is fit for the purpose of analyzing pesticides in propolis tinctures containing high concentration of polyphenolics. The method has been successfully applied in our laboratory for the last 2 year in the analysis of real propolis tinctures samples. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

CYP9Q-mediated detoxification of acaricides in the honey bee (Apis mellifera)	Although Apis mellifera, the western honey bee, has long encountered pesticides when foraging in agricultural fields, for two decades it has encountered pesticides in-hive in the form of acaricides to control Varroa destructor, a devastating parasitic mite. The pyrethroid tau-fluvalinate and the organophosphate coumaphos have been used for Varroa control, with little knowledge of honey bee detoxification mechanisms. Cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification contributes to pyrethroid tolerance in many insects, but specific P450s responsible for pesticide detoxification in honey bees (indeed, in any hymenopteran pollinator) have not been defined. We expressed and assayed CYP3 clan midgut P450s and demonstrated that CYP9Q1, CYP9Q2, and CYP9Q3 metabolize tau-fluvalinate to a form suitable for further cleavage by the carboxylesterases that also contribute to tau-fluvalinate tolerance. These in vitro assays indicated that all of the three CYP9Q enzymes also detoxify coumaphos. Molecular models demonstrate that coumaphos and tau-fluvalinate fit into the same catalytic pocket, providing a possible explanation for the synergism observed between these two compounds. Induction of CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3 transcripts by honey extracts suggested that diet-derived phytochemicals may be natural substrates and heterologous expression of CYP9Q3 confirmed activity against quercetin, a flavonoid ubiquitous in honey. Up-regulation by honey constituents suggests that diet may influence the ability of honey bees to detoxify pesticides. Quantitative RT-PCR assays demonstrated that tau-fluvalinate enhances CYP9Q3 transcripts, whereas the pyrethroid bifenthrin enhances CYP9Q1 and CYP9Q2 transcripts and represses CYP9Q3 transcripts. The independent regulation of these P450s can be useful for monitoring and differentiating between pesticide exposures in-hive and in agricultural fields.		carboxylesterase, coumafos, cytochrome P450, cytochrome P450 9Q1, cytochrome P450 9Q2, cytochrome P450 9Q3, fluvalinate, pyrethroid, quercetin, unclassified drug, article, catalysis, controlled study, drug detoxification, enzyme active site, honeybee, in vitro study, midgut, molecular docking, molecular model, molecular recognition, nonhuman, phytochemistry, priority journal, quantitative assay, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Varroa, Acaricides, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Bees, Coumaphos, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic, Host-Parasite Interactions, Insect Proteins, Insecticides, Isoenzymes, Metabolic Detoxication, Drug, Models, Molecular, Molecular Sequence Data, Molecular Structure, Nitriles, Phylogeny, Protein Binding, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Pyrethrins, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, Sequence Homology, Amino Acid, Varroidae, Acari, Apidae, Apis mellifera, Hexapoda, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2011-08-02
Asynchronous development of honey bee host and varroa destructor (Mesostigmata: Varroidae) influences reproductive potential of mites	A high proportion of nonreproductive (NR) Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman (Mesostigmata: Varroidae), is commonly observed in honey bee colonies displaying the varroa sensitive hygienic trait (VSH). This study was conducted to determine the influence of brood removal and subsequent host reinvasion of varroa mites on mite reproduction. We collected foundress mites from stages of brood (newly sealed larvae, prepupae, white-eyed pupae, and pink-eyed pupae) and phoretic mites from adult bees. We then inoculated these mites into cells containing newly sealed larvae. Successful reproduction (foundress laid both a mature male and female) was low (13%) but most common in mites coming from sealed larvae. Unsuccessful reproductive attempts (foundress failed to produce both a mature male and female) were most common in mites from sealed larvae (22%) and prepupae (61%). Lack of any progeny was most common for mites from white-eyed (83%) and pink-eyed pupae (92%). We also collected foundress mites from sealed larvae and transferred them to cells containing newly sealed larvae, prepupae, white-eyed pupae, or pink-eyed pupae. Successful reproduction only occurred in the transfers to sealed larvae (26%). Unsuccessful reproductive attempts were most common in transfers to newly sealed larvae (40%) and to prepupae (25%). Unsuccessful attempts involved the production of immature progeny (60%), the production of only mature daughters (26%) or the production of only a mature male (14%). Generally, lack of progeny was not associated with mites having a lack of stored sperm. Our results suggest that mites exposed to the removal of prepupae or older brood due to hygiene are unlikely to produce viable mites if they invade new hosts soon after brood removal. Asynchrony between the reproductive status of reinvading mites and the developmental stage of their reinvasion hosts may be a primary cause of NR mites in hygienic colonies. Even if reinvading mites use hosts having the proper age for infestation, only a minority of them will reproduce. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.		animal, article, bee, cytology, female, growth, development and aging, host parasite interaction, male, parasitology, reproduction, spermatozoon, Varroidae, Animals, Bees, Female, Host-Parasite Interactions, Male, Reproduction, Spermatozoa, Varroidae, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Mesostigmata, Varroa, Varroa destructor, Varroidae	2011-08-01
Epizootic status of apiaries with massive losses of bee colonies (2008-2009)	In 2008 and 2009, winter bee colony mortality in apiaries showed losses which ranged from 30% to 100%. Analyses of tests results obtained from 1000 colonies (from 142 apiaries) were performed to determine the impact of pathogens on the winter bee colony mortality in apiaries. Relationships between individual pathogens were also determined. Dead bees were sampled separately from an average of 7 colonies in each apiary, and the presence of V. destructor, Nosema spp. and viruses: ABPV, CBPV, IAPV, DWV was detected. Co-infection with 3 or 4 pathogens was detected in over 60% of bee colonies. Infestation of V. destructor was found in 88.7% of the colonies while infection of deformed wing virus (DWV) in 76%. A similar number of colonies (74%) were infected with Nosema spp. parasites. Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) was detected in 35% of the examined colonies and chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) was found in only 7,8% of the colonies. The level of Varroa destructor and Nosema spp. infestation was high (averaged 192 mites per sample and 18 million Nosema spores per bee). Severe colony losses in examined apiaries could be attributed to the wide prevalence of V. destructor with DWV and ABPV infections, and/or Nosema spp. infestation. Losses can also be attributed to the co-occurrence of these pathogens in bee colonies and their total negative impact on the bees.

Effects of natural infestations of the mite Varroa, destructor on the development of Africanized honeybee workers (Apis mellifera)	The mite Varroa destructor (Anderson & Treuman 2000) has caused extensive damage to beekeeping worldwide. In Brazil, weather conditions and the strains of bees do not provide ideal conditions for mite parasitism, which is reflected in the low number of deaths of colonies caused by varroatosis well as the stability of infestation levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the damage caused by the mite infestation in hives maintained in natural conditions. For this purpose the number of mites per bee was calculated and used to quantify the level of infestation in each colony. To record the mortality rates of parasitized bees during development daily checks were performed. The data were analyzed by G test of independence and a Test of Proportions. The results indicate that the rate of mortality of pupae and larvae was proportional to the degree of infestation in each colony, and all colonies showed mortality rates significantly higher than the control rate. A significant interaction among death rates recorded between the third and fourth days of larval life and the total death of larvae was found (G Test - 50.22; P < 0.0001). So, it can be concluded that bee inbreeding contributed significantly to the increase of the larval rate of mortality. In Africanized honeybee colonies infested by the mite Varroa destructor mortality rates in conditions of natural infestation varied from 6.65 to 9.89% in pupae (x̄= 8.78%) and from 6.13 to 13.48% in larvae ( x̄ = 9.91%), against 3.85% and 3.74% in the control colony, respectively. Therefore, in the infested colonies the average rates of mortality caused by the harmful effects of the mite were, respectively, 2.28 times and 2.65 times greater in those two developmental stages.

The influence of pulverised sugar dusting on the degree of infestation of honey bee colonies with Varroa destructor	The aim of this work was the investigation on the efficacy of pulverised sugar dusting on knocking-down Varroa destructor mites and the influence of the dynamics of the treatment on the degree of infestation in honey bee colonies. Two methods were deployed to measure the degree of infestation of bee colonies with V. destructor mites: the sugar shake method and the technique which involves mesh bottom boards equipped with sticky inserts. The research was carried out on 30 strong honey bee colonies in three successive years. The results proved that dusting with pulverised sugar (particle diameter below 40 μm) influenced the fall of V. destructor in comparison with both their fall off prior to the treatment and the negative control. The most discernible effects on the mite fall and the decline in their population in the hives was obtained with dustings repeated at threeday intervals. To conclude, the dynamics of the treatment affected the degree of infestation in bee colonies. However, the efficacy of sugar dusting was significantly lower in comparison with the one of flumethrin (positive control). Thus, in spite of considerable favourable effects on the decline in the degree of infestation with mites, by no means may dusting with pulverised sugar be advised to beekeepers as the one and only means of bee protection against V. destructor. The use of the technique which involves mesh bottom boards equipped with sticky inserts proved more efficacious and sensitive in the judgment of the degree of infestation of bee colonies in comparison with the sugar shake method, which includes dusting 300 bees with 40 g of pulverised sugar (particle diameter below 40 μm).

Exposure to sublethal doses of fipronil and thiacloprid highly increases mortality of honeybees previously infected by nosema ceranae	Background: The honeybee, Apis mellifera, is undergoing a worldwide decline whose origin is still in debate. Studies performed for twenty years suggest that this decline may involve both infectious diseases and exposure to pesticides. Joint action of pathogens and chemicals are known to threaten several organisms but the combined effects of these stressors were poorly investigated in honeybees. Our study was designed to explore the effect of Nosema ceranae infection on honeybee sensitivity to sublethal doses of the insecticides fipronil and thiacloprid. Methodology/Finding: Five days after their emergence, honeybees were divided in 6 experimental groups: (i) uninfected controls, (ii) infected with N. ceranae, (iii) uninfected and exposed to fipronil, (iv) uninfected and exposed to thiacloprid, (v) infected with N. ceranae and exposed 10 days post-infection (p.i.) to fipronil, and (vi) infected with N. ceranae and exposed 10 days p.i. to thiacloprid. Honeybee mortality and insecticide consumption were analyzed daily and the intestinal spore content was evaluated 20 days after infection. A significant increase in honeybee mortality was observed when N. ceranae-infected honeybees were exposed to sublethal doses of insecticides. Surprisingly, exposures to fipronil and thiacloprid had opposite effects on microsporidian spore production. Analysis of the honeybee detoxification system 10 days p.i. showed that N. ceranae infection induced an increase in glutathione-S-transferase activity in midgut and fat body but not in 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase activity. Conclusions/Significance: After exposure to sublethal doses of fipronil or thiacloprid a higher mortality was observed in N. ceranae-infected honeybees than in uninfected ones. The synergistic effect of N. ceranae and insecticide on honeybee mortality, however, did not appear strongly linked to a decrease of the insect detoxification system. These data support the hypothesis that the combination of the increasing prevalence of N. ceranae with high pesticide content in beehives may contribute to colony depopulation. © 2011 Vidau et al.		7 ethoxycoumarin deethylase, fipronil, glutathione transferase, insecticide, thiacloprid, unclassified drug, fipronil, pyrazole derivative, pyridine derivative, thiacloprid, thiazine derivative, animal experiment, article, bee disease, controlled study, detoxification, enzyme activity, experimental infection, fat body, honeybee, LD 50, Microsporidia, midgut, mortality, nonhuman, Nosema, nosemosis, sporogenesis, animal, bee, drug effect, microbiology, Nosema, pathogenicity, Apis mellifera, Hexapoda, Nosema ceranae, Animals, Bees, Insecticides, Nosema, Pyrazoles, Pyridines, Thiazines	2011-07-01
A use-dependent sodium current modification induced by type I pyrethroid insecticides in honeybee antennal olfactory receptor neurons	We studied the mode of action of type I pyrethroids on the voltage-dependent sodium current from honeybee olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), whose proper function in antenna is crucial for interindividual communication in this species. Under voltage-clamp, tetramethrin and permethrin induce a long lasting TTX-sensitive tail current upon repolarization, which is the hallmark of an abnormal prolongation of the open channel configuration. Permethrin and tetramethrin also slow down the sodium current fast inactivation. Tetramethrin and permethrin both bind to the closed state of the channel as suggested by the presence of an obvious tail current after the first single depolarization applied in the presence of either compounds. Moreover, at first sight, channel opening seems to promote tetramethrin and permethrin binding as evidenced by the progressive tail current summation along with trains of stimulations, tetramethrin being more potent at modifying channels than permethrin. However, a use-dependent increase in the sodium peak current along with stimulations suggests that the tail current accumulation could also be a consequence of progressively unmasked silent channels. Experiments with the sea anemone toxin ATX-II that suppresses sodium channels fast inactivation are consistent with the hypothesis that these silent channels are either in an inactivated state at rest, or that they normally inactivate before they open so that they do not participate to the control sodium current. In honeybee ORNs, three processes lead to a use-dependent pyrethroid-induced tail current accumulation: (i) a recruitment of silent channels that produces an increase in the peak sodium current, (ii) a slowing down of the sodium current inactivation produced by prolongation of channels opening and (iii) a typical deceleration in current deactivation. The use-dependent recruitment of silent sodium channels in honeybee ORNs makes pyrethroids more potent at modifying neuronal excitability. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.		permethrin, pyrethroid, sea anemone toxin, sodium channel, tetramethrin, animal cell, animal tissue, antenna (organ), article, binding site, brain electrophysiology, channel gating, controlled study, honeybee, membrane depolarization, nonhuman, olfactory receptor, priority journal, repolarization, scanning electron microscopy, sodium current, steady state, voltage clamp, Animals, Arthropod Antennae, Bees, Cnidarian Venoms, Insecticides, Ion Channel Gating, Kinetics, Least-Squares Analysis, Membrane Potentials, Models, Biological, Models, Statistical, Olfactory Receptor Neurons, Patch-Clamp Techniques, Permethrin, Pyrethrins, Sodium, Sodium Channel Blockers, Sodium Channels, Tetrodotoxin, Actiniaria, Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2011-06-01
The potential impacts of insecticides on the life-history traits of bees and the consequences for pollination	Maintaining the relationships between plants and pollinators is vital to ecosystem stability. Insecticides may disturb these interactions with poorly understood consequences for pollination. Community level research is essential, if we are to understand the wider effects of insecticides on a variety of pollinating taxa and the impacts on the plants they pollinate. In this article we discuss the potential effects of both the lethal and sub-lethal impacts of insecticide use in agro-ecosystems on pollination services by bees. In particular, we consider how particular life-history traits of pollinators, such as sociality and floral specialisation may be differentially affected by insecticides. We discuss how this might translate through to pollination services. We propose that a trait-based approach can give insight into the potential impacts of insecticides on plant-pollinator communities. © 2010 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.		Apoidea	2011-06-01
Social immunity in honeybees (Apis mellifera): Transcriptome analysis of varroa-hygienic behaviour	Honeybees have evolved a social immunity consisting of the cooperation of individuals to decrease disease in the hive. We identified a set of genes involved in this social immunity by analysing the brain transcriptome of highly varroa-hygienic bees, who efficiently detect and remove brood infected with the Varroa destructor mite. The function of these candidate genes does not seem to support a higher olfactory sensitivity in hygienic bees, as previously hypothesized. However, comparing their genomic profile with those from other behaviours suggests a link with brood care and the highly varroa-hygienic Africanized honeybees. These results represent a first step toward the identification of genes involved in social immunity and thus provide first insights into the evolution of social immunity. © 2011 The Authors Insect Molecular Biology © 2011 The Royal Entomological Society.		animal, animal communication, article, bee, brain, gene expression profiling, genetics, immunology, metabolism, parasitology, social behavior, Varroidae, Animal Communication, Animals, Bees, Brain, Gene Expression Profiling, Social Behavior, Varroidae, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apis mellifera scutellata, Apoidea, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2011-06-01
Rapid determination of fumagillin residues in honey by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using the QuEChERS method	A new, rapid, and efficient method for determining the fumagillin residues in honey was developed. The samples extracted were analyzed using LC/MS/MS. Chromatographic separation of fumagillin was performed in gradient mode on a C8 column (100 × 2.0 mm, 5 μm) at 40°C. The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of 2 mM ammonium formate-0.01% formic acid solution and methanol; the flow rate was set to 0.2 mL/min. Under these conditions, it was possible to measure fumagillin and its isomers as a single peak. The sample preparation procedure used is based on the (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) method, which is fast (approximately 30 min) and uses less organic solvent. The fumagillin was extracted with acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid, then purified using a solid-phase extraction method with an Oasis® mixed-mode weak anion-exchange cartridge. The overall recovery of fumagillin ranged from 88.1 to 99.4%; the intra- and interassay CVs were <4.5% and <4.9%, respectively. The LOQ was 0.1 μg/kg. LC/MS/MS coupled with the QuEChERS method showed strong potential as a method for determining fumagillin residues in honey.

Predicting pesticide fate in the hive (part 1): Experimentally determined τ-Fluvalinate residues in bees, honey and wax	τ-Fluvalinate residues in bees, honey and wax were measured in two experimental hives treated with Apistan to test a multi-compartmental predictive model. Pesticide residues were monitored for 30 days after treatment in bees and for up to 180 days in honey and wax. Concentrations ranged between 14 and 160 ng g -1 f.w. in bees and between 98 and 1630 ng g -1 in wax, while no residues were detected above the analytical limit (2.5 ng g -1) in honey. τ-Fluvalinate residues are discussed in the context of a survey of data from the literature on other pesticides (bromopropylate, coumaphos, malathion and amitraz). This data review shows that residues of the same compound exhibit extremely high variability within the same matrix. This finding underlines the importance of developing predictive tools for both post-treatment analysis and a priori evaluation of the possible contamination effects of pesticides depending on the mode of application. © INRA, DIB-AGIB and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., 2011.		bee, dose-response relationship, experimental study, honey, literature review, pesticide application, pesticide residue, wax, Apoidea	2011-05-01
Pollination Biology: Biodiversity conservation and agricultural production	This book has a wider approach not strictly focused on crop production compared to other books that are strictly oriented towards bees, but has a generalist approach to pollination biology. It also highlights relationships between introduced and wild pollinators and consequences of such introductions on communities of wild pollinating insects. The chapters on biochemical basis of plant-pollination interaction, pollination energetics, climate change and pollinators and pollinators as bioindicators of ecosystem functioning provide a base for future insights into pollination biology. The role of honeybees and wild bees on crop pollination, value of bee pollination, planned honeybee pollination, non-bee pollinators, safety of pollinators, pollination in cages, pollination for hybrid seed production, the problem of diseases, genetically modified plants and bees, the role of bees in improving food security and livelihoods, capacity building and awareness for pollinators are also discussed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.			2011-05-01
Sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia): A beneficial forage legume	The Onobrychis genus comprises a few agronomically important forage legume species, with sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) being the most widespread. O. viciifolia has a long history of traditional culture worldwide, but its use has declined in western countries over the last decades. It suffers from low productivity and is more difficult to maintain than other legumes but is known to have valuable characteristics such as palatability and drought tolerance. Recent studies suggest that it has several other highly beneficial properties due to its unique tannin and polyphenol composition. Condensed tannins present in Onobrychis species have been shown to confer anthelmintic properties, increase protein utilization and prevent bloating; they may also have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Positive effects on wildlife and honey production could also be advantageous in the context of sustainable farming. Modern breeding programmes have not been a priority, leading to a lack of genetic knowledge in comparison to extensively used forage legumes. It is expected that potential for O. viciifolia improvements could be achieved by rigorous characterization of the available germplasm and utilization of characters derived from close relatives of the genus.

Sub-lethal effects of pesticide residues in brood comb on worker honey bee (apis mellifera) development and longevity	Background:Numerous surveys reveal high levels of pesticide residue contamination in honey bee comb. We conducted studies to examine possible direct and indirect effects of pesticide exposure from contaminated brood comb on developing worker bees and adult worker lifespan.Methodology/Principal Findings:Worker bees were reared in brood comb containing high levels of known pesticide residues (treatment) or in relatively uncontaminated brood comb (control). Delayed development was observed in bees reared in treatment combs containing high levels of pesticides particularly in the early stages (day 4 and 8) of worker bee development. Adult longevity was reduced by 4 days in bees exposed to pesticide residues in contaminated brood comb during development. Pesticide residue migration from comb containing high pesticide residues caused contamination of control comb after multiple brood cycles and provided insight on how quickly residues move through wax. Higher brood mortality and delayed adult emergence occurred after multiple brood cycles in contaminated control combs. In contrast, survivability increased in bees reared in treatment comb after multiple brood cycles when pesticide residues had been reduced in treatment combs due to residue migration into uncontaminated control combs, supporting comb replacement efforts. Chemical analysis after the experiment confirmed the migration of pesticide residues from treatment combs into previously uncontaminated control comb.Conclusions/Significance:This study is the first to demonstrate sub-lethal effects on worker honey bees from pesticide residue exposure from contaminated brood comb. Sub-lethal effects, including delayed larval development and adult emergence or shortened adult longevity, can have indirect effects on the colony such as premature shifts in hive roles and foraging activity. In addition, longer development time for bees may provide a reproductive advantage for parasitic Varroa destructor mites. The impact of delayed development in bees on Varroa mite fecundity should be examined further. © 2011 Wu et al.		fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, pesticide residue, pesticide residue, arthropod life cycle stage, article, concentration (parameters), controlled study, environmental exposure, fertility, foraging behavior, honeybee, imago, indicator organism, insect development, larval development, lethality, longevity, nonhuman, organism colony, parasite viability, pesticide spraying, survival rate, Varroa, worker (insect), age, animal, animal housing, bee, drug effect, ecosystem, evaluation, female, grooming, growth, development and aging, larva, longevity, male, physiology, reproduction, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Varroa, Varroa destructor, Age Factors, Animals, Bees, Ecosystem, Environmental Exposure, Female, Grooming, Growth and Development, Housing, Animal, Larva, Longevity, Male, Pesticide Residues, Reproduction	2011-03-02
Viruses associated with ovarian degeneration in Apis mellifera L. Queens	Queen fecundity is a critical issue for the health of honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies, as she is the only reproductive female in the colony and responsible for the constant renewal of the worker bee population. Any factor affecting the queen's fecundity will stagnate colony development, increasing its susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens. We discovered a pathology affecting the ovaries, characterized by a yellow discoloration concentrated in the apex of the ovaries resulting from degenerative lesions in the follicles. In extreme cases, marked by intense discoloration, the majority of the ovarioles were affected and these cases were universally associated with egg-laying deficiencies in the queens. Microscopic examination of the degenerated follicles showed extensive paracrystal lattices of 30 nm icosahedral viral particles. A cDNA library from degenerated ovaries contained a high frequency of deformed wing virus (DWV) and Varroa destructor virus 1 (VDV-1) sequences, two common and closely related honeybee Iflaviruses. These could also be identified by in situ hybridization in various parts of the ovary. A large-scale survey for 10 distinct honeybee viruses showed that DWV and VDV-1 were by far the most prevalent honeybee viruses in queen populations, with distinctly higher prevalence in mated queens (100% and 67%, respectively for DWV and VDV-1) than in virgin queens (37% and 0%, respectively). Since very high viral titres could be recorded in the ovaries and abdomens of both functional and deficient queens, no significant correlation could be made between viral titre and ovarian degeneration or egg-laying deficiency among the wider population of queens. Although our data suggest that DWV and VDV-1 have a role in extreme cases of ovarian degeneration, infection of the ovaries by these viruses does not necessarily result in ovarian degeneration, even at high titres, and additional factors are likely to be involved in this pathology. © 2011 Gauthier et al.		animal tissue, article, controlled study, deformed wing virus, egg laying, female, fertility, Flavivirus, honeybee, nonhuman, ovary disease, ovary follicle, queen (insect), Varroa destructor virus 1, virus particle, virus titration, animal, bee, gene library, insect virus, isolation and purification, ovary, pathology, virology, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Deformed wing virus, Varroa destructor virus 1, Animals, Bees, Female, Fertility, Gene Library, Insect Viruses, Ovarian Follicle, Ovary	2011-02-07
Cell death localization in situ in laboratory reared honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) larvae treated with pesticides	In this study, cell death detected by DNA fragmentation labeling and phosphatidylserine (PS) localization was investigated in the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) midgut, salivary glands and ovaries after treating larvae with different pesticides offered via an artificial diet. To do this, honey bee larvae reared in an incubator were exposed to one of nine pesticides: chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid, amitraz, fluvalinate, coumaphos, myclobutanil, chlorothalonil, glyphosate and simazine. Following this, larvae were fixed and prepared for immunohistologically detected cellular death using two TUNEL techniques for DNA fragmentation labeling and Annexin V to detect the localization of exposed PS specific in situ binding to apoptotic cells. Untreated larvae experienced ∼10% midgut apoptotic cell death under controlled conditions. All applied pesticides triggered an increase in apoptosis in treated compared to untreated larvae. The level of cell death in the midgut of simazine-treated larvae was highest at 77% mortality and statistically similar to the level of cell death for chlorpyrifos (65%), imidacloprid (61%), myclobutanil (69%), and glyphosate (69%) treated larvae. Larvae exposed to fluvalinate had the lowest midgut columnar apoptotic cell death (30%) of any pesticide-treated larvae. Indications of elevated apoptotic cell death in salivary glands and ovaries after pesticide application were detected. Annexin V localization, indicative of apoptotic cell deletion, had an extensive distribution in the midgut, salivary glands and ovaries of pesticide-treated larvae. The data suggest that the tested pesticides induced apoptosis in tissues of honey bee larvae at the tested concentrations. Cell death localization as a tool for a monitoring the subclinical and sub-lethal effects of external influences on honey bee larval tissues is discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Octopamine-A single modulator with double action on the heart of two insect species (Apis mellifera macedonica and Bactrocera oleae): Acceleration vs. inhibition	The effects of octopamine, the main cardioacceleratory transmitter in insects, were investigated, in the isolated hearts of the honeybee, Apis mellifera macedonica, and the olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae. Octopamine induced a biphasic effect on the frequency and force of cardiac contractions acting as an agonist, with a strong acceleratory effect, at concentrations higher than 10 -12M for the honeybee and higher than 50×10 -9M for the olive fruit fly. The heart of the honeybee is far more sensitive than the heart of olive fruit fly. This unusual sensitivity is extended to the blockers of octopaminergic receptors, where phentolamine at 10 -5M stopped the spontaneous contractions of the honeybee heart completely and permanently, while the same blocker at the same concentration caused only 50% inhibition in the heart of the olive fruit fly. Phentolamine and mianserin at low concentrations of 10 -7M also blocked the heart octopaminergic receptors, but for a short period of time, of less than 15.0min, while a partial recovery in heart contraction started in spite of the presence of the antagonist. The unusual response of the honeybee heart in the presence of phentolamine and/or mianserin suggests excitatory effects of octopamine via two different receptor subtypes. At lower concentrations, 10 -14M, the agonist octopamine was converted to an antagonist, inducing a hyperpolarization in the membrane potential of the honeybee cardiac pacemaker cells and inhibiting the firing rate of the heart. The inhibitory effects of octopamine on certain parameters of the rhythmic bursts of the heart of the honeybee, were similar to those of mianserin and phentolamine, typical blockers of octopaminergic receptors. The heart of the olive fruit fly was 10 5 times less sensitive to octopamine, since a persistent inhibition of heart contractions occurred at 10 -9M. In conclusion, the acceleration of the insect heart is achieved by increasing the levels of octopamine, while there is a passive but also an active decrease in heart activity due to the minimization of octopamine. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.		mianserin, norsynephrine receptor, octopamine, phentolamine, receptor, ammonium compound, antagonism, cardiovascular system, concentration (composition), inhibition, inhibitor, insect, animal, article, bee, drug antagonism, drug effect, heart, heart rate, physiology, Tephritidae, Animals, Bees, Heart, Heart Rate, Mianserin, Octopamine, Phentolamine, Receptors, Biogenic Amine, Tephritidae, Apis mellifera, Apis mellifera macedonica, Bactrocera oleae, Hexapoda	2011-02-01
The role of resources and risks in regulating wild bee populations	Recent declines of bee species have led to great interest in preserving and promoting bee populations for agricultural and wild plant pollination. Many correlational studies have examined the indirect effects of factors such as landscape context and land management practices and found great variation in bee response. We focus here on the evidence for effects of direct factors (i.e., food resources, nesting resources, and incidental risks) regulating bee populations and then interpret varied responses to indirect factors through their species-specific and habitat-specific effects on direct factors. We find strong evidence for food resource availability regulating bee populations, but little clear evidence that other direct factors are commonly limiting. We recommend manipulative experiments to illuminate the effects of these different factors. We contend that much of the variation in impact from indirect factors, such as grazing, can be explained by the relationships between indirect factors and floral resource availability based on environmental circumstances. © 2011 by Annual Reviews.

Toxicity of mycotoxins to honeybees and its amelioration by propolis	Honeybees (Apis mellifera) and their resource-rich nests are hosts to a wide range of saprophytic fungi, including species that produce mycotoxins. The toxicity of aflatoxin B1 (AB1) and ochratoxin A (OTA), products of Aspergillus species often found in honeybee hives, was evaluated and LC 50 values for both toxins were calculated. Workers can tolerate a wide range of concentrations of both OTA and AB1. At low concentrations, AB1 (1 μg/g and 2.5 μg/g diet) and OTA (1 μg/g) did not have any apparent toxic effects on bees. Enhancement of the toxicity of AB1 by piperonyl butoxide (PBO), a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, indicates a role for P450s in AB1 detoxification in honeybees. Extracts of propolis, a complex mixture of plant-derived chemicals, including many flavonoids and other phenolic compounds, similarly ameliorated aflatoxin toxicity and delayed the onset of mortality. Collectively, these results suggest that tolerance of AB1 by honeybees may be due to P450-mediated metabolic detoxification. Propolis may serve a hitherto unrecognized role in honey bee health by enhancing the activity of P450 enzymes involved in mycotoxin detoxification. © INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences, 2010.		concentration (composition), detoxification, dose-response relationship, enzyme activity, fungus, honeybee, inhibitor, mortality, phenolic compound, phytochemistry, resin, toxicity test, toxin, worker caste, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Aspergillus, Fungi	2011-01-01
The plight of the bees	The loss of biodiversity is a trend that is garnering much concern. As organisms have evolved mutualistic and synergistic relationships, the loss of one or a few species can have a much wider environmental impact. Since much pollination is facilitated by bees, the reported colony collapse disorder has many worried of widespread agricultural fallout and thus deleterious impact on human foodstocks. In this Feature, Spivak et al. review what is known of the present state of bee populations and provide information on how to mitigate and reverse the trend. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

An assessment of honeybee colony matrices, Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) to monitor pesticide presence in continental France	The frequency of occurrence and relative concentration of 44 pesticides in apicultural (Apis mellifera) matrices collected from five French locations (24 apiaries) were assessed from 2002 to 2005. The number and nature of the pesticides investigated varied with the matrices examined-living honeybees, pollen loads, honey, and beeswax. Pollen loads and beeswax had the highest frequency of pesticide occurrence among the apiary matrices examined in the present study, whereas honey samples had the lowest. The imidacloprid group and the fipronil group were detected in sufficient amounts in all matrices to allow statistical comparisons. Some seasonal variation was shown when residues were identified in pollen loads. Given the results (highest frequency of presence) and practical aspects (easy to collect; matrix with no turnover, unlike with bees that are naturally renewed), pollen loads were the best matrix for assessing the presence of pesticide residues in the environment in our given conditions. © 2010 SETAC.

A meta-analysis of experiments testing the effects of a neonicotinoid insecticide (imidacloprid) on honey bees	Honey bees provide important pollination services to crops and wild plants. The agricultural use of systemic insecticides, such as neonicotinoids, may harm bees through their presence in pollen and nectar, which bees consume. Many studies have tested the effects on honey bees of imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid, but a clear picture of the risk it poses to bees has not previously emerged, because investigations are methodologically varied and inconsistent in outcome. In a meta-analysis of fourteen published studies of the effects of imidacloprid on honey bees under laboratory and semi-field conditions that comprised measurements on 7073 adult individuals and 36 colonies, fitted dose-response relationships estimate that trace dietary imidacloprid at field-realistic levels in nectar will have no lethal effects, but will reduce expected performance in honey bees by between 6 and 20%. Statistical power analysis showed that published field trials that have reported no effects on honey bees from neonicotinoids were incapable of detecting these predicted sublethal effects with conventionally accepted levels of certainty. These findings raise renewed concern about the impact on honey bees of dietary imidacloprid, but because questions remain over the environmental relevance of predominantly laboratory-based results, I identify targets for research and provide procedural recommendations for future studies. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.		imidacloprid, agrochemical, dose-response relationship, ecosystem service, honeybee, imidacloprid, insecticide, meta-analysis, pollination, pollution effect, sublethal effect, acute toxicity, animal experiment, article, chronic toxicity, concentration (parameters), concentration response, controlled study, dietary intake, environmental exposure, honeybee, imago, insect development, insecticidal activity, LC 50, LD 50, lethality, nectar, nonhuman, organism colony, pollination, priority journal, toxicity testing, Animals, Bees, Environmental Exposure, Imidazoles, Insecticides, Nitro Compounds, Toxicity Tests, Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2011-01-01
High Levels of Miticides and Agrochemicals in North American Apiaries: Implications for Honey Bee Health	Background: Recent declines in honey bees for crop pollination threaten fruit, nut, vegetable and seed production in the United States. A broad survey of pesticide residues was conducted on samples from migratory and other beekeepers across 23 states, one Canadian province and several agricultural cropping systems during the 2007-08 growing seasons. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have used LC/MS-MS and GC/MS to analyze bees and hive matrices for pesticide residues utilizing a modified QuEChERS method. We have found 121 different pesticides and metabolites within 887 wax, pollen, bee and associated hive samples. Almost 60% of the 259 wax and 350 pollen samples contained at least one systemic pesticide, and over 47% had both in-hive acaricides fluvalinate and coumaphos, and chlorothalonil, a widely-used fungicide. In bee pollen were found chlorothalonil at levels up to 99 ppm and the insecticides aldicarb, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid, fungicides boscalid, captan and myclobutanil, and herbicide pendimethalin at 1 ppm levels. Almost all comb and foundation wax samples (98%) were contaminated with up to 204 and 94 ppm, respectively, of fluvalinate and coumaphos, and lower amounts of amitraz degradates and chlorothalonil, with an average of 6 pesticide detections per sample and a high of 39. There were fewer pesticides found in adults and brood except for those linked with bee kills by permethrin (20 ppm) and fipronil (3.1 ppm). Conclusions/Significance: The 98 pesticides and metabolites detected in mixtures up to 214 ppm in bee pollen alone represents a remarkably high level for toxicants in the brood and adult food of this primary pollinator. This represents over half of the maximum individual pesticide incidences ever reported for apiaries. While exposure to many of these neurotoxicants elicits acute and sublethal reductions in honey bee fitness, the effects of these materials in combinations and their direct association with CCD or declining bee health remains to be determined.		acaricide, agricultural chemical, chlorothalonil, herbicide, nitrile, pesticide, animal, apiculture, article, bee, drug effect, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, methodology, North America, pollen, time, Acaricides, Agrochemicals, Animals, Beekeeping, Bees, Chromatography, Liquid, Herbicides, Mass Spectrometry, Nitriles, North America, Pesticides, Pollen, Time Factors	2010-12-01
Parasitic mites and microsporidians in managed western honey bee colonies on the island of Newfoundland, Canada	Western honey bees, Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), occur in nearly every region inhabited by man because they provide valuable honey, wax, and pollination services. Many commercial honey bee operations are plagued by economically important parasites; however, beekeepers on the island of Newfoundland, Canada, are in a unique position because of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador's strict import regulations and geographic isolation. We surveyed about 25% of the island's approximately 100 managed honey bee colonies. The parasitic mites Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman (Acari: Varroidae) and Acarapis woodi (Rennie) (Acari: Tarsonemidae) were not detected, whereas Nosema spp. microsporidia were detected in two of four beekeeping operations and in 11 of 23 (48%) colonies (intensity = 482 609 + 1199489 (mean ± SD); median intensity = 0). Because V. destructor and A. woodi are important pests that typically require chemical treatments, beekeepers on the island of Newfoundland may be uniquely positioned to market organic honey bee products from colonies that could also be a source of mite-nave bees for research. © 2010 Entomological Society of Canada.		chemical control, commercial species, ecosystem service, field survey, fungus, honeybee, isolated population, mite, pest damage, Canada, Newfoundland, Newfoundland and Labrador, Acarapis woodi, Acari, Apidae, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hymenoptera, Microsporidia, Nosema, Tarsonemidae, Varroa, Varroa destructor, Varroidae	2010-12-01
Overview of pesticide residues in stored pollen and their potential effect on bee colony (Apis mellifera) losses in Spain	In the last decade, an increase in honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colony losses has been reported in several countries. The causes of this decline are still not clear. This study was set out to evaluate the pesticide residues in stored pollen from honey bee colonies and their possible impact on honey bee losses in Spain. In total, 1,021 professional apiaries were randomly selected. All pollen samples were subjected to multiresidue analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( MS ) and liquid chromatography-MS; moreover, specific methods were applied for neonicotinoids and fipronil. A palynological analysis also was carried out to confirm the type of foraging crop. Pesticide residues were detected in 42% of samples collected in spring, and only in 31% of samples collected in autumn. Fluvalinate and chlorfenvinphos were the most frequently detected pesticides in the analyzed samples. Fipronil was detected in 3.7% of all the spring samples but never in autumn samples, and neonicotinoid residues were not detected. More than 47.8% of stored pollen samples belonged to wild vegetation, and sunflower (Heliantus spp.) pollen was only detected in 10.4% of the samples. A direct relation between pesticide residues found in stored pollen samples and colony losses was not evident accordingly to the obtained results. Further studies are necessary to determine the possible role of the most frequent and abundant pesticides (such as acaricides) and the synergism among them and with other pathogens more prevalent in Spain. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.		insecticide, pesticide residue, animal, apiculture, article, bee, chemistry, pollen, Spain, Animals, Beekeeping, Bees, Insecticides, Pesticide Residues, Pollen, Spain, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Helianthus	2010-12-01
Iridovirus and microsporidian linked to honey bee colony decline	Background: In 2010 Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), again devastated honey bee colonies in the USA, indicating that the problem is neither diminishing nor has it been resolved. Many CCD investigations, using sensitive genome-based methods, have found small RNA bee viruses and the microsporidia, Nosema apis and N. ceranae in healthy and collapsing colonies alike with no single pathogen firmly linked to honey bee losses. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used Mass spectrometry-based proteomics (MSP) to identify and quantify thousands of proteins from healthy and collapsing bee colonies. MSP revealed two unreported RNA viruses in North American honey bees, Varroa destructor-1 virus and Kakugo virus, and identified an invertebrate iridescent virus (IIV) (Iridoviridae) associated with CCD colonies. Prevalence of IIV significantly discriminated among strong, failing, and collapsed colonies. In addition, bees in failing colonies contained not only IIV, but also Nosema. Co-occurrence of these microbes consistently marked CCD in (1) bees from commercial apiaries sampled across the U.S. in 2006-2007, (2) bees sequentially sampled as the disorder progressed in an observation hive colony in 2008, and (3) bees from a recurrence of CCD in Florida in 2009. The pathogen pairing was not observed in samples from colonies with no history of CCD, namely bees from Australia and a large, nonmigratory beekeeping business in Montana. Laboratory cage trials with a strain of IIV type 6 and Nosema ceranae confirmed that co-infection with these two pathogens was more lethal to bees than either pathogen alone. Conclusions/Significance: These findings implicate co-infection by IIV and Nosema with honey bee colony decline, giving credence to older research pointing to IIV, interacting with Nosema and mites, as probable cause of bee losses in the USA, Europe, and Asia. We next need to characterize the IIV and Nosema that we detected and develop management practices to reduce honey bee losses.		article, Australia, colony collapse, controlled study, honeybee, Iridovirus, Kakugo virus, mass spectrometry, Microsporidia, mixed infection, nonhuman, Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae, prevalence, protein analysis, proteomics, RNA virus, United States, Varroa destructor 1 virus, animal, bee, pathogenicity, virology, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Invertebrata, Iridoviridae, Iridovirus, Kakugo virus, Microsporidia, Nosema, Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae, RNA viruses, Varroa destructor, Animals, Bees, Colony Collapse, Iridovirus, Mass Spectrometry, Microsporidia, United States	2010-11-04
Is Apis mellifera more sensitive to insecticides than other insects?	BACKGROUND: Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) are among the most important pollinators in natural and agricultural settings. They commonly encounter insecticides, and the effects of insecticides on honey bees have been frequently noted. It has been suggested that honey bees may be (as a species) uniquely sensitive to insecticides, although no comparative toxicology study has been undertaken to examine this claim. An extensive literature review was conducted, using data in which adult insects were topically treated with insecticides. The goal of this review was to summarize insecticide toxicity data between A. mellifera and other insects to determine the relative sensitivity of honey bees to insecticides. RESULTS: It was found that, in general, honey bees were no more sensitive than other insect species across the 62 insecticides examined. In addition, honey bees were not more sensitive to any of the six classes of insecticides (carbamates, nicotinoids, organochlorines, organophosphates, pyrethroids and miscellaneous) examined. CONCLUSIONS: While honey bees can be sensitive to individual insecticides, they are not a highly sensitive species to insecticides overall, or even to specific classes of insecticides. However, all pesticides should be used in a way that minimizes honey bee exposure, so as to minimize possible declines in the number of bees and/or honey contamination. © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry.		insecticide, carbamate, comparative study, honeybee, organophosphate, pollinator, pyrethroid, toxicology, animal, bee, chemistry, drug effect, environmental exposure, LD 50, review, species difference, Animals, Bees, Environmental Exposure, Insecticides, Lethal Dose 50, Species Specificity, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hexapoda	2010-11-01
Weighing risk factors associated with bee colony collapse disorder by classification and regression tree analysis	Colony collapse disorder (CCD), a syndrome whose defining trait is the rapid loss of adult worker honey bees, Apis mellifera L., is thought to be responsible for a minority of the large overwintering losses experienced by U.S. beekeepers since the winter 2006-2007. Using the same data set developed to perform a monofactorial analysis (PloS ONE 4: e6481, 2009), we conducted a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis in an attempt to better understand the relative importance and interrelations among different risk variables in explaining CCD. Fifty-five exploratory variables were used to construct two CART models: one model with and one model without a cost of misclassifying a CCD-diagnosed colony as a non-CCD colony. The resulting model tree that permitted for misclassification had a sensitivity and specificity of 85 and 74%, respectively. Although factors measuring colony stress (e.g., adult bee physiological measures, such as fluctuating asymmetry or mass of head) were important discriminating values, six of the 19 variables having the greatest discriminatory value were pesticide levels in different hive matrices. Notably, coumaphos levels in brood (a miticide commonly used by beekeepers) had the highest discriminatory value and were highest in control (healthy) colonies. Our CART analysis provides evidence that CCD is probably the result of several factors acting in concert, making afflicted colonies more susceptible to disease. This analysis highlights several areas that warrant further attention, including the effect of sublethal pesticide exposure on pathogen prevalence and the role of variability in bee tolerance to pesticides on colony survivorship. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.		coumafos, insecticide, pesticide, animal, article, bee, classification, colony collapse, drug effect, drug tolerance, genetic predisposition, genetics, physiology, regression analysis, risk factor, syndrome, Animals, Bees, Colony Collapse, Coumaphos, Drug Tolerance, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Insecticides, Pesticides, Regression Analysis, Risk Factors, Syndrome, Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2010-10-01
Practical sampling plans for varroa destructor (Acari: Varroidae) in apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) colonies and apiaries	The parasitic mite Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman (Acari: Varroidae) is arguably the most detrimental pest of the European-derived honey bee, Apis mellifera L. Unfortunately, beekeepers lack a standardized sampling plan to make informed treatment decisions. Based on data from 31 commercial apiaries, we developed sampling plans for use by beekeepers and researchers to estimate the density of mites in individual colonies or whole apiaries. Beekeepers can estimate a colony's mite density with chosen level of precision by dislodging mites from ≈300 adult bees taken from one brood box frame in the colony, and they can extrapolate to mite density on a colony's adults and pupae combined by doubling the number of mites on adults. For sampling whole apiaries, beekeepers can repeat the process in each of n = 8 colonies, regardless of apiary size. Researchers desiring greater precision can estimate mite density in an individual colony by examining three, 300-bee sample units. Extrapolation to density on adults and pupae may require independent estimates of numbers of adults, of pupae, and of their respective mite densities. Researchers can estimate apiary-level mite density by taking one 300-bee sample unit per colony, but should do so from a variable number of colonies, depending on apiary size. These practical sampling plans will allow beekeepers and researchers to quantify mite infestation levels and enhance understanding and management of V. destructor. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.		animal, article, bee, host parasite interaction, insect control, parasitology, physiology, population dynamics, time, Varroidae, bee, parasitology, physiology, Varroidae, Animals, Bees, Host-Parasite Interactions, Population Dynamics, Tick Control, Time Factors, Varroidae, Acari, Apidae, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hymenoptera, Varroa, Varroa destructor, Varroidae, Animals, Bees, Host-Parasite Interactions, Population Dynamics, Tick Control, Time Factors, Varroidae	2010-08-01
Transcriptional responses in Honey Bee larvae infected with chalkbrood fungus	Background: Diseases and other stress factors working synergistically weaken honey bee health and may play a major role in the losses of bee populations in recent years. Among a large number of bee diseases, chalkbrood has been on the rise. We present here the experimental identification of honey bee genes that are differentially expressed in response to infection of honey bee larvae with the chalkbrood fungus, Ascosphaera apis.Results: We used cDNA-AFLP ®Technology to profile transcripts in infected and uninfected bee larvae. From 64 primer combinations, over 7,400 transcriptionally-derived fragments were obtained A total of 98 reproducible polymorphic cDNA-AFLP fragments were excised and sequenced, followed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of these and additional samples.We have identified a number of differentially-regulated transcripts that are implicated in general mechanisms of stress adaptation, including energy metabolism and protein transport. One of the most interesting differentially-regulated transcripts is for a chitinase-like enzyme that may be linked to anti-fungal activities in the honey bee larvae, similarly to gut and fat-body specific chitinases found in mosquitoes and the red flour beetle. Surprisingly, we did not find many components of the well-characterized NF-κB intracellular signaling pathways to be differentially-regulated using the cDNA-AFLP approach. Therefore, utilizing qRT-PCR, we probed some of the immune related genes to determine whether the lack of up-regulation of their transcripts in our analysis can be attributed to lack of immune activation or to limitations of the cDNA-AFLP approach.Conclusions: Using a combination of cDNA-AFLP and qRT-PCR analyses, we were able to determine several key transcriptional events that constitute the overall effort in the honey bee larvae to fight natural fungal infection. Honey bee transcripts identified in this study are involved in critical functions related to transcriptional regulation, apoptotic degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, nutritional regulation, and RNA processing. We found that immune regulation of the anti-fungal responses in honey bee involves highly coordinated activation of both NF-κB signaling pathways, leading to production of anti-microbial peptides. Significantly, activation of immune responses in the infected bee larvae was associated with down-regulation of major storage proteins, leading to depletion of nutritional resources. © 2010 Aronstein et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.		chitinase, complementary DNA, immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein, polypeptide antibiotic agent, RNA, drug, immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein, insect protein, messenger RNA, amplified fragment length polymorphism, animal tissue, antifungal activity, apoptosis, arthropod larva, article, Ascosphaera apis, beetle, controlled study, DNA polymorphism, DNA sequence, down regulation, energy metabolism, enzyme activity, enzyme specificity, fungus, gene expression profiling, gene expression regulation, gene function, gene identification, honeybee, immune response, mosquito, mycosis, nonhuman, nucleotide sequence, nutrition, protein synthesis, protein transport, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RNA processing, sequence analysis, signal transduction, stress, transcription regulation, animal, bee, cytology, disease course, genetic transcription, genetics, human, humoral immunity, immunology, larva, lipid metabolism, metabolism, microbiology, mouse, Onygenales, pathology, phosphorylation, physiological stress, physiology, transport at the cellular level, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Ascosphaera, Fungi, Tribolium castaneum, Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis, Animals, Apoptosis, Bees, Biological Transport, Disease Progression, DNA, Complementary, Gene Expression Profiling, Humans, Immunity, Humoral, Insect Proteins, Larva, Lipid Metabolism, Mice, Mycoses, NF-kappa B, Onygenales, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Phosphorylation, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, RNA, Messenger, Signal Transduction, Stress, Physiological, Transcription, Genetic	2010-06-21
The puzzle of honey bee losses: A brief review	The impact of pesticides on honey bees is an issue that has been studied for many years and is now being reconsidered because controversy still exists with the relationship of insecticides and Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). It is insufficient to explain CCD with only bee pathology studies. Research must be conducted on a wider series of causes: i) in open field and agroecosystems, to understand the fate of pesticide blends, ii) in the hives, to determine ways to enhance honey bee defence to diseases and parasites. References regarding imidacloprid and CCD in the maize agroecosystems are critically reviewed. Pesticides and the thechniques to rationally use them (in particular following the integrated pest management guidelines) represent one of the several puzzles regarding the mystery of CCD or honey bee vanishing. An appendix, i.e., a rejected letter to Science and relevant reply, is also reported.		Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Zea mays	2010-06-01
Preserved honey bee health in Latin America: A fragile equilibrium due to low-intensity agriculture and beekeeping?	The Latin American subcontinent contains some of the world's major honey producing and exporting countries, but the status of bee health in this part of the world has not been clearly documented. There have been no reports of massive colony losses in Latin America, at least from the symptoms of CCD (colony collapse disorder) or in the proportion and extent of the situations in the US and Europe. We examine possible reasons for the difference, and develop hypotheses that this prevailing good bee health could be due to: (1) the management of generally unselected bees with a certain natural resistance to diseases (tropical regions) or the selection of disease resistant bees (temperate regions); (2) a lower proportion of cropland over the total land area, resulting in more abundant or higher-quality pollen resources for bees; (3) the generally small-scale, low-income and little subsidized agriculture, and concomitant lower use of insecticides compared to industrialized countries. These general parameters may act synergistically, resulting in a large number of configurations across the tremendous ecological, social and economic diversity of Latin America. We suggest that the health of honey bees in Latin America may be ultimately due to the practices of low-income agriculture and beekeeping in the region, leading to more sustainable conditions for the bees. However the increasing trend of land use intensification in some parts of Latin America could lead to declines in honey bee health and population size. © 2010 INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences.		agricultural land, agricultural practice, anthropogenic effect, apiculture, disease resistance, genetic variation, honey, honeybee, hypothesis testing, land use change, nutrition, pollen, population decline, symptom, Latin America, Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2010-05-01
Varroa mites and honey bee health: Can Varroa explain part of the colony losses?	Since 2006, disastrous colony losses have been reported in Europe and North America. The causes of the losses were not readily apparent and have been attributed to overwintering mortalities and to a new phenomenon called Colony Collapse Disorder. Most scientists agree that there is no single explanation for the extensive colony losses but that interactions between different stresses are involved. As the presence of Varroa in each colony places an important pressure on bee health, we here address the question of how Varroa contributes to the recent surge in honey bee colony losses. © 2010 INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences.		honeybee, host-parasite interaction, mite, mortality, overwintering, pathogen, population decline, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2010-05-01
Managed pollinator CAP coordinated agricultural project: Pesticides applied to crops and honey bee toxicity	This article discusses the role that pesticides applied to crops may play in honey bee health. Although no one pesticide has been clearly associated with causing colony collapse disorder, there is evidence that the additive and synergistic effects of multiple pesticide exposures are harming bees. Pesticide use patterns have changed in the past decade, and this article reviews research on how crop pest control practices are affecting honey bee health. It then concludes with a discussion of the current risk assessment protocols to protect honey bees and how they are being amended to address current issues and concerns.

Pesticides and honey bee toxicity - USA	Until 1985 discussions of pesticides and honey bee toxicity in the USA were focused on pesticides applied to crops and the unintentional exposure of foraging bees to them. The recent introduction of arthropod pests of honey bees, Acarapis woodi (1984), Varroa destructor (1987), and Aethina tumida (1997), to the USA have resulted in the intentional introduction of pesticides into beehives to suppress these pests. Both the unintentional and the intentional exposure of honey bees to pesticides have resulted in residues in hive products, especially beeswax. This review examines pesticides applied to crops, pesticides used in apiculture and pesticide residues in hive products. We discuss the role that pesticides and their residues in hive products may play in colony collapse disorder and other colony problems. Although no single pesticide has been shown to cause colony collapse disorder, the additive and synergistic effects of multiple pesticide exposures may contribute to declining honey bee health. © 2010 INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences.		apiculture, honeybee, introduced species, pest control, pesticide, pollution exposure, synergism, wax, United States, Acarapis woodi, Aethina tumida, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Arthropoda, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2010-05-01
Landscape enhancement of floral resources for honey bees in agro-ecosystems	Honey bee populations have experienced serious losses in Europe and North America. These losses highlight the potential risk to our agricultural systems that could result from loss of pollination. These losses include direct economic repercussions to multiple industries (beekeeping, fruit, vegetable, forage seed, oil seed and biofuel crops), and corresponding threats to human nutrition. Reasons for the losses are varied but include a lack of diverse nectar and pollen resources within intensively farmed agricultural landscapes. Focusing primarily on Europe and the USA, we review the potential approaches to provide and maintain diverse floral resources for honey bees, giving particular consideration to herbaceous plants ("forbs"). These approaches include the cultivation and maintenance of "bee pastures", consisting of diverse native or non-native flower-rich plantings maintained in fallow areas, field margins, and conservation buffer strips to sustain bee populations, support honey bee health, and aid beekeeping activities. Within this review we examine specific governmental policy initiatives to support these efforts in the USA and Europe. © 2010 INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences.		agri-environmental policy, agricultural ecosystem, apiculture, buffer zone, environmental economics, environmental management, fallow, honeybee, nectar, pasture, pollination, state role, Europe, United States, Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2010-05-01
Impact of Bacillus thuringiensis strains on survival, reproduction and foraging behaviour in bumblebees (Bombus terrestris)	Background: Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and its protein crystals are used worldwide, either as a spray or when expressed in transgenic crops, for the control of pest insects. However, owing to their intensive use, there exists a debate regarding the involvement of this microbial insecticide in beecolony losses. In this study, inatiered approach using laboratory microcolonies, an evaluation was made of the potential lethaland sublethal hazardson colony reproduction and for aging behaviour of workers of the bumblebee Bombusterrestris (L.) of two commercial Bt strains: kurstaki (Dipel®) and aizawai (Xentari®). Bumblebees, like honey bees, are intensively used in modern agriculture for pollination and fulfil a crucial role in the natural ecosystem. Results: Exposure of bumble bees dermally or viatreated pollen to either of the two Btformulations at their fielder commended rates (0.1%) caused no reduction in survival. However, when applied in the feeding sugar water, aizawai killed all workers at a concentration of 0.1%, but this lethal effect was lost at 0.01%. With respect to reproductive effects, kurstaki was harmless, while aizawai at 0.1% delivered in the feeding sugar water and pollen reduced reproduction by 100 and 31% respectively. Lower doses of 0.01% aizawai in the sugar water showed no more effect. In addition, kurstaki at 0.1% and aizawai at 0.01% in the feeding sugar water did not impair the foraging behaviour, resulting in normal nest colony performance. Conclusion: The results with kurstaki and aizawai demonstrated that, in general, the Bt strains are safe to B. terrestris bumblebees, although in some cases there were detrimental effects that dependedon strain and route of exposure. In addition, the authors believe that to draw firm conclusions regarding the hazards of Bt to bumblebees would require more information on relevant concentrations of Bt products in the environment. Hence, routine testing for lethal and sublethal effects is recommended to ascertain combined use of Bt products and bumblebees in modern agriculture. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.		bacterial toxin, bee, foraging behavior, pest control, pollination, protein, reproduction, sublethal effect, survival, transgenic plant, agriculture, animal, article, Bacillus thuringiensis, bee, biological pest control, drug effect, environmental exposure, feeding behavior, male, methodology, microbiology, physiology, reproduction, safety, survival, Agriculture, Animals, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacterial Toxins, Bees, Environmental Exposure, Feeding Behavior, Male, Pest Control, Biological, Reproduction, Safety, Survival Analysis, Apis mellifera, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bombus (genus), Bombus terrestris, Hexapoda	2010-05-01
Research strategies to improve honeybee health in Europe	Understanding the fundaments of colony losses and improving the status of colony health will require cross-cutting research initiatives including honeybee pathology, chemistry, genetics and apicultural extension. The 7th framework of the European Union requested research to empirically and experimentally fill knowledge gaps on honeybee pests and diseases, including 'Colony Collapse Disorder' and the impact of parasites, pathogens and pesticides on honeybee mortality. The interactions among these drivers of colony loss will be studied in different European regions, using experimental model systems including selected parasites (e.g. Nosema and Varroa mites), viruses (Deformed Wing Virus, Black Queen Cell Virus, Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus) and model pesticides (thiacloprid, τ-fluvalinate). Transcriptome analyses will be used to explore host-pathogen-pesticide interactions and identify novel genes for disease resistance. Special attention will be given to sublethal and chronic exposure to pesticides and will screen how apicultural practices affect colony health. Novel diagnostic screening methods and sustainable concepts for disease prevention will be developed resulting in new treatments and selection tools for resistant stock. Research initiatives will be linked to various national and international ongoing European, North- and South-American colony health monitoring and research programs, to ensure a global transfer of results to apicultural practice in the world community of beekeepers. © 2010 INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences.		agricultural research, apiculture, disease control, disease resistance, honeybee, mite, mortality, parasite, pathology, pesticide, pollution exposure, research work, social insect, sublethal effect, viral disease, Europe, Acari, Acute bee paralysis virus, Apis mellifera, Black queen cell virus, Deformed wing virus, Nosema, Varroa	2010-05-01
Novel lactic acid bacteria inhibiting Paenibacillus larvae in honey bee larvae	We evaluated the antagonistic effects of newly identified lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, originating from the honey stomach, on the honey bee pathogen, Paenibacillus larvae. We used inhibition assays on agar plates and honey bee larval bioassays to investigate the effects of honey bee LAB on P. larvae growth in vitro and on AFB infection in vivo. The individual LAB phylotypes showed different inhibition properties against P. larvae growth on agar plates, whereas a combination of all eleven LAB phylotypes resulted in a total inhibition (no visible growth) of P. larvae. Adding the LAB mixture to the larval food significantly reduced the number of AFB infected larvae in exposure bioassays. The results demonstrate that honey bee specific LAB possess beneficial properties for honey bee health. Possible benefits to honey bee health by enhancing growth of LAB or by applying LAB to honey bee colonies should be further investigated. © INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences, 2009.		agar, bacterium, bioassay, carboxylic acid, growth rate, honeybee, host-pathogen interaction, inhibition, larva, Apis mellifera, Bacteria (microorganisms), Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Paenibacillus, Paenibacillus larvae	2010-01-01
Socialized medicine: Individual and communal disease barriers in honey bees	Honey bees are attacked by numerous parasites and pathogens toward which they present a variety of individual and group-level defenses. In this review, we briefly introduce the many pathogens and parasites afflicting honey bees, highlighting the biology of specific taxonomic groups mainly as they relate to virulence and possible defenses. Second, we describe physiological, immunological, and behavioral responses of individual bees toward pathogens and parasites. Third, bees also show behavioral mechanisms for reducing the disease risk of their nestmates. Accordingly, we discuss the dynamics of hygienic behavior and other group-level behaviors that can limit disease. Finally, we conclude with several avenues of research that seem especially promising for understanding host-parasite relationships in bees and for developing breeding or management strategies for enhancing honey bee health. We discuss how human efforts to maintain healthy colonies intersect with similar efforts by the bees, and how bee management and breeding protocols can affect disease traits in the short and long term.		animal, animal disease, animal husbandry, apiculture, article, bee, Dicistroviridae, disease transmission, epidemic, genetics, host parasite interaction, host pathogen interaction, immunology, innate immunity, methodology, microbiology, mite infestation, parasitology, pathogenicity, pathology, picornavirus infection, social behavior, virology, Animal Husbandry, Animals, Beekeeping, Bees, Dicistroviridae, Disease Outbreaks, Host-Parasite Interactions, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Immunity, Innate, Mite Infestations, Picornaviridae Infections, Social Behavior, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Dicistroviridae, Varroa	2010-01-01
Environmental impact of genetically modified maize expressing cry1 proteins	For more than a decade, genes of Bacillus thuringiensis (‘Bt’) that encode lepidopteran-specific protein toxins (Cry1Ab and Cry1F) have been engineered into maize for protection against lepidopteran pests. An extensive body of research data and environmental risk assessments (ERA) has been assembled on the potential environmental impact of Cry1 expressing maize. The available literature so far suggests only minor environmental effects. The majority of laboratory studies and all the field studies reviewed did not reveal any unexpected adverse or long-term effectson the environment. Negative effects observed in the laboratory do not necessarily translate to field conditions. There are more than 10 years experience of cultivating GM maize worldwide and few long-term effects have been reported. For future research studies, modelling and monitoring are appropriate tools to investigate long-term environmental effects during GMO cultivation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.			2010-01-01
An application of DPSIR framework to identify issues of pollinator loss	This paper is an attempt to apply the Driving forces-Pressures-State-Impact-Responses (DPSIR) framework to identify the issues of pollinator loss. The linkages between the significant pressures on insect pollinators, their underlying socio-economic driving forces and responses, with the focus on Europe, are addressed in the study. A review of literature revealed the shortage of empirical studies that prove direct links between policy responses and specific pressures on the pollinators. Based on written evidence and expert judgement, land use practices and the use of agrochemicals were regarded as the most significant pressures on different functional groups of pollinators. As demonstrated in the study, agricultural and rural development policy has been the key driving force of these pressures. The application of the DPSIR framework proved to be useful in identifying the pathway of human pressures on pollinators. The study also concludes that there is further need for specific empirical research on the effects and effectiveness of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) measures (agri-environment measures in particular) to support farming practices that facilitate the protection of the environment and the prevention of pollinator loss. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Honey bees health in Azapa valley, Region of Arica and Parinacota, Chile	To evaluate the presence of Varroa, American Loque and Nosema, two apiaries in Azapa valley -Arica and Parinacota region- were studied between June and December 2008. The presence of V. destructor was done according to the protocol established by the Agricultural and Cattle Service (SAG), the quantity of presence of foretics mites evaluated, determining an index of infestation. To evaluate the control of the mite, the oxalic and formic acid in independent treatments were tried. The presence of N. apis according to the procedure established by Calderón and collaborators was done. In addition, the digestive system of bees with symptoms was observed. The level of infection of the affected beehives was determined and Fumagilina B to control the disease was applied. In the region, the presence of American Loque was not registered. The products applied in the colonies behaved highly effective in the control of the registered diseases. The sanitary condition of the region is ideal for honey bees activity.			2009-10-20
Individual forager profits in Apis mellifera unaffected by a range of colony Varroa destructor densities	The parasitic mite Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman negatively affects honey bee health, flight activity, and foraging behavior, all of which can be expected to affect foraging energetics. We tested this hypothesis in a 3-year field study. In each year, four-frame nucleus colonies with varying loads of varroa were placed under cages with mature rabbiteye blueberry plants, Vaccinium ashei. Individual bee weights consistently decreased as colony varroa populations increased, affirming that the design produced a range of colony mite effects. However, average forager flower handling times and nectar ingestion rates were unaffected by changes in colony varroa levels. Moreover, there were no significant effects of colony varroa levels on individual net foraging energy gain determined per flower, per second handling time, or per second total foraging time. We conclude that individual forager profits in Apis mellifera are unaffected by the range of colony V. destructor densities used in this study. These results are relevant to the question of the extent to which foraging of individuals relates to colony state in social Hymenoptera. © Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel/Switzerland 2009.		colony structure, energetics, foraging behavior, handling time, honeybee, hypothesis testing, mite, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hymenoptera, Vaccinium, Vaccinium virgatum, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2009-10-01
Transgenic virus resistance in cultivated squash affects pollinator behaviour	Two ecological risks associated with the use of transgenic crops are transgene movement into wild populations and effects on non-target organisms, such as pollinators. Despite the importance of pollinators, and their contribution to the global food supply, little is known about how they are affected by transgenic crops. Pollinator preferences affect plant mating patterns; thus understanding the effects of transgenic crops on pollinators will aid in understanding transgene movement. 2. Honey bee and squash bee visit number and duration were recorded on conventional and transgenic virus-resistant squash Cucurbita pepo planted in a randomized block design. Floral characters were measured to explain differences in pollinator behaviour. The effect of Zucchini Yellow Mosaic Virus infection on pollinator behaviour was also examined. 3. Honey bees visited female conventional flowers more than female transgenic flowers. Conventional flowers were generally larger with more nectar than transgenic flowers, although floral traits did not account for differences in pollinator visitation. 4. Squash bees visited male transgenic flowers more than male conventional flowers; squash bees also spent more time in female transgenic flowers than in female conventional flowers. Transgenic flowers were significantly larger with greater amounts of sweeter nectar and they were present in greater number. Floral traits accounted for some of the variation in pollinator visitation. 5. Squash bee visit number and duration did not differ between virus-infected and healthy plants, but this may be because pollinator behaviour was observed early in the virus infection. 6. Synthesis and applications. Pollinator behaviour controls patterns of plant mating thus non-target effects of transgenic resistance, such as those observed here, may influence transgene movement into wild populations. These results suggest that transgenic crops should not be planted within the native range of wild relatives because pleiotropic effects may affect crop-wild hybridization and transgene introgression into wild populations. © 2009 British Ecological Society.		disease resistance, environmental risk, flower visiting, hybridization, introgression, nectar, nontarget organism, plant-pollinator interaction, pollinator, reproductive strategy, transgenic plant, vegetable, vine, virus, wild population, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Cucurbita pepo, Peponapis, Zucchini yellow mosaic virus	2009-10-01
Immune suppression in the honey bee (Apis mellifera) following infection by Nosema ceranae (Microsporidia)	Two microsporidia species have been shown to infect Apis mellifera, Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae. This work present evidence that N. ceranae infection significantly suppresses the honey bee immune response, although this effect was not observed following infection with N. apis. Immune suppression would also increase susceptibility to other bee pathogens and senescence. Despite the importance of both Nosema species in honey bee health, there is no information about their effect on the bees' immune system and present results can explain the different virulence between both microsporida infecting honeybees. © 2009 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.		antimicrobial cationic peptide, animal, article, bee, gene, gene expression regulation, genetics, immune deficiency, immunological tolerance, immunology, metabolism, microbiology, microsporidiosis, Nosema, pathogenicity, Animals, Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides, Bees, Gene Expression Regulation, Genes, Insect, Immune Tolerance, Immunocompromised Host, Microsporidiosis, Nosema, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Microsporidia, Nosema, Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae	2009-09-01
Colony collapse disorder: A descriptive study	Background: Over the last two winters, there have been large-scale, unexplained losses of managed honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies in the United States. In the absence of a known cause, this syndrome was named Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) because the main trait was a rapid loss of adult worker bees. We initiated a descriptive epizootiological study in order to better characterize CCD and compare risk factor exposure between populations afflicted by and not afflicted by CCD. Methods and Principal Findings:Of 61 quantified variables (including adult bee physiology, pathogen loads, and pesticide levels), no single measure emerged as a most-likely cause of CCD. Bees in CCD colonies had higher pathogen loads and were co-infected with a greater number of pathogens than control populations, suggesting either an increased exposure to pathogens or a reduced resistance of bees toward pathogens. Levels of the synthetic acaricide coumaphos (used by beekeepers to control the parasitic mite Varroa destructor) were higher in control colonies than CCD-affected colonies. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first comprehensive survey of CCD-affected bee populations that suggests CCD involves an interaction between pathogens and other stress factors. We present evidence that this condition is contagious or the result of exposure to a common risk factor. Potentially important areas for future hypothesis-driven research, including the possible legacy effect of mite parasitism and the role of honey bee resistance to pesticides, are highlighted.		acaricide, coumafos, pesticide residue, article, bacterium, body mass, colony collapse disorder, controlled study, descriptive research, epizootiology, genetic analysis, honeybee, host pathogen interaction, infestation, insect disease, insect resistance, insect society, insect virus, insecticide resistance, Kashmir bee virus, macroparasite, Melissococcus pluton, mite, mitotype, mixed infection, morphometrics, nonhuman, Nosema, organism colony, parasite prevalence, pathogenicity, protein analysis, risk factor, Animals, Bees, Population Density, United States, Acari, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Varroa destructor	2009-08-03
Genomic analyses of the microsporidian Nosema ceranae, an emergent pathogen of honey bees	Recent steep declines in honey bee health have severely impacted the beekeeping industry, presenting new risks for agricultural commodities that depend on insect pollination. Honey bee declines could reflect increased pressures from parasites and pathogens. The incidence of the microsporidian pathogen Nosema ceranae has increased significantly in the past decade. Here we present a draft assembly (7.86 MB) of the N. ceranae genome derived from pyrosequence data, including initial gene models and genomic comparisons with other members of this highly derived fungal lineage. N. ceranae has a strongly AT-biased genome (74% A+T) and a diversity of repetitive elements, complicating the assembly. Of 2,614 predicted protein-coding sequences, we conservatively estimate that 1,366 have homologs in the microsporidian Encephalitozoon cuniculi, the most closely related published genome sequence. We identify genes conserved among microsporidia that lack clear homology outside this group, which are of special interest as potential virulence factors in this group of obligate parasites. A substantial fraction of the diminutive N. ceranae proteome consists of novel and transposableelement proteins. For a majority of well-supported gene models, a conserved sense-strand motif can be found within 15 bases upstream of the start codon; a previously uncharacterized version of this motif is also present in E. cuniculi. These comparisons provide insight into the architecture, regulation, and evolution of microsporidian genomes, and will drive investigations into honey bee-Nosema interactions.		proteome, virulence factor, article, DNA extraction, DNA sequence, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, genetic analysis, genetic regulation, honeybee, nonhuman, Nosema, Nosema ceranae, nucleotide sequence, sequence alignment, start codon, TATA box, transposon, animal, bee, biological model, codon, fungal gene, fungal genome, fungus spore, genetics, metabolism, microbiology, molecular genetics, nucleotide repeat, pathogenicity, regulatory sequence, sequence homology, statistical analysis, Apis mellifera, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, Hexapoda, Microsporidia, Nosema, Nosema ceranae, Animals, Base Sequence, Bees, Codon, Conserved Sequence, Data Interpretation, Statistical, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, Genes, Fungal, Genome, Fungal, Models, Genetic, Molecular Sequence Data, Nosema, Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional, Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid, Sequence Alignment, Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid, Spores, Fungal	2009-06-01
"Entombed Pollen": A new condition in honey bee colonies associated with increased risk of colony mortality	Here we describe a new phenomenon, entombed pollen, which is highly associated with increased colony mortality. Entombed pollen is sunken, capped cells amidst "normal", uncapped cells of stored pollen, and some of the pollen contained within these cells is brick red in color. There appears to be a lack of microbial agents in the pollen, and larvae and adult bees do not have an increased rate of mortality when they are fed diets supplemented with entombed pollen in vitro, suggesting that the pollen itself is not directly responsible for increased colony mortality. However, the increased incidence of entombed pollen in reused wax comb suggests that there is a transmittable factor common to the phenomenon and colony mortality. In addition, there were elevated pesticide levels, notably of the fungicide chlorothalonil, in entombed pollen. Additional studies are needed to determine if there is a causal relationship between entombed pollen, chemical residues, and colony mortality. © 2009.		pesticide residue, animal, article, bee, growth, development and aging, honey, larva, mortality, physiology, pollen, risk factor, Animals, Bees, Honey, Larva, Mortality, Pesticide Residues, Pollen, Risk Factors, Apis mellifera, Apoidea	2009-06-01
Colony collapse disorder action plan	Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), a significant disappearance of honey bee colonies that may be affecting bees in more than 22 states, threatens the production of crops dependent on bees for pollination as well as honey production. Pollination is responsible for $15 billion in added crop value, particularly for specialty crops such as nuts, berries, fruits, and vegetables. Of the 2.4 million colonies of bees in the United States, the almond crop in California alone requires 1.3 million colonies, and this need is projected to increase significantly over the next few years. The bee industry is facing difficulty meeting the demand for pollination in almonds because of bee production shortages in California. Consequently, growers depend increasingly on beekeepers from other states to transport honey bee colonies across the country to meet the pollination demand (a phenomenon known as migratory beekeeping). If researchers cannot find a solution to CCD, beekeepers will be unable to meet demand for this and other crops. Current theories about the cause(s) of CCD include increased losses due to the invasive varroa mite; new or emerging diseases, especially mortality by a new Nosema species (related to the microporidian giardia); and pesticide poisoning (through exposure to pesticides applied for crop pest control or for in-hive insect or mite control). In addition to these suspects, perhaps the most highly-suspected cause of CCD is a potential immune-suppressing stress on bees, caused by one or a combination of several factors. Stresses may include poor nutrition (due to apiary overcrowding, pollination of crops with low nutritional value, or pollen or nectar dearth), drought, and migratory stress brought about by the increased need to move bees long distances to provide pollination services (which, by confining bees during transport, or increasing contact among colonies in different hives, increases the transmission of pathogens). Researchers suspect that stress could be compromising the immune system of bees, making colonies more susceptible to disease. Following the ad hoc formation of a CCD Working Team (a rapid response group comprised of academic, private, and Federal scientists), the Department of Agriculture (USDA) took the lead in the effort to determine causes contributing to CCD. Specifically, USDA organized a two-day CCD Workshop in Beltsville, Maryland, for various apiculture experts to identify research gaps and priorities as well as measures required to address these needs. Based on information gathered at the Workshop, a newly formed CCD Steering Committee, composed of Federal program leaders and Land Grant University scientists/administrators, identified critical research and response needs and developed an Action Plan. Direction of research to bee decline and protecting bee health has been accompanied by considerable direction of Federal resources. In fiscal year (FY) 2007, ARS had a honey bee research budget of $7.7 million, the focus of research being on controlling the varroa mite pest and microbial pathogens and on improving honey bee nutrition. Between FY 2000 and FY 2006, the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) spent an average of $1.7 million per year on honey bee and pollinator research; roughly one third to one half of this funding was spent on research on honey bee health. Additional funds are now being directed by ARS' Areawide Integrated Pest Management program to conduct a full-scale areawide project on honey bee health in the amount of $1 million per year for the next 5 years. Meanwhile, CSREES has tapped $117,000 in unexpended funds from the Critical and Emerging Issues Program to provide seed grants for CCD. In addition, CSREES is tentatively planning to direct additional funds in FY 2008. Land Grant University Experiment Stations have committed to the support of a new Multi-state Rapid Response Research project administered by the North Central region through the Hatch Multi-state Research allocation. This project will begin in FY 2008 and will include scientists throughout the United States. Furthermore, extension specialists are active in every State and many have specific responsibilities to apiculture. Many of their activities are supported by Federal Smith-Lever appropriations to States for the Cooperative Extension System. The current strategy for addressing the CCD crisis involves four main components: 1) survey and data collection; 2) analysis of samples; 3) hypothesis-driven research; and, 4) mitigation and preventative action. Within each component topic area in this Plan, we have outlined the current status of ongoing research and future plans needed to address the problem of poor honey bee health, as well as the organizations(s) that will be involved in the effort. Furthermore, this plan identifies many areas of research where specific expertise is lacking, and it recommends longterm capacity building in these areas, accomplished through the hiring of new scientists. Finally, as noted in a 2006 National Academy of Sciences study on the status of bee populations in North America, honey bee health has been in decline for several years-long before the appearance of CCD-and a concerted, well-funded research and extension effort is urgently needed to ensure the viability of these essential pollinators in U. S. agriculture. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.			2009-01-01
Profiles of the body-surface proteolytic system of honey bee queens, workers and drones: Ontogenetic and seasonal changes in proteases and their natural inhibitors	We describe how protease and protease inhibitor activity patterns vary during ontogenesis, with season, and in relation to caste and sex in the honey bee (Apis mellifera). Extraction of body surfaces with water and detergent was followed by the in vitro analysis of proteolytic activity and protease inhibitor level, as well as the electrophoretic separation of extracts in polyacrylamide gels. In in vitro experiments, we compared two groups of detectable proteolytic activities: neutral and alkaline water-soluble versus acidic detergent-soluble. The most active proteases appeared to be acidic ones and were detected on drone pupae in spring. The most distinct and most active protease bands in electrophoretic separations were those obtained for neutral and alkaline activities on queens in all seasons. The highest levels of protease inhibitor activities in vitro were obtained from worker samples in all seasons. The enzymatic properties suggest that all catalytic types of proteases were present in the extracts, but at different activity levels, depending on pH: asparagine and cysteine proteases at pH 2.5, cysteine proteases and metalloproteases at pH 7.0, and serine proteases at pH 11.5, respectively. © INRA.		acidity, amino acid, detergent, electrokinesis, enzyme activity, experimental study, honeybee, ontogeny, pH, polymer, queen, seasonal variation, separation, sex-related difference, Apis mellifera	2009-01-01
Recent honey bee colony declines	In 2006, commercial migratory beekeepers along the East Coast of the United States began reporting sharp declines in their honey bee colonies. Because of the severity and unusual circumstances of these colony declines, scientists have named this phenomenon Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Reports indicate that beekeepers in 35 states have been affected. Overall, bee colony losses averaged about 30% in 2007. Reports for 2008 show continued declines with estimated average annual losses nationwide approaching 35%. Honey bees are the most economically valuable pollinators of agricultural crops worldwide. Many scientists at universities and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) frequently assert that bee pollination is involved in about one-third of the U.S. diet, and contributes to the production of a wide range of fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, forage crops, some field crops, and other specialty crops. The monetary value of honey bees as commercial pollinators in the United States is estimated at about $15 billion annually. Honey bee colony losses are not uncommon. However, current losses seem to differ from past situations in that colony losses are occurring mostly because bees are failing to return to the hive (which is largely uncharacteristic of bee behavior); bee colony losses have been rapid; colony losses are occurring in large numbers; and the reason(s) for these losses remains largely unknown. The potential causes of CCD, as reported by the scientists who are researching this phenomenon, include but may not be limited to • parasites, mites, and disease loads in the bees and brood; • emergence of new or newly more virulent pathogens; • poor nutrition among adult bees; • lack of genetic diversity and lineage of bees; • level of stress in adult bees (e.g., transportation and confinement of bees, overcrowding, or other environmental or biological stressors); • chemical residue/contamination in the wax, food stores, and/or bees; • a combination of these and/or other factors. In 2007, the House held two subcommittee hearings to review the recent honey bee colony declines and to address concerns about pollinator health. In 2008, the Senate hosted a briefing on pollinators and their role in agricultural security. Various policy options were discussed at these hearings and briefings, including increasing federal funding for research and monitoring, providing technical support and assistance for beekeepers, and emphasizing the importance of pollinator diversity and sustaining wild and native pollinator species. The enacted 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-234) contains provisions that would, among other things, provide additional funding for research and conservation programs addressing honey bees and pollinators. In 2006, commercial migratory beekeepers along the East Coast of the United States began reporting sharp declines in their honey bee colonies. Because of the severity and unusual circumstances of these colony declines, scientists have named this phenomenon Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Reports indicate that beekeepers in 35 states have been affected. Recent surveys indicate that about one-half of surveyed beekeepers have experienced "abnormal" or "severe" colony losses. This report provides an overview of the importance of honey bee pollination to U.S. agricultural production, especially specialty crops. It describes the extent and symptoms of CCD and how it differs from previous honey bee colony losses, describing some of the reasons why scientists believe honey bee colonies are being affected by CCD. Finally, this report discusses policy options and subsequent action that Congress could consider in this area. In March 2007, the House Subcommittee on Horticulture and Organic Agriculture held a hearing to review the recent honey bee colony declines. In June 2007, the Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, and Oceans of the House Committee on Natural Resources held a hearing on the role of pollinators in ecosystem health, which also addressed concerns about bee colony declines. In April 2008, Chairwoman Barbara Boxer and other members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hosted a briefing on pollinators and their role in agricultural security. These hearings and briefings presented a range of policy options. The enacted 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-234) contains provisions that would, among other things, provide additional funding for research and conservation programs addressing honey bees and pollinators. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Effects of dietary transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis Maize pollen on hive worker honeybees	To assess potential impacts of transgenic insect-resistant (MON 863 × MON 810) Bt maize-pollen consumption on hive honeybees, two-, three-, four- and five-day-old workers were fed during five days with a mixture of honey and sugar (Control, Group I), honey with non-transgenic Limagrain maize pollen (Group II) and honey with Bacillus thuringiensis maize pollen (Group III). The consumption rate, weight of bees, protein content, antioxidant enzyme activities and total antioxidant status were estimated. There were no significant differences in any of the above parameters among the groups of bees fed on the three diets. Only trehalose and maltose levels were higher in bees fed a pollen-free control diet compared to bees fed either transgenic or non-transgenic maize pollen. Our data indicate that the transgenic pollen had no adverse impact on studied markers of young hive honeybees.		Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Bacillus thuringiensis, Hexapoda, Zea mays	2008-12-01
Does fumagillin control the recently detected invasive parasite Nosema ceranae in western honey bees (Apis mellifera)?	Western honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies in Nova Scotia, Canada were sampled in spring and late summer 2007 to evaluate efficacy of fumagillin dicyclohexylammonium (hereafter, fumagillin) against Nosema ceranae. Colonies treated with fumagillin in September 2006 (n = 94) had significantly lower Nosema intensity in spring 2007 than did colonies that received no treatment (n = 51), but by late summer 2007 no difference existed between groups. Molecular sequencing of 15 infected colonies identified N. ceranae in 93.3% of cases, suggesting that fumagillin is successful at temporarily reducing this recent invasive parasite in western honey bees. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Impact of insecticidal proteins expressed in transgenic plants on bumblebee microcolonies	In order to assess the risk that insecticidal transgenic plants may pose for bumblebees, we tested whether Bombus terrestris (L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) workers are able to detect insecticidal proteins dissolved in sucrose solution and whether consumption of these proteins will affect survival and offspring production. Feeders containing either Bacillus thuringiensis toxin (Cry1Ab), Kunitz soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), or Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) were offered to bumblebee colonies at low (0.01% wt/vol for SBTI and GNA, 0.001% for Cry1Ab) and high concentrations (0.1% for SBTI and GNA, 0.01% for Cry1Ab) together with a control (pure sucrose solution) in a glasshouse chamber. No difference was found in the number of visits and the duration of visits among the different concentrations for each of the insecticidal proteins, indicating that bumblebees do not discriminate the compounds. To investigate the impact of the different insecticidal proteins on B. terrestris, microcolonies were established by placing three newly emerged bumblebee workers in wooden boxes. Within a few days, a hierarchy in each microcolony was established and the dominant worker developed its ovaries and laid haploid eggs. Bumblebees were fed with Cry1Ab (0.01%), SBTI, or GNA (both at 0.01 and 0.1%) dissolved in sucrose solution and also fed mixed floral pollen for a maximum period of 80 days. Additionally, microcolonies with three drones each were established to measure individual bee longevity. While the Cry1Ab did not affect microcolony performance, the consumption of SBTI and especially GNA affected survival of B. terrestris workers and drones and caused a significant reduction in the number of offspring. The use of microcolonies appears to be well-suited to measure lethal and sublethal effects of insecticidal proteins expressed in transgenic plants on bumblebees. © 2008 The Authors.		bee, enzyme activity, experimental study, flower visiting, gene expression, inhibitor, insecticide, longevity, protein, risk assessment, sucrose, survival, toxin, transgenic plant, worker caste, Apidae, Apoidea, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bombus terrestris, Galanthus, Galanthus nivalis, Glycine max, Hymenoptera	2008-02-01
Comparison of parasitic mites in Russian-hybrid and Italian honey bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) colonies across three different locations in North Carolina	The most economically important parasites of honey bee, Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), colonies are the parasitic mites Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman and Acarapis woodi (Rennie). Research has shown that mite-tolerant stocks are effective means to reduce mite infestations within colonies, but it is unclear whether the stocks available commercially are viable means of mite control because they are likely to be genetic hybrids. We compared colonies of a standard commercial stock ("Italian") with those of a commercially purchased mite-tolerant stock ("Russian") for their levels of varroa and "tracheal" mites (A. woodi) over the course of 2 yr in three different geographic locations. We were unable to detect significant infestations of tracheal mites; thus, we were unable to adequately compare the stocks for their tolerance. In contrast, we found significant differences in the levels of varroa mites within and among colonies located across the three different study sites for both years. By the end of the first year, we found statistically significant differences between the stocks in varroa mite intensity (mites per adult bee), such that Russian-hybrid colonies tended to have a significantly lower proportion of parasitized adult bees than Italian colonies. In the second year, we found statistically significant differences between the stocks in varroa mite load (daily mite drop), such that Russian-hybrid colonies tended to have lower total numbers of mites than Italian colonies. These findings suggest that beekeepers may benefit by incorporating commercially purchased mite-tolerant stocks into their existing integrated pest management programs. © 2007 Entomological Society of America.		animal, article, bee, comparative study, genetics, hybridization, mite, parasitology, pest control, physiology, United States, Animals, Bees, Hybridization, Genetic, Mites, North Carolina, Pest Control, Acarapis woodi, Acari, Apidae, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hymenoptera, Varroa, Varroa destructor	2007-04-01
Ecological impacts of genetically modified crops: Ten years of field research and commercial cultivation	The worldwide commercial cultivation of genetically modified (GM) crops has raised concerns about potential adverse effects on the environment resulting from the use of these crops. Consequently, the risks of GM crops for the environment, and especially for biodiversity, have been extensively assessed before and during their commercial cultivation. Substantial scientific data on the environmental effects of the currently commercialized GM crops are available today. We have reviewed this scientific knowledge derived from the past 10∈years of worldwide experimental field research and commercial cultivation. The review focuses on the currently commercially available GM crops that could be relevant for agriculture in Western and Central Europe (i.e., maize, oilseed rape, and soybean), and on the two main GM traits that are currently commercialized, herbicide tolerance (HT) and insect resistance (IR). The sources of information included peer-reviewed scientific journals, scientific books, reports from regions with extensive GM crop cultivation, as well as reports from international governmental organizations. The data available so far provide no scientific evidence that the cultivation of the presently commercialized GM crops has caused environmental harm. Nevertheless, a number of issues related to the interpretation of scientific data on effects of GM crops on the environment are debated controversially. The present review highlights these scientific debates and discusses the effects of GM crop cultivation on the environment considering the impacts caused by cultivation practices of modern agricultural systems. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.		herbicide, article, crop, drug effect, drug resistance, ecosystem, genetics, insecticide resistance, transgenic plant, Crops, Agricultural, Drug Resistance, Ecosystem, Herbicides, Insecticide Resistance, Plants, Genetically Modified, Brassica napus, Glycine max, Hexapoda, Zea mays	2007-03-31
Assessment of Canadian federal and provincial legislation to conserve native and managed pollinators	Declining pollinator numbers in Canada is an issue of concern requiring active conservation of native, wild, and managed species. Federal and provincial legislation was examined to determine whether Canada has the capacity to manage native pollinators. Hard legislation was chosen based on its potential to contain provisions for pollinator protection. The wording, specific statements within each act, and the context in which they are used, were examined. The legislation was categorized into one of three classes: a) has explicit provisions for pollinator conservation, b) is related to, but no explicit provisions are present, c) has nothing to do widi pollinator conservation. Results showed that Canada has inadequate legislative provisions for native pollinator conservation at the federal and provincial level. There are few specific provisions dealing directly wim native pollinators, but some legislation alludes to it. Existing legislation pertains to the protection of managed pollinators, especially the western honeybee (Apis mellifera). Therefore, such provincial acts could be amended to include all native bees and other pollinator species to ensure that their ecological and agricultural services continue. The federal National Parks Act and the Species at Risk Act (and their provincial counterparts) could be amended similarly. Effective pollinator conservation requires management, research, education and monitoring, but the enabling legislative provisions should be created for this to happen.		assessment method, bee, legislation, pollinator, population decline, species conservation, Canada, North America, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Hexapoda	2007-03-01
Oxytetracycline-resistance in the honey bee pathogen paenibacillus larvae is encoded on novel plasmid pMA67	The gram-positive bacterium, Paenibacillus larvae, causes a serious honey bee disease, American Foulbrood. For several decades, commercial and hobbyist beekeepers have controlled this disease with the antibiotic oxytetracycline. However, in recent years there have been reports of oxytetracycline-resistant P. larvae. In this study, we report that the reason for the oxytetracycline resistance in P. larvae is the presence of a novel plasmid carrying a tetracycline resistance gene–tetL. We tested 36 strains of P. larvae from the USA and Canada and found this plasmid in all 21 oxytetracycline-resistant strains and in none of the 15 oxytetracycline-sensitive strains. We cloned and expressed the P. larvae tetL gene in Escherichia coli and showed it was functional. Sequencing of the entire plasmid, which we named pMA67, revealed that it is likely a mobilizable rolling-circle replication plasmid. This work provides the first sequence information for any P. larvae plasmid, a new tetL ortholog with significant sequence divergence from tetL genes found in other species, and the first tetracycline-resistance gene found in the entire Paenibacillus genus. © 2006 International Bee Research Association.

Communal use of integumental wounds in honey bee (Apis mellifera) pupae multiply infested by the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor	The ectoparasitic bee mite, Varroa destructor, is highly adapted to its natural and adopted honey bee hosts, Apis cerana and Apis mellifera. Adult females perforate the integument of bee pupae in such a way that they and their progeny can feed. We examined the wounds that founder females made, and usually found one, and rarely up to three, integumental wounds on pupae of A. mellifera multiply infested by V. destructor. The punctures were mainly on the 2nd abdominal sternite of the host. These perforations are used repeatedly as feeding sites by these hemolymph-sucking mites and by their progeny. The diameter of the wounds increased during pupal development. In brood cells containing 4-5 invading female mites and their progeny, healing of the wound is delayed, normally occurring just before the imaginal moult of the bee pupa. These wounds are subject to microbial infections, and they are relevant to the evolution of behavioral traits in these parasitic mites and their relations to host bees.		adaptive behavior, article, biological trait, controlled study, ectoparasite, female, honeybee, host parasite interaction, infestation, integument, mite, molting, nonhuman, varroa destructor, wound healing, wound infection, Animals, Bees, Bites and Stings, Feeding Behavior, Female, Host-Parasite Relations, Male, Microscopy, Electron, Scanning, Mites, Pupa, Trypan Blue, Acari, Apis cerana, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Varroa destructor	2005-08-09
Can almond nectar &amp; pollen poison honey bees?	A number of plants produce nectar or pollen that contains toxins which can adversely affect honey bees. Almond (Amygdalus communis L. (Rosaceae)) produces amygdalin, a toxic cyanoglycoside, in its nectar and pollen. Although beekeepers regard almond as a valuable nectar and pollen plant, and honey bees are deployed extensively for almond pollination, prolonged reliance on almond may be detrimental to honey bees' health. Our results suggest that almond nectar is not sufficiently rich in amygdalin to pose a hazard, but that almond pollen could be toxic if exclusively consumed by honey bees for much more than a week. Further tests are needed to determine if honey bees in almond orchards are at risk, or if they somehow cope with the toxin.		Apinae, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Prunus dulcis, Rosaceae	2005-06-01
Inhibition of the American foulbrood bacterium, paenibacillus larvae larvae, by bacteria isolated from honey bees	While honey bees (Apis mellifera) support a diverse microbial community, the impacts of most of their associated microbes on honey bee health remain unresolved. Here, pairwise inhibition assays were used to identify honey bee bacterial symbionts that inhibit a primary pathogen, the Gram-positive bacterium Paenibacillus larvae larvae. Four bacterial taxa isolated from bee larvae appeared especially promising with respect to inhibition of P. l. larvae and, in fact, completely inhibited P. l. larvae growth in pairwise plate assays. These isolates were identified by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter sp., Brevibacillus formosus and Bacillus fusiformis. A PCR-based survey confirmed that these bacterial isolates are present in bee larvae, at frequencies ranging from 2% (1/48) for B. formosus to 79% (39/48) for Acinetobacter sp. An understanding of the distributions of these co-occurring bacteria could elucidate variation across colonies in susceptibility to American foulbrood disease. In addition, supplementation of colonies with these naturally occurring bacteria or their antagonistic products can provide a novel way of controlling foulbrood disease. © 2005 International Bee Research Association.

Potential effects of GM crops on honey bee health	Recent increases in the global area planted in GM crops have been accompanied by rising public awareness of agricultural practices and concern about the environment. Honey bees are widely recognized as important beneficial insects. In most countries, regulators assessing potential risks and benefits from GM plants list the honey bee among the 'non-target' species that need to be considered before these plants are released. Research on honey bees and GM crops has focused on the presence of GM material in honey, the roles that bees may play in the flow of genes from GM crops, and the potential impacts of GM plants on bee health. This article summarizes research on bee health and GM. There is now a considerable body of knowledge on this topic and some well-established techniques for assessing risks to bees before new plants are released.

Imidacloprid, potatoes, and honey bees in Atlantic Canada: Is there a connection?	In 2000, some beekeepers in Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada, experienced substantial, unexplainable honey bee colony losses. Prince Edward Island is an Atlantic Canadian province of approximately 5, 684 km2 with about 261, 482 hectares (46%) of its land base involved in agriculture, and about 135, 600 hectares of this agricultural land is in rotation with potato crops (extrapolated from PEI Agricultural Statistics for 1999). About 90% of the potato crop is treated with imidacloprid in-furrow. Some beekeepers in France felt that imidacloprid use on sunflower crops was negatively affecting honey bee health in that country. Beekeepers who experienced the high colony mortality on Prince Edward Island wanted this possible connection investigated as well. Their concerns were heard, and as a consequence, a residue study was done in 2001. The results did not show detectable residues of imidacloprid or two of its metabolites in bee forage plants or hive products at the limit of quantification of 2 ppb. Unexplained and substantial honey bee colony losses continue to plaque and mystify some beekeepers around the world. With increasing demand for honey bees for pollination of fruit crops in Atlantic Canada, this problem is a very real concern. Therefore, a comprehensive, mulitfactor investigation was initiated in the spring of 2002. Project planning input was sought from beekeepers, and partnerships with beekeeper associations, producer organizations, individuals, corporations, institutions and governments were developed. The final version of the project includes seven major components which encompass many of the factors that beekeepers agree can negatively impact honey bee health. Also, these factors are in agreement with those listed in a Canadian Association of Professional Apiculturists (CAPA)/Canadian Honey Council (CHC) joint committee recommendation regarding the need for broad, factor based studies. The results of the 2001 investigation, and the methodologies of the 2002/2003 multi-factor study are presented.

Prospective biological control agents of Varroa destructor n. sp., an important pest of the European honeybee, Apis mellifera	This paper reviews prospective biological control agents of the varroa mite, Varroa destructor n. sp. (Acari, Mesostigmata). This ectoparasite has caused severe damage to populations of the European honeybee, Apis mellifera, world-wide in recent years. To date, no promising natural enemies of varroa species have been identified on A. mellifera or its original host, Apis cerana. Therefore, biological control will probably require natural enemies from other hosts. The following groups of organisms were reviewed as potential biological control agents: predatory mites, parasitoids and entomopathogens (nematodes, protozoa, viruses, Bacillus thuringiensis, rickettsiae, and fungi). The candidate groups were ranked according to their lethality to Acari, likely ability to operate under the physical conditions of honeybee colonies, ease of targeting, and ease of mass-production. Preferential consideration was given to the natural enemies of Acari that occupy taxonomic groups close to varroa. Entomopathogenic fungi, which kill a wide range of acarine species, were identified as prime candidates for screening against varroa. Bacillus thuringiensis also requires study, particularly strains producing novel toxins active against non-insect hosts. Entomopathogenic protozoa and nematodes show less potential for varroa control, but nonetheless warrant preliminary investigation. We consider predators, parasitoids, viruses and rickettsiae to have little potential to control varroa. Because the physical conditions within honeybee colonies are similar everywhere, it is very likely that a biological control agent of varroa could be used successfully throughout the world.		biocontrol agent, biological pest control, Europe, host, natural enemy, parasitism, pest control, predation, predator prey interaction, biocontrol agent, biological control, ectoparasite, honeybee	2001-01-01
Occurrence of acute paralysis virus of the honey bee (Apis mellifera) in a Hungarian apiary infested with the parasitic mite Varroa jacobsoni	Viruses of the honey bee have been known for a long time; however, recently the attention of scientists and apiculturalists has turned towards the relationship between these viruses and the parasitic mite Varroa jacobsoni. Although clinical symptoms indicated the presence of some of the viruses of bees in Hungary, none have previously been isolated or identified. During July unusual adult bee and brood mortality was observed in some colonies of an apiary in Budapest known to be infested with Varroa jacobsoni. Large amounts of acute paralysis virus (APV) were detected serologically in healthy honey bee pupae killed by the injection of a bacteria-free extract of diseased adult bees. Crystalline arrays of 30 nm particles were seen in ultrathin sections of the tissues of injected pupae and naturally infected adult bees. In spite of the application of acaricide treatments the bee population in several colonies had collapsed by the end of summer and the apiary suffered severe wintering losses.
