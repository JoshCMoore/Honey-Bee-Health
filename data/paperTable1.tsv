The deutocerebrum of the cockroach Blaberus craniifer burm. Spatial organization of the sensory glomeruli	The objective of this work is to describe the glomerular organization of the deutocerebrum in Blaberus craniifer and to test the hypothesis that the glomeruli are identifiable. The problem is studied using the techniques of analytical geometry, i.e., by measuring the location of the glomeruli in cartesian coordinate systems. Computerized geometrical and statistical techniques are described for the three‐dimensional reconstruction and quantitative study of these brain structures. The invariance of the glomerular organization, and consequently the identifiability of the glomeruli, is based on three criteria: (1) the number of glomeruli per hemideutocerebrum (hDTC) is a constant (109); (2) the position of the glomeruli is symmetrical in the two sides of one individual and identical in the same side of two individuals, except for small local variations, (3) the dimensions of two positionally homologous glomeruli are statistically equal in the same and in different individuals, except for a macroglomerulus which is found only in the male. The causes of variability, from experimental and biological origin, are discussed and quantitatively evaluated. The interindividual biological variability, not ascribable to differences in size between brains, expressed as a 95% interval, is estimated to be 27 μm for the location of glomeruli and 12 μm for the diameter of glomeruli.

The effect of huddling on thermoregulation and oxygen consumption for the naked mole-rat	1. 1. Individual and huddled naked mole-rats became progressively hypothermic at lowered ambient temperatures; tb = 20.6 + 0.41 Ta. 2. 2. Oxygen consumption of individual mole-rats increased more than that of huddled mole-rats at Ta < 34°C. 3. 3. Huddling behaviour considerably reduced the mass-specific thermal conductance from 0.25 ml O2 g-1 °C-1 (individual) to 0.12 (group of four) at Ta = 20°C. 4. 4. Thus, huddled mole-rats are unlike other endotherms since they maintain the same Tb as individuals but at a reduced metabolic cost. 5. 5. Huddled mole-rats had lower rates of evaporative water loss than individuals, at high Ta because of their lower exposed surface area and VO2 (per individual). © 1980.			1980-01-01
Corpora Cardiaca‐Allata Complex of the Larvae of the Pink Bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella. An Ultrastructural Study in Relation to Diapause	Raina, A. K., Borg, T. K. 1980. Corpora cardiaca‐allata complex of the larvae of the pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella. An ultrastructural study in relation to diapause. (Department of Entomology, North Dakota State University of South Carolina, School of Medicine, Columbia, U.S.A.) — Acta zool. (Stockh.) 61(2): 65–77. The corpora cardiaca (CC) and corpora allata (CA) of the pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella, were studied at the ultrastructural level during induction maintenance, and termination of larval diapause. The CC is composed of 5–6 intrinsic secretory (IS) cells, glial cells, and axons that carry electron dense (ED) and electron lucent (EL) granules from the brain. The IS cells produce ED granules with an average diameter of 110 ± 26 nm. During diapause, the axons with ED granules showed large accumulations of neurosecretory granules, but the axons with the EL granules contained lesser amounts. The CA is made up of approximately 25 large cells and axons that pass through the CC from the brain. Most of the axons take up a peripheral position. A characteristic feature of CA cells during diapause was the presence of stacks of convoluted tubules of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) that may be associated with juvenile hormone synthesis. The IS cells of the CC appeared to be inactive during diapause. 1980 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences			1980-01-01
Genetic distance: A simple quantitative measure of biological relatedness	We propose a new quantitative method of establishing the biological relatedness of two organisms, by means of comparison of the experimentally observed, differential-melting-curves of their DNAs which are assumed to depend on the detailed structure of the corresponding base pair sequences. In the light of recent experimental and theoretical results discussed in this paper, this assumption seems to be well justified. In the case of viruses and bacteria, analysis of available experimental data, demonstrates the straightforward applicability of the method in quantitative determinations of relatedness. In spite of certain difficulties arising in the application of the method to eucaryotes, we believe that it still could serve in obtaining at least first-order estimates of eucaryotic relatedness. © 1980, All rights reserved.		genetic distance, heredity, methodology, Eukaryota	1980-01-01
A hemolytic polypeptide from the venom of the red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus	The venom of Pogonomyrmex barbatus was analyzed with a view to elucidating the chemical nature of the agent responsible for direct hemolysis. Gel filtration experiments indicated the mol. wt of the active substance, termed barbatolysin, to be ca. 3000. Barbatolysin was isolated in nearly pure form by isoelectric focusing and was found to be a strongly basic polypeptide containing 34 amino acid residues. The relative susceptibility of erythrocytes from different animals was compared using venoms of P. barbatus, P. badius and Apis mellifera. Barbatolysin was not lethal for mice, but mouse lethality was associated with a second venom component having an isoelectric pH of 8·0 and a mol. wt of 8000. The information obtained suggests that there is a functional resemblance between the venoms of P. barbatus and A. mellifera with respect to direct-acting hemolysins. © 1980.		ant venom, hemolysin, insect venom, animal experiment, barbatolysin, blood and hemopoietic system, drug analysis, drug toxicity, hemolysis, intoxication, mouse, Amino Acids, Animal, Ant Venoms, Arthropod Venoms, Cattle, Dogs, Erythrocytes, Goats, Guinea Pigs, Hemolysins, Hemolysis, Horses, Human, In Vitro, Isoelectric Focusing, Lethal Dose 50, Mice, Peptides, Rabbits, Rats, Sheep, Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.	1980-01-01
The effects of honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) venom and two of its constituents, melittin and phospholipase A<inf>2</inf>, on the cardiovascular system of the rat	The cardiovascular effects of whole lyophilised honey bee venom and its major constituents, melittin and phosphatidate 2-acylhydrolase, EC 3.1.1.4 (phospholipase A2) have been studied in the anaesthetised rat and on the isolated perfused rat heart. Single bolus injections of whole venom (5-20 μg) irreversibly paralysed the isolated heart in 30-60 sec; perfusion of lower concentrations (1-8 μg/g tissue/min) caused paralysis over longer periods. In the whole animal, bee venom produced two differing responses on blood pressure depending on resting levels. In animals with a mean blood pressure of 95/67 mmHg, venom (0·5 mg/kg body weight) caused an increase of about 20 mmHg in 30 sec; in animals with a mean blood pressure of 138/112 mmHg, venom (0·7 mg/kg body weight) caused a marked fall. In both cases blood pressure returned to pre-venom levels after 5 min. Electrocardiographic changes were noted 15-20 min after envenomation, principally T wave elevation followed by ST-segment depression. The majority of these effects can be ascribed to the main constituents of honey bee venom; melittin (20-40 μg) irreversibly paralysed the isolated heart in 37-64 sec, phospholipase A2 was inactive. In the anaesthetised animal, melittin (200 μg/kg) slightly increased blood pressure but did not invariably affect ECG, whereas phospholipase A2 was profoundly hypotensive. The cardiotoxicity of melittin was less marked in the whole animal. © 1980.		hymenoptera venom, metformin, phospholipase a, animal experiment, arthropod, blood pressure, cardiotoxicity, cardiovascular system, drug comparison, drug toxicity, electrocardiography, heart, heart rate, honeybee, in vitro study, intoxication, rat, short survey, Anesthesia, Animal, Bee Venoms, Heart, Hemodynamics, Male, Melitten, Pentobarbital, Phospholipases, Phospholipases A, Rats, Urethane	1980-01-01
The toxicity of diflubenzuron to honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies in apple orchards	The effect of diflubenzuron on honey bees in apple orchards in southeastern England was studied in 1976. In two experiments apple trees cv. Cox's Orange Pippin, in full flower and with honey bees foraging on the blossom, were sprayed with diflubenzuron at 0.11, 0.20 or 0.40 kg a.i.†/ha, HCH at 0.25 kg a.i./ha or malathion at 2.52 kg a.i./ha. Diflubenzuron did not reduce the numbers of adult or larval bees, whereas HCH or malathion killed many adult bees. In a third experiment in 1978 in eastern England diflubenzuron at 0.22 kg a.i./ha was sprayed on to bees returning to their hive. Neither adult nor larval bees were killed by this treatment. Small quantities (0.11 and 0.30 μg/g) of diflubenzuron were found in samples of honey from hives sited in plots treated with this insecticide. Copyright © 1980, Wiley Blackwell.

Amino Acids in Pollens and Nectars of Citrus Cultivars and in Stored Pollen and Honey from Honeybee Colonies in Citrus Groves	Total amino acids and crude protein levels were analysed in pollens from flowers of nine citrus cultivars, and in stored pollen from three honeybee colonies in citrus groves. Free amino acids were determined in the nectars from six cultivars and in three citrus honeys. Although the protein levels of pollens from different cultivars ranged from 6·2% to 20·7%, the percentage of individual amino acids was relatively constant. Aspartic acid and glutamic acid were the predominant amino acids in the pollen from flowers. Stored pollen contained 17·1% to 22·6% protein, and higher amounts of proline than flower pollen. Nectars contained 7·5 to 79·1 mg/100 g of amino acids. Wide variation was observed both in the numbers and in the levels of amino acids in the nectars. In nectars in which they were found, proline and serine were the predominant amino acids. In contrast, the kinds and amounts of amino acids were fairly constant in the honey samples, proline being the major one. Unlike most plants, Citrus has low levels of proline in pollen and high levels in nectar. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01

Immunochemical and electrophoretic identification of the vitellogenin proteins of the queen bee (Apis mellifera)	1. 1. Vitellogenin was localized in laying queens' and workers' ovaries and in eggs using antisera against emerging and laying queens' ovaries in double-diffusion, immunoelectrophoresis and radioimmunoelectrophoresis analyses. 2. 2. Vitellogenin was preparatively separated by polyacrylamide gradient (5-11%) gel electrophoresis as band X, and the eluate was used to prepare antiserum against vitellogenin. 3. 3. Vitellogenins were detected in the haemolymph of both laying and non-laying females of the two castes, but not in that of drones. 4. 4. Vitellogenin was separated by isoelectric focusing into 9 components with pI values between 5.9 and 7.2. 5. 5. Vitellogenin (band X) was separated into 26 components by SDS-polyacrylamide gradient (5-15%) gel electrophoresis. 6. 6. Female-specific proteins were present in the haemolymph of the two castes, but only a part of them were vitellogenins. 7. 7. Vitellogenins were found in the fat body and ovaries of laying queens, but not in those of emerging ones. 8. 8. No vitellogenin was found in royal jelly nor in the mid-gut of laying queens. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Queen pheromone transfer within honeybee colonies	ABSTRACT. The observations provided strong circumstantial evidence that workers in a queen's court obtain queen pheromone on their antennae, and that queen pheromone is distributed through the colony during antennal contact between workers. Workers that had just left the court of a mated or virgin queen had an increased tendency to make reciprocated antennal contacts with other workers. This tendency was reinforced when the workers concerned licked the queen in addition to palpating her with their antennae, probably because they spent longer in the court. The first workers contacted by those leaving the court also had an increased tendency to make reciprocated antennal contacts. Antennal contacts were more likely to be initiated by bees other than those from the queen's court. Workers from the court and those they first contacted, participated in food transfer more than did workers selected at random. Workers that licked a virgin queen subsequently participated in food transfer more than those that palpated her with their antennae only. Within about 5 min of leaving the court, a worker's participation in reciprocated antennal contacts and in food transfer diminished to the level of non‐court workers. Workers chosen at random made more transient and non‐reciprocated antennal contacts when in a colony with a mated queen than when in a colony with a virgin queen. Copyright © 1980, Wiley Blackwell.

Environmental and social costs of pesticides: A preliminary assessment	A study was made of the indirect costs that result from pesticide usage in the United States. These costs included: 45,000 annual non-fatal and fatal human pesticide poisonings; $12 million in livestock losses; $287 million in reduced natural enemies and pesticide resistance; $135 million in honey bee poisonings and reduced pollination; $70 million in losses of crops and trees; $11 million in fish and wildlife losses; and $140 million in miscellaneous losses. The estimated total of $839 million annual losses attributed to environmental and social costs of pesticide use represents only a small portion of the actual costs. A more complete accounting of the indirect costs would probably be several times the total reported. The results of this preliminary assessment underscore the serious nature of the environmental and social costs of pesticide use.		pesticide, cost, economic aspect, geographic distribution, United States, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, losses, pesticide use, poisonings, United States	1980-01-01
Electrophoretic purification of soluble trehalase from Drosophila melanogaster by selective unstacking	Specific activity of soluble trehalase from Drosophila melanogaster has been increased at least 10 times by preparative electrophoresis using selective unstacking. However, enzyme yield was poor, with only 17% of the original activity recovered. A comparison of Km of crude and partially purified trehalase revealed no difference (0.650 and 0.666 mm, respectively).

A review of safety tests on baculoviruses	In the late 1960's the degree of safety testing required of new candidate pesticides reached a climax. During this period, the nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) of Heliothis zea (Boddie) underwent a series of tests as thorough as those required for chemicals by the Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.) in the U.S.A. and by guidelines recommended by W.H.O. These included long term carcinogenicity and teratogenicity tests, tests on primates and tests on man. Indeed, the tests were far more demanding than the tests for chemicals because they examined the possibility of infection of test animals by the insect viruses. They led to the registration of a pioneer viral insecticide containing this NPV produced in caterpillars. Two other products from Lepidoptera, containing NPVs of Orgyia pseudotsugata (McDunn) and Lymantria dispar L. have satisfied the E.P.A. registration requirements. The NPV of Neodiprion sertifer (Geoffr.) (Hym.) has proved harmless in extensive tests, including long term tests. Another 3 NPVs, those of Autographa californica (Speyer)Spodoptera littoralisBoisd. and S. exempta (Walk.) passed tests not including the long term tests. Also a non-occluded baculovirus of a coleopteran, Oryctes rhinoceros L., has passed extensive pathogenicity tests and tests in cell lines. A number of other NPVs have been partially tested and limited tests have been made on 2 granulosis viruses (GV). The NPVs proved harmless to-and unable to replicate in-microorganisms, non-insect invertebrate cell lines vertebrate cell lines, vertebrates, plants and non-arthropod invertebrates. Replication was unusual in insects outside the insect family in which the virus was first found. GVs occur only in Lepidoptera, most are believed to be very specific and none have replicated in cell lines from insects or other animals. In addition, the rapidly expanding discipline of Invertebrate Pathology has failed to find incidence of NPVs and GVs infecting hosts outside the above stated host ranges. This is in reality a vast body of evidence matched only in extent by the absence of incidence of NPVs and GVs from the publications of medical, veterinary and phytopathology science. This evidence, and the accrued data from specific safety testing, gives increasing confidence that individual NPVs and GVs of Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera are very specific. This confidence suggests that new NPVs and GVs in these orders need be subjected only to a reduced range of the more challenging tests and to tests designed to reveal harm originating from the insect species used for virus production and from contaminants. © 1980 Le François.			1980-01-01
Biometric study of the corpora allata in scaptotrigona postica during post-embryonic development	Evidence from several papers indicates that corpora allata are important in insect development, at least during metamorphosis and the reproductive stage. In light of the morphological and functional variation among sexes and castes, a comparative study has been made on Scaptotrigona postica.At the beginning of metamorphosis the corpora allata of the queen were larger than those of the worker and male; this confirms the existence of a real dichotomy in the female caste. The corpora allata of the queen showed three cycles of activity, but those of the worker and male only one. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Sequence Organisation in Nuclear DNA from Physarum polycephalum Interspersion of Repetitive and Single‐Copy Sequences	Nuclear DNA from Physarum polycephalum is shown to contain three sequence components by reassociation kinetic analysis; a foldback component consisting of 6% of the DNA, a component with the properties of repetitive sequences comprising 31% of the DNA, and a majority component containing 63% of the DNA which reassociates with the kinetics characteristic of single‐copy sequences. The complement of repetitive sequences is comprised of about 80 families of repeated elements, each containing approximately 1800 repeats per family. On average, these sequences are 6.4% richer in guanine and cytosine than total Physarum nuclear DNA. The repetitive sequences within a single family appear not to be identical, since on denaturation and annealing they give rise to collections of heteroduplexes less stable than native DNA. It is calculated that these duplexes are about 10% mismatched on average. Hydroxyapatite binding of DNA fragments of different sizes containing reassociated repeated elements demonstrates that these sequences are interspersed with single‐copy sequences in a large portion of the Physarum genome. These observations are confirmed by direct examination of reassociated DNA using the electron microscope. In this manner it is shown that repetitive sequence elements possess a wide spectrum of lengths averaging 590 nucleotide residues, and they are separated by intervening segments of DNA about 930 residues in length.

Purification and properties of a-glucosidases of the honey bee apis mellifera l.	Two kinds of a-glucosidase (I and II) were isolated from honey bees by salting-out chromatography with ammonium sulfate. α -Glucosidase 1 was purified by chromatography on CMcellulose and gel filtration on Sephadex G-I00. α -Glucosidase II was purified by chromatographies on DEAE- and CM-cellulose and by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-I50. Both enzyme preparations were homogeneous in tests by disc electrophoresis. The molecular weight of —-glucosidases I and II was estimated to be approximately 9.8 x 104 and 7.6 x 104 respectively, by SDS disc electrophoresis. α-Glucosidases 1 and II were glycoproteins whose carbohydrate moieties were about 25% and 15%, respectively. Their pH optima were 5.0. Both a-glucosidases readily hydrolyzed phenyl- α -glucoside, sucrose and maltose. —-Glucosidase 1 showed no activity toward isomaltose and soluble starch, but —-glucosidase II showed relatively high activity toward isomaltose and slight activity toward soluble starch. © 1980, by the Agricultural Chemical Society of Japan.			1980-01-01

Sterol utilization in honey bees fed a synthetic diet: Effects on brood rearing	The dietary sterols, cholesterol, campesterol, sitosterol, stigmasterol and 24-methylenecholesterol, were tested for their ability to support brood rearing in the honey bee, Apis mellifera L., by adding them singly to a chemically-defined worker bee diet. Diet supplemented with 24-methylenecholesterol supported the greatest survival of worker bees, but diet supplemented with either 24-methylenecholesterol or cholesterol supported the production of nearly equivalent amounts of sealed brood and more than any of the other three sterols tested. Diets containing stigmasterol, sitosterol, campesterol, or no supplement produced less sealed brood, in decreasing order. © 1980.			1980-01-01

Localization of short‐term memory in the brain of the bee, Apis mellifera	ABSTRACT. Fixed honey‐bees were conditioned to a scent in a one‐trial learning paradigm. In contrast to free‐flying colour‐conditioned bees, fixed scent‐conditioned bees do not show a biphasic time dependence of the conditioned response. Small metal probes were used to cool localized areas of the antennal lobes, alpha‐lobes, and calyces of the mushroom bodies of the brain at various times after conditioning. Localized cooling impaired the formation of memory in all three structures. The susceptibility to impairment after conditioning lasted approximately 3 min in the antennal lobes, 7 min in the alpha‐lobes, and 10 min in the calyx area. It was possible to determine the influence of the contralateral hemisphere (relative to the learning antenna) by conditioning bees with only one antenna. No contralateral impairment was found in the antennal lobes; there were minor effects in the alphalobes; contralateral cooling led to reductions of the conditioned response only in the calyx area. The temperature dependence of memory impairment was different for the antennal lobes and the mushroom bodies (alpha‐lobes and calyces). The latter were most sensitive to cooling at 5°C. No correlation between cooling duration and impairment of memory was found in the antennal lobes, but there was a linear relation between impairment and cooling duration in the alpha‐lobes. Brief cooling (5 or 10 s) resulted in significant impairment of memory formation only in the calyx area. A series of control experiments proved that the impairment of memory is due to a reversible block of neural activity. It was possible to show that the impairment is specific for the three neural structures analysed, by cooling the lobula of the optic system at various times after conditioning. Lesions of the brain or application of KCl also resulted in time‐dependent reductions of the conditioned response. Cooling the entire animal at various times after conditioning led to similar memory impairment to that resulting from localized cooling of the alphalobes. Copyright © 1980, Wiley Blackwell.

Flight patterns of foraging bees relative to density of artificial flowers and distribution of nectar	Flight patterns of honeybees (Apis mellifera ligustica) were quantified as the bees foraged among artificial 'flowers' for sugar solution ('nectar'). Bees exhibited considerable directionality on successive flights which minimized repeat visits to flowers and they usually made short flights to nearby flowers, thus minimizing flight time. The change in direction on successive flights between flowers were independent of the number of immediately preceding consecutive rewarding visits but decreased as the number of non-rewarding visits increased. Flight distances were short after visits to rewarding flowers but increased as the number of immediately preceding non-rewarding visits increased. The bees' rate of caloric intake (calories/time) was highest at the floral arrays having the highest density, and it was greater at arrays with clumped nectar-distributions than at those with randomly distributed nectar. These findings are explained in terms of the observed flight patterns. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.			1980-01-01
The development of juvenile hormone sensitivity in alatae of the aphid Megoura viciae	The juvenilizing effects of JH and JH mimics applied topically during pre- and postnatal development have been examined in alatiform larvae of the aphid Megoura viciae. Dose-response curves for the mimic hydroprene (ZR-512) indicate that sensitivity is greatest in the 3rd instar, rising progressively from the prenatal (embryonic) period through instars 1-2 and again declining precipitiously at the beginning of the final (4th) larval instar. This response pattern may be associated with the dual role of JH which probably controls both the metamorphosis of the mother and her parthenogenetic mode of reproduction under long day conditions. In the 3rd instar assay, the relative dose-effectiveness of JH I, II and III was 1 : 25 : 100. A 50% response was elicited by about 0.2 ng of JH I. Characters used in the scoring system (wings, pterothorax, abdominal sclerites) were all highly JH-labile, whereas other adult characters such as ocelli, the genital duct system and particularly the antennal placoid sensilla, were much less easily suppressed. Differences in organ susceptibility and the delayed effects of JH are tentatively attributed to differences in the frequency of tissue binding sites and to their prolonged occupancy by exogenous JH. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Sequence organisation in barley and oats chromosomes revealed by interspecies dna/dna hybridisation	The organisation of the repeated and non-repeated sequences in barley and oats genomes has been investigated using the repeated sequences of the wheat, oats, barley and rye genomes as DNA probes. Labelled barley and oats fragments of different lengths (200 to > 7000 nucleotides were hybridised to the repeated sequence probes and the proportions of the labelled fragments re- naturing with the probe DNAs were determined. The average spacings of these sequences through the barley and oats genomes were inferred from the results together with the proportions of the genomes in which the renatured sequences are concentrated. Over 70 per cent of barley and oats DNAs belong to families of repeated sequences. The few copy or non-repeated sequences in these genomes have a mean length of around 700 nucleotide pairs and are interspersed between repeated sequences. These findings have enabled schematic maps of the barley and oats genomes to be drawn. Both genomes appear to be constructed mostly of short sequences with neighbouring sequences being distinguished by their repetition frequency (repeated or nonrepeated) or their homology with different repeated sequence probes. Short non-repeated sequences interspersed with short repeated sequences are concentrated in regions occupying 50 to 60 per cent of the barley genome and 40 to 50 per cent of the oats genome. Most of the remaining DNA consists of tandemly arranged repeated sequences of different evolutionary origins. It is postulated that much of this complex repeated sequence DNA could have arisen from amplification of compound sequences each containing repeated and non-repeated sequences. © 1980 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.			1980-01-01
Activity of soluble and membrane-bound threhalase in apterous and alate morphs of Aphis citricola	1. 1. The optimum conditions for trehalase activity of either soluble or membrane-bound trehalase of both apterous and alate morphs of Aphis citricola were determined. 2. 2. Sodium deoxycholate (DOC) act as a solubilizing agent for membrane-bound trehalase, with no appreciable effect on its activity. 3. 3. Alates exhibit about a 50% higher level of soluble protein compared with that of apterase. Trehalase activity of this fraction in alates is 70-85% higher than that in apterase, as determined per mg protein or per aphid. The activity of the membrane-bound trehalase was on the same level in both morphs when determined relative to mg protein. 4. 4. The relative high activity of the soluble trehalase in alates may reflect an increased energy supply needed for sustaining physical activity involved in aphid flight. © 1980.			1980-01-01

Diagnosis and treatment of anaphylactic reactions to Hymenoptera stings in children	Forty-four children (mean age 9.6 years) with a history of an allergic reaction(s) to an insect sting and with positive insect venom skin tests were studied. IgE antibodies (RAST) to honeybee phospholipase A and to yellow jacket venom were found in the sera of 78% and 77%, respectively, of these patients. The patients were immunized with the appropriate venoms over a 15-week course and most were then subjected to an in-hospital sting; there was a 3% reaction rate (1/37). Clinical protection was associated with a fivefold increase in anti-venom IgG. Five patients did not develop a significant increase in IgG antibody and they were treated more vigorously; four were stung subsequently without reaction. Two patients dit not react when stung in the field; positive identification of the culprit insect was obtained. Twenty patients were re-stung after one year of maintenance therapy; there was a single mild, delayed reaction. Immunotherapy also increased the IgE antibody against venom 3.7-fold at three months; after one year of therapy the IgE antibody level had decreased but was still 40% greater than at the outset. Immunotherapy was associated with a 25% incidence of local pain and swelling and a 6% incidence of systemic reactions. We conclude that venom therapy in children is safe and effective. The indications for initiating immunotherapy require further definition. © 1980 The C. V.

Specificity of sugar cane trehalase	An extract containing trehalase and invertase was prepared from apical internodes of sugar cane. The extract hydrolysed three glucosides: maltose, trehalose and sucrose. By reprecipitation with ammonium sulphate, maltase and trehalase activities appear to be due to different enzymes. As was also shown by differential inhibition and activation and by studies on the behaviour of both enzymes during growth, invertase and trehalase activities are attributed to different enzymes whose activities do not overlap. Invertase-free preparations confirm these results. Sucrose is a simple competitive inhibitor of sugar cane trehalase, excluding a regulatory role for this sugar. Sucrose was found at inhibitory levels in the first four apical internodes. A close correlation between sugar cane growth and invertase and trehalase levels was found in the apical internodes. Invertase has the greatest activity during growing, and trehalase reaches a maximum at maturity, prior to the flowering process. The high levels of trehalase in the flower suggest that the enzyme is involved in flowering or in related processes linked to seed formation. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Evolution of haplodiploidy: Models for inbred and outbred systems	Several new models are proposed for the evolution of haplodiploidy. Each of these models is evaluated for its ability to explain (1) special problems associated with transition to haplodiploidy from a population of diplodiploid progenitors, (2) current patterns of population structure in haplodiploid and related species, and (3) the evolution of genetic systems similar but not identical to haplodiploid systems. Of the new models, three are based on special conditions associated with inbreeding. Close inbreeding provides for the automatic effects of reduced problems in expressing recessives, lowered differences in gain from heterozygosity (to produce both heterotic effects and a greater variety of offspring) between haploid and diploid males, effective protection of haploids from direct competition with diploids, and a mechanism for the spread of haplodiploidy through gains derived from increased ability to control sex ratio. These models differ in the context where gain from sex ratio control is expressed. Pathways for the evolution of haplodiploidy in outbreeding populations are also discussed. Females who parthenogenetically produce haploid males have high genetic relatedness to their sons. If the sperm of these males is used to make both sons and daughters, i.e., through matings with diplodiploid females, there may be a net gain for haplodiploids. Another outbreeding model, modified from S. W. Brown (1964, Genetics 49, 797-817), deals with selection for females producing haploid males in populations where there are driving sex chromosomes. Biases created by drive in sex ratio may allow haplodiploid females to be the only effective producers of males in the population. Several of the new models explain the whole range of haplodiploid and related adaptations and provide predictions that appear to be more consistent with the known structure of contemporary populations than those available in current models. © 1980.		animal, article, biological model, breeding, diploidy, evolution, female, haploidy, male, parthenogenesis, sex ratio, Animal, Breeding, Diploidy, Evolution, Female, Haploidy, Male, Models, Genetic, Parthenogenesis, Sex Ratio, Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.	1980-01-01
Biosynthesis of wax in the honeybee, Apis mellifera L.	The composition of the cuticular wax of the honeybee is quantitatively different from that of the comb wax. The major component of the cuticular lipids is hydrocarbon, which comprises 58% of this wax. In contrast, hydrocarbon comprises only 13-17% of the comb wax, and monoester is the largest component (Tulloch 1971). The major fractions of the cuticular wax were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography, and were shown to be qualitatively similar to those of the comb wax. The incorporation of injected radio-labelled acetate into hexane extractable wax by worker honeybees not actively producing comb wax resulted in the recovery of much of the radioactivity in the hydrocarbon fraction. In insects actively producing comb wax, a higher percentage of radioactivity was recovered in the monoester fraction. A dramatic effect of age on the distribution of radioactivity from acetate into the various wax fractions from honeybees studied in the summer months was observed. In insects from eleven to eighteen days following emergence to adults, the major wax component synthesized was monoester, whereas in younger and older insects, hydrocarbon was the major wax component formed. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments using insects actively producing comb wax showed that the abdomen produced significant amounts of monoester, hydrocarbon, and other esters, whereas the thorax synthesized mostly hydrocarbon. These data show that the epidermal cells and wax glands each produce a wax with a distinct composition, and that the age and seasonal differences observed in wax synthesis are due to the presence or absence of active wax glands. © 1980.			1980-01-01
An electron microscopic study of spermatogenesis in the drone of scaptotrigona postica (hymenoptera, apidae)	Gonocyst growth in the drone of S. postica is characterized by a series of 5 synchronous mitoses in which cytokinesis is incomplete, and the original cells remain interconnected until spermatozoa formation.During meiosis the division of spermatocytes I was terminated with an anomalous metaphase plate formation at the end of prophase (I). A concentric endoplasmic reticulum encircled the metaphase chromosomes; though microtubuleswere present, spindles were not formed. This abortive division also affected the particular behavior of the centrioles. Although the centrioles proliferated during prophase I, they did not give rise to a spindle, but became associated with the formation of centriolar blebs at cell surface, and seemed eventually to be eliminated.In S. postica, the chromosome number is maintained due to the abortiveness of the first meiotic division; therefore, chromosome distribution is normal during the subsequent division. The second meiotic division resulted in the formation of two spermatids, one of which has a greatly reduced amount of cytoplasm. Nevertheless, bothspermatids formed what look like normal sperm cells. Thus, the Scaptotrigona drone produces 2 rather than 4 sperm cells from each spermatocyte. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.			1980-01-01
EFFECT OF INTRACELLULAR INJECTION OF EGTA AND TETRAETHYLAMMONIUM CHLORIDE ON THE RECEPTOR POTENTIAL OF LOCUST PHOTORECEPTORS	Abstract— The depolarizing photoreceptor potential of locust, Valanga irregularis, as that of other arthropods, has an initial transient phase that declines to a stable sustained phase. In this work, the effect of intracellular injection of EGTA and TEA on these phases was studied. (1) Reversal potential of the transient phase was higher than that of the sustained phase. (2) EGTA and TEA enhanced both phases and the enhancement was more prominent in the sustained phase. (3) Resting potential was shifted slightly upward by the injection. The amplitude of the maximum response was also increased. (4) Current injected through an electrode filled with 2 M KCl had a significant effect on the shape of the response depending on the direction of the current. (5) It is suggested that the activation of K+ conductance induced by an increase of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration causes a decrease in amplitude of the sustained phase.

The effect of pretraining procedures and discriminative stimuli on the development of food selection behaviors in the toad (Bufo terrestris)	The present research explored the ability of the toad (Bufo terrestris) to discriminate between palatable and unpalatable prey objects based on prey color (Experiment 1) and background color (Experiment 2). The first experiment investigated the effects of prior experience with a prey object on the subsequent discrimination task. The results indicated that prior positive experience with the palatable prey object facilitated the early development of the discrimination. The second experiment showed that the toad could discriminate between identical prey objects on the basis of background color. © 1980 Academic Press, Inc.		animal experiment, central nervous system, feeding behavior, Animal, Association Learning, Bufonidae, Color Perception, Discrimination Learning, Food Preferences, Reinforcement (Psychology), Taste	1980-01-01
The control of nest depth in a digger wasp (Sphex ichneumoneus L.)	Golden digger wasps, Sphex ichneumoneus L. (Sphecidae), are a solitary, ground-nesting species that dig burrows to particular depths in the soil. I develop and evaluate alternative hypeses about the mechanisms controlling digging behaviour. By altering the wasps' burrows as thare digging, I show that they are not digging for some prescribed length of time nor are they diggingtil they reach some suitable environmental characteristic deep in the soil. Rather, they appear be digging until they reach a particular tunnel length, making corrections if the tunnel is too shallor too deep. This distance can be altered somewhat by surface environmental conditions. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Alcoholic bouin fixation of insect nervous systems for bodian silver staining. II. Modified solutions	A previously devised synthetic equivalent of 'aged' alcoholic Bouin (Duboscq-Brasil) fixative was modified in various ways to discover which of the chemical changes brought about by aging were important in improving fixation and staining. Effects were tested with ventral nerve cord ganglia of the cockroach Periplaneta americana, locust Schistocerca gregaria, and honey bee Apis mellifera. Formation of reaction products, chiefly ethyl acetate and diethoxymethane, seemed to play only a subsidiary role: neither individually appeared essential as long as a sufficient quantity of one or the other was present. In place of diethoxymethane, ethyl acetate concentration could be increased to 25% with little effect on results. Reduction in concentration of two of the original constituents, formaldehyde and ethanol, appeared to be the principal factor in improving fixation. Varying the concentration of each original constituent individually revealed that formaldehyde mainly increased glial staining, ethanol increased tissue shrinkage and reduced overall staining intensity, acetic acid improved preservation, and picric acid decreased glial staining but produced few other effects within a wide range of concentrations, though its omission seriously impaired overall preservation and staining. Varying the ethanol and acetic acid concentrations simultaneously confirmed that they acted in opposite ways. A decrease in ethanol and an increase in acetic acid both improved results. The optimum mixture, 'improved synthetic alcoholic Bouin' (40% formaldehyde 0-15: ethanol 25: acetic acid 5: ethyl acetate 5: diethoxymethane 15: picric acid 0.5: water to 100), gives better preservation and more intense staining, and formaldehyde content can be varied to give the degree of glial staining required. Without formaldehyde glial staining is virtually eliminated, while preservation and staining of the neurons appears unaffected. This modification seems to offer a valuable advance in technique. © 1980 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.		arthropod, fixation, histology, methodology, nervous system, nervous tissue, silver impregnation	1980-01-01
Observations on insect pollinators of Lycopersicon peruvianum and L. esculentum in relation to the production of F<inf>1</inf>hybrid tomato seed	Bombus griseocollis (DeGreer) was found to be the most common visitor to flowers of Lycopersicon peruvianum at Fort Collins (Larimer County) Colorado. Five other species of Bombus were less frequently observed on the flowers along with an occasional Apis mellifera L. No pollinating insects were observed visiting blossoms of L. esculentum during the entire flowering period. An efficient system to attract insect pollinators is apparently present in L. peruvianum but not in L. esculentum. We suggest that this system be transferred to L. esculentum genetically to make possible the production of inexpensive F1 hybrid tomato seed. A strategy for accomplishing this transfer is presented. Beobachtungen über Insekten als Bestäuber bei Lycopersicon peruvianum und L. esculentum in Beziehung zur Produktion von F1‐Hybridentomatensamen Die Hummel, Bombus griseocollis (DeGreer) erwies sich als haufigste Besucherin der Blüten von L. peruvianum im Gebiet von Fort Collins (Larimer County) in Colorado. 5 andere Bombus‐Arten zeigten geringere Frequenz, ebenso die Honigbiene, Apis mellifera L. Dagegen wurden während der ganzen Blütezeit bei L. esculentum keine bestaubenden Insekten in den Blüten beobachtet. Augenscheinlich ist nur bei L. peruvianum, nicht aber bei L. esculentum ein wirksames Anlocksystem fur Bestauber entwickelt. Es wird angenommen, daß dieses System von L. esculentum genetisch übertragen wird, um die Produktion von F1‐Habridentomatensamen zu ermöglichen.

Immunological comparison of phospholipases A<inf>2</inf>present in rattlesnake (genus Crotalus) venoms	The immunological properties of phospholipase A2 present in venoms from seven species of rattlesnakes (genus Crotalus) from different geographical distributions have been compared. Rabbit antiserum to purified PLA2 of Crotalus scutulatus salvini venom was used, employing inhibition of enzymic activity and immunodiffusion techniques. The amount of antiserum required for 50% inhibition of the PLA2 activity in the venoms varied from slightly more than that required for inhibition of the activity in the homologous venom to a large amount (effectively zero inhibition). A particularly close relationship in the antigenic makeup was observed between the phospholipases of C. s. salvini and C. atrox venoms as evidenced by inhibition of enzymic activity and immunodiffusion studies. No immunological cross reactivity was observed between the enzymes of the subspecies C. s. salvini and C. s. scutulatus. The results suggest extensive variations in the antigenic structure of the phospholipase molecules. The findings may also have some taxonomic significance. © 1980.		antigen, phospholipase a, snake venom, animal experiment, immunodiffusion, preliminary communication, reptile, Animal, Comparative Study, Crotalid Venoms, Immunodiffusion, Molecular Conformation, Phospholipases, Phospholipases A, Rabbits, Species Specificity	1980-01-01
Metabolism of tyramine in the central nervous system of the moth Manduca sexta	Three distinct metabolites of tyramine are produced by central nervous tissue of pharate-adult Manduca sexta incubated in vitro with [3H]-tyramine. The chemical identities of these metabolites have been sought by a combination of electrophoretic, chromatographic, hydrolytic and enzymic procedures.

Fluorimetric method for the determination of juvenoid esterase activity in insects	Esters of JH-III and of other juvenoid acids with 4-methylumbelliferone are hydrolysed by carboxylesterase enzymes present in the haemolymph and tissues of insects. The rate of their hydrolysis can be easily monitored due to the intensive fluorescence of free 4-methylumbelliferone. The fluorimetric method described makes possible routine determinations of picomole amounts of the hydrolysed juvenoid ester. Carboxylesterase enzymes that hydrolyse 4-methylumbelliferyl esters of JH-III have a Km of 0.93 × 10-6 M. These and other such juvenoid esterases have pH optima between 7.5 and 8.0. They occur in the haemolymph of various insect species and are extremely sensitive to inhibition by diisopropylphosphorofluoridate. In contrast, the monoacyl lipase enzymes that hydrolyse 4-methylumbelliferyl oleate are virtually insensitive to the inhibitor. It is concluded that the minimum, hormonally effective, in vivo concentration of many juvenoid esters occurs far below the Km values of the hydrolytic enzymes thus protecting them from metabolic inactivation. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Application of methoxymercuration-demercuration followed by mass spectrometry as a convenient microanalytical technique for double-bond location in insect-derived alkenes	The positions of double bonds in olefins can be readily determined by a sodium borohydride reduction of their methoxymercuration products followed by mass spectrometry. Fragmentation of the methoxy derivative in the mass spectrometer results in cleavage on either side of the methoxy group to give intense fragment ions which are characteristic of each isomer. This simple and convenient microanalytical technique was applied to several synthetic standards and insect derived olefins, including the alkenes from the cuticular lipids of the honeybee Apis mellifera L. © 1980 Plenum Publishing Corporation.			1980-01-01

Immunological methods based on antigen-coupled bacteriophages	Simple chemicals, many proteins, nucleic acids or polysaccharides can be coupled to bacteriophages without completely destroying their infectivity. The coupled phages are then sensitive to inactivation by the relevant antibodies. Thus it is possible to construct phage inactivation assays for antibodies or inactivation inhibition assays for antigens. The advantages of the bacteriophage methods include superior sensitivity and good stability of the reagents. The phage inactivation method defects preferably high-affinity antibodies, but what really matters is a high avidity. Because of the polyvalency IgM antibodies can have a high avidity associated with moderate affinity, and therefore low amounts of IgM class antibody, for instance natural antibody, are often measurable by this test. The chemical conjugation inactivates a proportion of the bacteriophages. If the antigen can be made chemically reactive (self-coupling), approximately 10% of the phage particles escape this inactivation and can serve as indicators of antibody action. When the antigen cannot be made chemically reactive, this inactivation is more complete and the phage assay is less satisfactory. © 1980.		immunoglobulin m, antibody detection, bacteriophage, methodology, virus inhibition, Animal, Antibody Affinity, Antibody Specificity, Bacteriophage phi X 174, Bacteriophages, Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic, Human, Immunologic Techniques, Neutralization Tests, Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, T-Lymphocytes, T-Phages	1980-01-01

Some Properties of Acetylcholinesterases Partially Purified from Susceptible and Resistant Green Rice Leafhoppers, Nephotettix Cincticeps Uhler (Hemiptera: Deltocephalidae)	Properties of acetylcholinesterases (AChE) in the green rice leafhopper were examined using partially purified normal and modified AChEs. The modified enzyme was much less sensitive to inhibition by propoxur and malaoxon than the normal one, but highly sensitive to inhibition by diazoxon. Substrate specificity and effect of pH on activity of the normal enzyme were similar to those of the bovine erythrocyte AChE used as a reference enzyme, but those of the modified AChE were obviously different from those of the other enzymes. On the other hand, difference of the normal and modified AChEs in the Km values of substrates was rather small, i.e., by a factor of less than 2. It may be concluded that the modified AChE alters in a binding site, which is related to the reaction with inhibitors, but different from the site for the intrinsic substrate acetylcholine. © 1980, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

Studies on a peptide with red pigment-concentrating and hyperglycemic activity from the cephalic endocrine system of the honeybee, Apis mellifera	Shrimp red pigment-concentrations hormone (RPCH), locust adipokinetic hormone (AKH), and locust Compound I all elevate hemolymph lipid in locusts and concentrate pigment in shrimp erythrophores. In addition, RPCH and AKH both elevate hemolymph carbohydrate in cockroaches. Material with comparable biological activity has been reported in many insects, but not in representatives of the order Hymenoptera. Distilled water head extracts of the honeybe, Apis, exhibited red pigment-concentrating activity in the shrimp Leander and hyperglycemic activity in the cockroach Periplaneta. Chemical characterization of the active substance in Apis extracts showed that like RPCH, AKH, and Compound II, it was heat stable, soluble in butanol and methanol, degraded by proteolytic enzymes, and localized in the cephalic neuroendocrine system. Similarly, like RPCH and Compound II, but unlike AKH, the Apis substance eluted at 1.2 Vt during Sephadex G-25 gel filtration. The data thus provide the initial demonstration that the endocrine system of at least one hymenopteran contains a peptide that is chemically and biologically comparable to the RPCH/AKH/Compound II group of hormonally active peptides. Furthermore, the results support the hypothesis that such peptides may be commonly used as hormones in holometabolic insects. In addition, pure Compound II was shonw for the first time to be hyperglycemic in the cockroach. © 1980.		carbohydrate, lipid, red pigment concentrating hormone, animal experiment, arthropod, drug analysis, endocrine system, hemolymph, Animal, Bees, Biological Assay, Blood Glucose, Cockroaches, Decapoda (Crustacea), Grasshoppers, Head, Hemolymph, Invertebrate Hormones, Male, Oligopeptides, Pigmentation, Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.	1980-01-01
Genetic Background of Sexuality in the Diploid Drone Honeybee	According to the latest version of the genie balance hypothesis, diploid drones should show super-male characters. Almost 38 thousand measurements or counts on haploid and diploid drones, and queens and workers, showed that (except the testes and structures on the wings) all characters were larger in diploid than in haploid drones. Many body parts of the haploid drone were larger than those of females, but some (such as mouthparts and abdomen parts) were smaller. Diploid drone body parts, being larger than those of the haploids, showed (in relation to the females) super-male character in half the dimensions investigated and, in the other half, inclination toward female characters ranging from intersex through caste and female to super-female characters. Of 10 body parts larger in females than in haploid drones, only one was smaller in diploid than in haploid drones, exhibiting a super-male character. The others tended toward female characters. In size, diploid drone body parts were closer to the queen than to the worker. Thus the main difference between the haploid and diploid drone was the larger size of the diploid and not a shift in one direction of sexuality; this disagrees with the genic balance hypothesis. The sexuality of diploid drone body parts depends upon their size and upon the relation to the haploid drone and to the females. However, the size of different body parts is not the result of genie balance, but of higher polyploidization of body tissues. This hypothesis enables a forecast to be made of sexuality of body parts not yet investigated. Higher polyploidization will cause larger body parts in diploid than in haploid drones. Diploid drone body parts will show super-male character if the parts are larger in the haploid drone than in females, and an inclination toward the female character if the parts are smaller in the haploid drone than in the females. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Effects of carbon dioxide and cold anaesthesia on the hoarding behaviour of the honeybee	Hoarding behaviour of groups of newly emerged adult honeybees was measured after they had been exposed to CO2 for 10 min, or exposed to CO2 for long enough to immobilize them, or exposed to cold. Both CO2 and cold affected hoarding behaviour. Bees exposed to CO2 for 10 min initially hoarded less, and later hoarded more, than controls. The hoarding rate of bees exposed to CO2 only long enough to immovilize them, or exposed to cold, was generally depressed throughout the experiment. Due to the complex changes in hoarding that follow CO2 treatment, cold is judged to be the preferred anaesthetic for use in hoarding experiments. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Studies in warning coloration and mimicry. VIII. Further evidence for a frequency-dependent model of predation.	Laboratory experiments used toads, Bufo terrestris, and treefrogs, Hyla cinerea, as predators and honeybees Apis mellifera as models. Bees from which the stinging apparatus had been removed served as mimics. Model and mimic bees were offered randomly with the models at frequencies of 10%, 30%, and 50% to the toads and 10%, 20%, and 50% to the treefrogs. The corresponding percentages of the model-mimic population eaten were 53.6%, 35.3%, and 19.8% (toads) and 29.6%, 17.4%, and 7.0% (treefrogs). The frequencies of bees eaten as a function of percent models in the prey population can be described by a mathematical model of predation. Predator memory values (n) of 8.0 (toads) and 28.7 (treefrogs) were obtained. Various factors affecting the behavior of the predator with respect to the value of n are discussed: toxicity vs distastefulness, alternate prey, and predator strategy. It is concluded that n is better viewed as a risk-taking strategy on the part of the predator than as a simple memory parameter. -Author		Apis mellifera, Bufo terrestris, honeybee, Hyla cinerea, toad, treefrog	1980-01-01
The effect of juvenile hormone on pupal pigmentation of Pieris brassicae L.	The role of juvenile hormone (JH) in the morphological colour adaptation of pupae of Pieris brassicae controlled by environmental factor was analyzed. First the effects of JH I and its analogue, Farnesyl-Methyl-Ether (FME) were tested. Secondly the JH-titres of the last instar larvae were measured under various light conditions which influence the future pigmentation of the pupae. During the sensitive period, which occurs before pupation, blue light (410 nm) produces the strongest, darkness medium, and yellow light (570 nm) the lightest pigmentation of the pupae. JH I as well as FME has an inhibiting effect on the formation of the black spots in the cuticle. However, this effect only becomes apparent (a) if the insects are kept under blue light during the sensitive period (which normally leads to a strong black pigmentation) and (b) only when these animals were treated with JH I or FME either at the beginning, or 10 hr after the beginning of the sensitive period. In the last larvae instar, JH could be found only during the sensitive period. Fourteen hours after the beginning of the sensitive period the JH concentration reaches a maximum of 30-100 pg JH per insect. The JH-titre resulting from blue light conditions is significantly different from those of the larvae kept under white or yellow light. An additional maximum of 60 pg JH per animal was found 8 hr/after the beginning of the sensitive period. Obviously, JH affects the process of pigmentation of the pupae, but the described results are not sufficient to explain thoroughly the regulation of pigmentation modified by environmental factors. The effects of further factors are discussed. © 1980.			1980-01-01

Ultrastructure des organes retrocerebraux de Lasius niger l. (Hymenoptera : Formicidae)	The ultrastructure of the retrocerebral system has been studied in hyperactive workers of the ant, Lasius niger. The paired elongated corpora cardiaca consist of 2 parts: the glandular part that lies in a dorsolateral position, and the more developed nervous part. In the neural area, 4 types of neurosecretory axons can be distinguished according to the size and density of their granules. The glandular cells contain numerous dense granules and large dense bodies whose nature is uncertain; they mingle with the axons of only one type. Each of the 2 anterior corpora allata is located near the nervous part of each corpus cardiacum; they consist of about 12 large cells whose plasma membrane shows many digitations; 2 types of axons can be seen in the dilated intercellular spaces. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Ein mathematisches Simulationsmodell zur Abschätzung der Populationsentwicklung im Bienenvolk (Apis mellifera L.) nach Befall mit der Milbe Varroa jacobsoni Oud.	Anhand eines mathematischen Simulationsmodells wird die Populationsentwicklung von Bienen und Milben beschrieben. Für die Anzahl B (t) der Arbeitsbienen und die Anzahl M (t) der Milben, die zur Zeit t in einem Bienenvolk leben, wurden Differentialgleichungen bzw. eine Integrodifferentialgleichung abgeleitet. Die numerischen Lösungen wurden durch ein FOR‐TRAN‐Programm realisiert, das durch einfache Eingabe der Parameter, gekoppelt mit einer unmittelbaren grafischen Darstellung der Ergebnisse, die Anpassung an die gegebenen biologischen Verhältnisse erlaubt. Das vorgestellte Modell ermöglicht Aussagen über die Populationsschwächung des Bienenvolkes sowie über die Auswirkung von Milbenreduzierungen. Mit dem Simulationsmodell ist der Zeitpunkt und die Stärke der Milbenabtötung so einzustellen, daß ein Gleichgewichtszustand und darüber hinaus die Gesundung des Volkes erreicht werden kann. A mathematical simulation model to estimate the population development in a bee colony (Apis mellifera L.) after infestation with the mite Varroa jacobsoni Oud The population of bees and Varroa‐mites in a beehive was studied by means of a Simulations‐Model with time‐dependent parameters: The numerical solution of two Differential‐Equations and one Integrodifferential‐Equation describing the number of bees and mites is realized by a FORTRAN‐Program. A good fit to given biological data is reached by an easy input of the Model‐Parameters along with a graphical output of the results. The model allows one to observe the influence of a reduction of mites. Un modèle mathématique de simulation pour l'estimation de développement de population dans une colonie d'abeilles (Apis mellifera L.) après une épidémie avec l'acarien Varroa jacobsoni Oud On décrit le développement de population d'abeilles et d'acariens au moyen d'un modèle mathématique de simulation. On a posé des équations différentielles et une équation intégrodifférentielle pour le nombre B (t) des ouvrières et le nombre M (t) des acariens vivant au moment t dans une colonie. Les solutions numériques furent réalisées avec un programme FORTRAN qui a permis l'adaptation aux rapports biologiques donnés par une opposition simple des paramètres jointe à une representation graphique immédiate des résultats. Le modèle présenté permet d'exprimer l'affaiblissement d'une population d'une colonie d'abeilles et la conséquence des réductions d'acariens. Le moment et l'intensité de la destruction des acariens doivent être établis de telle manière avec le modèle de simulation que l'on puisse atteindre un état d'équilibre et l'assainissement de la population qui en découle. Un modelo matemático simulador para calcular el desarrollo de la población en los enjambres (Apis mellifera L.) tras la infestación por el ácaro Varroa jacoboni Oud Con la ayuda de un modelo matemático simulador, se describe el desarrollo de la población de abejas y ácaros. Para la cantidad B (t) de abejas obreras y la contidad M (t) de ácaros, que viven durante el tiempo t en una población colmenera, se derivaron ecuaciones diferenciales resp. una ecuación integrodiferencial. Las soluciones numéricas se obtuvieron a través de un programa FORTRAN, el cual permite mediante la simple entrada de los parámetros, acoplada a la representación gráfica inmediata de los resultados, la adaptación a las circunstancias biologicas dadas. El modelo presentado facilita las respuestas sobre la debilitación de la población en una colmena así como sobre las repercusiones de las reducciones de los ácaros. Con el modelo de simulación se puede ajustar el momento e intensidad de destrucción de ácaros hasta alcanzar un estado de equilibrio y más allá el saneamiento de todo el enjambre. © 1980 Blackwell Verlag GmbH		animal, article, bee, biological model, mathematics, mite, parasitology, population growth, Animal, Bees, English Abstract, Mathematics, Mites, Models, Biological, Population Growth	1980-01-01
The effect of volume, ventilation and overheating of bee colonies on the construction of swarming queen cups and cells	1. 1. Experiments were carried out during two swarming seasons to study the effects of increased hive volume and ventilation, as well as that of colony overheating on the construction of swarming queen cups and cells, issuing of swarms and honey yields. 2. 2. Queen cups were constructed by all colonies, but their number varied from one year to another. Only one cup, out of 10 or 20, was transformed to a swarming queen cell. 3. 3. Fewer queen cups were transformed to queen cells by colonies maintained inside large-volume hives (low population density) than by congested colonies. 4. 4. Increased hive volume and ventilation exerted an inhibitory effect on the construction of swarming queen cups, cells and on issuing of swarms. 5. 5. Overheating of congested bee colonies significantly affected the early construction of swarming queen cups, cells and their swarming. 6. 6. Although, non-significant at P < 0.05, the honey yields obtained from colonies in high-volume, ventilated hives, were higher than those from control colonies. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Activity of β-Galactosidase in the Midgut of the Honeybee	The presence of β-galactosidase in the honeybee is reported here for the first time: activity was found in midgut homogenates of the adult worker. When lactose was used as the substrate, honeybee β-galactosidase at 37°C was most active at pH 4·0–5·0, when hydrolysis of lactose was completed in 60 min. The gut β-galactosidase showed a temperature optimum of 37°C, and was not stable at room temperature. The β-galactosidase had a Km constant at 24 mM. The significance of the low activity of bee β-galactosidase in relation to the natural diets of honeybees is discussed. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Bee virus Y	Bee virus Y (BVY), isolated from dead adult honey bees (Apis mallifera) collected in the field, is a commonly occurring serotype of bee virus X (BVX) in Great Britain. The viruses are very similar physically, although BVY aggregates in low salt concentrations and its single protein has a slightly lower mol. wt. than that of BVX. The viruses form separate bands when centrifuged to equilibrium in CsCl.		virus protein, arthropod, honeybee, insect virus, virus isolation, Apinae, Apis, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, Arthropoda, Insecta	1980-01-01
Development of the endoplasmic reticulam during human spermatogenesis	Human primary spermatocytes show a special development of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). During the leptotene-zygotene stages a cisterna of ER surrounds a third or half of the nucleus closely associated with the nuclear envelope and connected with it. In the following stages of the first meiotic prophase, stacks of these cisternae appear closely related to the nucleus and show connections with other cytoplasmic cisternae which are free in the cytoplasm. In the secondary spermatocytes and spermatids, the number of ER cisternae joined to the nucleus decreases; in contrast, the number of free ER cisternae increases. Another peculiar differentiation of the ER, such as the annulate lamellae (AL), appears in the late stages of the first meiotic prophase in relation with the nuclear envelope. AL are conspicuous in secondary spermatocytes and spermatids. In spermatids, AL appear either joined to the nucleus or free in the cytoplasm, in close proximity to the Golgi complex. Finally, AL and other membranes of the ER are released in the cytoplasmic droplets of the maturing spermatids. © 1980 S. Karger AG, Basel.			1980-01-01
Pollination of the rain-forest tree Syzygium tierneyanum (Myrtaceae) at Kuranda, Northern Queensland	The identity, abundance and foraging behaviour of pollinators of the self-compatible, mass-flowering Syzygium tierneyanum were investigated. Forty-five species of nectarivorous animals were recorded. Diurnal visitors included seven bird, nine butterfly. four moth (including two hawkmoth), two bee, two ant, one wasp, three blowfly, one fruit fly, two beetle and one weevil species. while nocturnal visitors included one bat and 12 moth (including three hawkmoth) species. Floral dimensions were such that only the vertebrate and larger insect species regularly contacted anthers and stigmas while foraging. Of these groups the feral honey bee (Apis mellifera) was the most common flowet visitor. Honeyeaters and hawkmoths appeared to be the most important native pollinators; they were abundant in the study area and visited numerous flowers (50-250) in quick succession (1-3 s per flower) on each foraging bout. The only major differences in foraging times observed in the pollinator array were between diurnal, diurnal and crepuscular, and nocturnal floral visitors. Spatial partitioning of the nectar resource was limited to one instance of territoriality involving a Macleay’s honeyeater (Meliphaga rnacleayana) on a densely flowering branch prior to peak blooming time, occasional aggressive chases by honeyeaters, and a division of foraging modes into rapid, erratic flights of 0.5-4 m between flowers (hawkmoths) as against nearest-flower movements (all other groups). This lack of major spatial partitioning may have been due to the mass flowering of S. tierneyanum and the resultant superabundance of nectar. The vast majority (c. 99.95%) of interflower movements observed in foraging bouts of birds (and of hawkmoths) were within the same plant. This suggests that most seeds of S. tierneyanum may be derived from self-pollination. © 1980 CSIRO. All rights resereved.			1980-01-01
Amplification of the classical complement pathway by the venom of the Mojave rattlesnake (Crotalus scutulatus scutulatus)	The lytic attack of human red blood cells by complement was enhanced by the venom of the Mojave rattlesnake (Crotalus scutulatus scutulatus). Lysis, however, of sheep red blood cells by complement was not enhanced by this venom. Western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) venom was anticomplementary. Enhanced lysis of human red blood cells by Mojave venom required that the red blood cells be sensitized with antibodies and that the complement system be intact. Heat inactivation of complement (56°C, 30 min) prevented lysis of red blood cells. Moreover, heating of the Mojave venom (66°C, 60 min) prevented enhanced lysis. Lytic enhancement was time, dose and temperature dependent. It is postulated that membrane active venom components enhance the efficiency of the complete complement cascade for red blood cell lysis to occur, because venom increased the lytic reaction rate. © 1980.		complement, snake venom, blood and hemopoietic system, complement activation, dose time effect relation, drug response, hemolysis, human cell, in vitro study, normal human, Animal, Complement Activation, Complement Pathway, Classical, Crotalid Venoms, Erythrocytes, Guinea Pigs, Heat, Hemolysis, Human, In Vitro, Sheep, Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.	1980-01-01
The process of differentiation during spermatogenesis in bees (Hymenoptera, apidae)	The structural changes during spermatogenesis were studied on developing spermatogonia in drone testes of seven species of bees including the honeybee Apis mellifera and six other stingless bees. In view of the uniqueness of the spermatogenic process in the honeybee haploid drone this study was made in order to compare the events characteristic of spermatogenesis in other bees. Based on the results obtained we conclude that usually the primary spermatocytes undergo an abortive first meiotic division and further an unequal division of the secondary -spermatocyte. This mechanism in associated to the formation of centriolar blebs. The main difference observed is concerned with the premeiotic cell division (4 in Apis and 5 ones in other bees). The poliploidy seems to have no effect on the chromosome distribution in meiotic cells even if occurs the pairing of the homologous. Very few interespecific variations during spermatid differentiation were confirmed. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.			1980-01-01
In vitro N-Acetylation of biogenic amines by tissues of the european corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis Hübner	[14C]-N-Acetyltryptamine was the major product of tryptamine metabolism using whole larval European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) (Hübner) homogenates, as well as homogenates of corn borer brain, suboesophageal ganglion, nervecord, gut, Malpighian tubule, fat body and carcass, with either [14C]-tryptamine or [14C]-acetyl CoA as the labelled substrate. Indoleacetic acid and indoleacetaldehyde, the products of tryptamine metabolism by monoamine oxidase (MAO), were barely detectable, indicating that tryptamine metabolism in both neural and non-neural larval corn borer tissues is catalyzed predominantly by an arylamine acetyltransferase (AAT) rather than MAO. The highest specific activity of AAT was found in brain homogenates, although the highest activities per insect equivalent of tissue were found in carcass and fat body homogenates. The AAT activity in brain and carcass homogenates towards eight indolealkylamines and phenylethylamines showed clear differences in substrate specificity, particularly in the preference found in carcass but not brain homogenates for β-hydroxylated phenylethylamines over unsubstituted analogues. These results suggest that neural AAT may be a different enzyme than that found in non-neural tissues. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Zum Meidenlernen ungenießbarer Beute bei Vögeln: Der Einfluß der Faktoren Umlernen, neue Alternativbeute und Ähnlichkeit der Alternativbeute	The process of learning to avoid an unpalatable insect was investigated in 35 caged starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Following a 2 × 2 × 2 design three factors were examined: relearning—an insect palatable at first is later on made unpalatable, new alternative prey, and similarity of appearance of alternative prey. The learning process was delayed by each of them, whereby the effect of the third factor was much stronger than those of the first and second ones. The effects are combined by multiplication rather than by arithmetic summation. Under difficult learning conditions some birds ceased to operate the insect feeder used. From a comparison of experimental and field conditions it is concluded that in the field birds learn to avoid unpalatable insects rather quickly. The significance of the results for Batesian mimicry is discussed. In Käfigversuchen wurde geprüft, wie Stare (Sturnus vulgaris) unter verschiedenen Bedingungen ein vergälltes Insekt meiden lernen. Dabei wurde der Einfluß folgender Faktoren auf den Lernvorgang untersucht: a) Umlernen: ein vorher unvergälltes Insekt ist im Lernversuch vergällt; b) neue Alternativbeute: das neben dem vergällten gebotene Insekt ist für den Vogel neu; c) Ähnlichkeit der Alternativbeute: das vergällte und das unvergällte Insekt des Lernversuchs sind einander ähnlich. Aus den drei Faktoren, die jeweils entweder wirksam oder nicht wirksam waren, ergaben sich durch Kombination 8 verschiedene Versuchsbedingungen (Versuchsplan drei Faktoren in zwei Stufen), die an je einer Gruppe von 4 oder 5, insgesamt an 35 Staren getestet wurden. Alle Vt erhielten dasselbe vergällte Insekt; die einzelnen Gruppen unterschieden sich nur durch die Alternativbeute im Lernversuch und/oder die vor dem Lernversuch gebotenen Insekten. War keiner der Faktoren wirksam, so lernten die Vt sehr rasch, das vergällte Insekt abzulehnen, d. h. schon nach einer Sitzung in mehr als 90% der Fälle. Demgegenüber verzögerte der Faktor Umlernen den Lernvorgang und verursachte ein etwas niedrigeres Meideniveau (6.—10. Sitzung: 83%). Der Faktor neue Alternativbeute bewirkte zwar, daß die Vt in der 1. Sitzung schon 43% der vergällten Insekten mieden, führte aber zu einem noch niedrigeren Meideniveau (72%). Die Kombination beider Faktoren hatte wohl eine weitere Verzögerung des Lernvorgangs, aber keine weitere Absenkung des Meideniveaus (73%) zur Folge. Bei dem Faktor Ähnlichkeit der Alternativbeute mieden die Vt erst spät, d. h. nach sechs Sitzungen, durchschnittlich mehr als 50% der vergällten Beute. Kam zu diesem Faktor noch Umlernen hinzu, so wurde die 50%‐Marke erst nach sieben Sitzungen überschritten. Waren die Faktoren Ähnlichkeit und neue Alternativbeute kombiniert, so hatten die Vt Schwierigkeiten mit der gestellten Aufgabe: Alle lehnten nach anfänglichem Probieren nicht nur den vergällten, sondern auch den unvergällten Insektentyp ab. Nur zwei lernten später, den unvergällten zu fressen, die übrigen drei verloren das Interesse am verwendeten Insektengeber. Noch größere Schwierigkeiten ergaben sich für die Vt, als alle drei Faktoren gleichzeitig wirksam waren: Sie mieden lange Zeit das unvergällte Insekt häufiger als das vergällte, offensichtlich weil sie aufgrund ihrer Vorerfahrung die Vergällung dem falschen Insektentyp zuordneten. Auch hier lernten nur zwei der Vt, das unvergällte Insekt zu fressen. Eine formale Auswertung der Werte für die Lerndauer ergibt, daß die Wirkungen der drei Faktoren sich nicht rein additiv verhalten, sondern daß entweder zur additiven Wirkung eine Wechselwirkung zwischen den Faktoren neue Alternativbeute und Ähnlichkeit hinzukommt oder daß sie sich multiplikativ verhalten, wobei die multiplikative Gleichung die Versuchsdaten am besten wiedergibt. Die quantitativen Aussagen werden dadurch eingeschränkt, daß Generalisation das Verhalten der Vt beeinflußte und daß einige auf schwierige Lernbedingungen nicht mit einer quantitativen Antwort (verlängerter Lerndauer), sondern qualitativ, d. h. mit der Weigerung, den Insektengeber weiter zu bedienen, reagierten. Aus dem Lernverhalten der Vt und einem Vergleich der Versuchs‐ mit Freilandbedingungen ergibt sich der Schluß, daß Vögel im Freiland ungenießbare Insekten rasch meiden lernen, da die Lernbedingungen hier meist günstig sind und da Vögel dazu neigen, sich bei evtl. doch auftretenden schwierigen Lernbedingungen an problemloser erreichbare Beute zu halten. Dies wird sicher durch das vielfältigere Beuteangebot und die räumliche Verteilung der Beutetiere im Freiland erleichtert. Die Bedeutung der Befunde für das Verständnis Batesscher Mimikry wird diskutiert. 1980 Blackwell Verlag GmbH			1980-01-01
Neuroanatomy of the visual afferents in the horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus)	The central nervous system of Limulus consists of a circumesophageal ring of fused ganglia and a paired ventral nerve cord. The anterior portion, the protocerebrum, receives sensory inputs including visual information. Three optic nerves, one each from the lateral eye, median ocellus, and ventral eye enter each side of the protocerebrum. The central connections of each optic nerve were determined by staining cut nerve trunks with cobalt chloride. The lateral optic nerve innervates the lamina, medulla, optic tract, ventral central body, and ocellar ganglion. The branching patterns of single axons, probably those of eccentric cells in the lateral eye retina, were observed. Single, large‐diameter axons in the lateral optic nerve ramify at seven loci including sites in each of the structures innervated by the lateral optic nerve as a whole. The median optic nerve innervates the ocellar ganglion, central body, optic tract, and medulla. Three types of branching patterns were observed for single, large‐diameter fibers in the median optic nerve. One type bypasses the ocellar ganglion and innervates the central body. A second type passes through the ocellar ganglion and optic tract without branching and innervates the posterior medulla. A third type innervates the ocellar ganglion, ventral central body, optic tract, and medulla. The ventral optic nerve is composed of large‐diameter axons of ventral photoreceptors. Each axon enters the ganglion cell layer of the medulla and branches over a planar area less than 150 μm in diameter. We also observed that axons from mechanoreceptors on the anterior carapace innervate the posterior neuropil of the medulla, and that about 5% of the neurons in the medullar ganglion cell layer send axons to the ipsilateral circumesophageal connective.

Fine structural aspects of the developing compound eye of the honey bee, apis mellifera L.	We studied the postembryonic development of the compound eye of the worker honey bee on the light and electron microscopy levels. During the late third and early fourth larval instars the cells of the optic primordium became organized into preommatidial cell clusters. Each cluster contained four prospective cone cells, nine prospective retinula cells (of which the ninth was centrally located and shorter than the other eight), and an undetermined number of prospective pigment cells. During ommatidial differentiation that was characterized by ommatidium and crystalline cone elongation, the ninth retinula cell moved laterally, and each retinula cell elaborated a rhabdomer. Possible roles of membrane junctional specializations and cytoplasmic microtubules in the processes of differentiation are discussed. © 1980 Academic Press, Inc.		animal experiment, arthropod, compound eye, electron microscopy, embryo, organogenesis, visual system, Animal, Bees, Cell Differentiation, Eye, Larva, Metamorphosis, Biological, Microvilli, Organoids, Photoreceptors, Pigments	1980-01-01
Occurrence of Melanosis and Other Diseases in the Queen Honeybee, and Risk of their Transmission During Instrumental Insemination	Melanosis-like symptoms occur frequently in honeybees in Denmark. Investigation revealed great variation among colonies and among apiaries. No correlation was found between thesymptoms and drone-laying or otherwise ineffective queens, or the occurrence of Nosema apis. Several yeast species were isolated from queens with melanosis-like symptoms or ineffective queens, but no isolates caused either melanosis-like symptoms or other indications of disease. Paecilomyces lilacinus caused a lethal disease when introduced into the reproduction organs of instrumentally inseminated queens, and it is probable that similar ‘spontaneous’ infective may occur during mating. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Insulin-like and glucagon-like peptides in insect hemolymph	Haemolymph from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta (L.), was examined for insulin-like, glucagon-like and gastrin-like peptides. Several immunoreactive components similar in size to vertebrate insulin and glucagon were separated by gel filtration of acid extracts of larval and pupal haemolymph. No gastrin-like peptide was detected. These results provide evidence that at least two of these peptide hormones are transported in haemolymph to target tissues in insects. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Purification and Properties of α-Glucosidases of the Honey Bee Apis mellifera L.	Two kinds of a-glucosidase (I and II) were isolated from honey bees by salting-out chromatography with ammonium sulfate. a-GIucosidase I was purified by chromatography on CM-cellulose and gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. a-Glucosidase II was purified by chromatographies on DEAE- and CM-celluIose and by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-150. Both enzyme preparations were homogeneous in tests by disc electrophoresis. The molecular weight of a-glucosidases I and II was estimated to be approximately 9.8 x 104 and 7.6 x 104, respectively, by SDS disc electrophoresis. a-Glucosidases I and II were glycoproteins whose carbohydrate moieties were about 25% and 15%, respectively. Their pH optima were 5.0. Both a-glucosidases readily hydrolyzed phenyl-a-glucoside, sucrose and maltose. a-Glucosidase I showed no activity toward isomaltose and soluble starch, but a-glucosidase II showed relatively high activity toward isomaltose and slight activity toward soluble starch. © 1980, Japan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Agrochemistry.

Acceptance by Honeybee Colonies of Larvae in Artificial Queen Cells	Some factors affecting the acceptance of grafted queen cells were studied. Acceptance was low (32%) when queen pheromone (9-oxodec-trans-2-enoic acid) was present in the wax of artificial queen cups. Statistically significant differences were found between the acceptance rate of queen cups made of: (a) beeswax from old brood combs (86·6%), (b) fresh beeswax (76·6%), (c) capping wax, beeswax foundation, or equal parts of paraffin and old beeswax (70%). Pure paraffin cells were not accepted at all. Acceptance was independent of the time of day or night when grafting was done. Acceptance of cells primed with royal jelly containing 10% bee-stored pollen was 50·9%, but 93·3% for control cells primed with pure royal jelly. Royal jelly containing 10% stored pollen caused much rejection when added to cells containing developing queen larvae. Acceptance was 86·2% for cells primed with royal jelly containing 10% honey, but only 52% with royal jelly containing 5% honey and 5% stored pollen. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Evidence and Action of Cannibalism Substance in Apis Cerana Indica	Of 26 colonies investigated, 11 were headed by Apis cerana indica queens sibling-mated to several drones. The queens produced diploid drone larvae in about 25% of worker cells. Altogether, 9734 eggs were individually recorded, and the survival rate of brood was monitored on successive days. All the results showed that diploid drone larvae of Apis cerana are not eaten by nurse bees during the first day of larval life as in Apis mellifera. In unfavourable environmental conditions some were eaten in place of worker larvae. Many diploid drone larvae were eaten in their second day of life, but some were reared even until the fourth day, and in favourable conditions some probably reach the adult stage. This suggests that A. cerana diploid drone larvae secrete much less cannibalism substance at the beginning of larval life, but later produce it for a much longer period of life, than do A. mellifera diploid drones. This is another specific difference between the two species of Apis, indicating an earlier evolutionary stage in A. cerana. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Hoarding Behaviour and Life Span of Inbred, Non-Inbred and Hybrid Honeybees	Caged groups of 50 newly emerged workers (Apis mellifera carnicd) stored the sugar solution provided (and in other experiments honey) in empty comb in their cages. On average, non-inbred workers took the food significantly faster than inbred workers, and hybrid workers took it faster than inbred workers of their parental lines. These results are discussed with respect to earlier results showing a difference in recruiting ability between inbred and non-inbred colonies. On average non-inbred workers lived longer than inbred workers, and hybrid workers longer than workers from their parental lines. Implications are discussed of inbreeding depression and heterosis, for both hoarding behaviour and length of life of workers, in relation to the theory of genetic load in haplo-diploid systems. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Sterol utilization in honey bees fed a synthetic diet: Analysis of prepupal sterols	The sterols of prepupal honey bees, Apis mellifera L., from brood reared by workers fed chemically-defined synthetic diets containing cholesterol, campesterol, sitosterol, stigmasterol, 24-methylenecholesterol, or no sterol over a 12-week period were isolated, identified, and quantified. The major sterol present in each prepupal sample was 24-methylenecholesterol, but significant levels of sitosterol and isofucosterol were also present in every case, as was a very small percentage of desmosterol (usually < 1%). This is the first report of isofucosterol being identified in the sterols of the honey bee. A considerably larger percentage of each dietary sterol was found in prepupae reared by workers fed that particular sterol in the diet. This was most dramatic in the case of the cholesterol diet in which case cholesterol content increased to as much as 17.2% of the prepupal sterols, whereas cholesterol had not exceeded 2.2% in samples from other diet regimens. However, stigmasterol comprised no more than 6.3% of the total sterols in any sample from prepupae fed the stigmasterol diet. The preponderance of 24-methylenecholesterol in all prepupae, regardless of the dietary sterol provided to the workers, as well as the lesser quantities of sitosterol and isofucosterol present in all samples, suggest a unique system of utilization and metabolism of these dietary sterols by the worker bees. Apparently they make available to the brood varying amounts of unchanged dietary sterol plus considerable and fairly constant portions of 24-methylenecholesterol, sitosterol, and isofucosterol drawn from their own sterol pools. © 1980.			1980-01-01

The effect of light on glycogen turnover in the retina of the honeybee drone	The retina of the compound eye of the drone (Apis mellifera) comprises two distinct classes of cells: the photoreceptors and the glial cells. The photoreceptors contain mitochondria and the photopigment (rhodopsin). The glial cells do not contain mitochondria, but large amounts of glycogen granules. Light stimulation causes intraglial glycogen metabolism to accelerate. Since glial cells are not directly excitable by light, it is deduced that the absorption of light by rhodopsin must somehow cause a signal to pass the glial cells to activate the glycogen metabolism.		glycogen, rhodopsin, animal experiment, arthropod, compound eye, photostimulation, retina, visual system, Animal, Bees, English Abstract, Glycogen, Male, Models, Biological, Neuroglia, Photic Stimulation, Photoreceptors, Retina, Rhodopsin	1980-01-01

Gas chromatography of carbaryl derivatives was not consistently useful because bee constituents interfered either with the formation of derivatives or with detection. Only the N-acetyl derivative was formed quantitatively in the presence of cleaned-up bee extracts, but the nitrogen-specific detector was sometimes, and the electron-capture detector always, subject to interference from bee constituents remaining after clean-up.		carbaril, arthropod, bee, liquid chromatography	1980-01-01
Ultrastructure of Invertebrate Chemo-, Thermo-, and Hygroreceptors and Its Functional Significance	Chemo-, thermo-, and hygroreceptors are primary sensory cells, which bear one or several modified cilia whose membranes are specialized to take part in the transduction process. These membranes must be exposed to the stimuli but also be protected against desiccation, mechanical, and other injury. Hence, a variety of structural specializations is found that serves these functions. In insects, chemo-, thermo-, and hygroreceptive sensory cells are located exclusively in sensilla, which are organelles built up by a definite number of characteristic cells. During development, the innermost enveloping cell produces a cuticular sheath (scolopale), which envelops the dendritic processes for varying distances along their course through the receptor lymph cavity. This sheath producing cell is surrounded by the trichogen cell, which is itself surrounded by the trichogen cell. These cells build up shaft and socket, respectively, of the cuticular outer structures during development. The perikarya of all cells of the sensillum are enclosed within the epidermis. © 1980 Academic Press Inc.		arthropod, chemoreceptor, electron microscopy, hygrometry, thermoreceptor	1980-01-01
Laboratory Measurement of Honey Production in the Honeybee I. A Model for Hoarding Behaviour by Caged Workers	The relationship was examined between honey production by 14 colonies and hoarding behaviour by workers from these colonies in laboratory cages. Hoarding of sugar syrup in the test cages (wt/bee/day) on days 5–15 after emergence seemed to be correlated with honey production. Hoarding on days 7–9 was highly correlated with colony weight gain (r = +0·684, P < 0·01), on days 5–6 and 10–15 less so, and on days 1–4 and 16-20 not at all. Analysis of variance revealed highly significant differences between source colonies for hoarding on days 7–9 (P < 0·001). These results provide the basis for a model of hoarding behaviour, in which hoarding in the cage on days 5–15, and particularly days 7–9, is related to honey production. Workers held for their first 7 days in a colony hoard syrup during the next 3 days similarly to newly emerged workers, not like workers 8–10 days old. The correlation for days 7–9 in the cages was apparently due to adjustment to life in a cage, after which amount of syrup they hoard falls into relationship with their colony’s production. This measurement of hoarding behaviour, unlike previously reported measurements, seems likely to be useful in a honeybee selection programme for increased production. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
In vivo control of haemolymph-α-glucosidase kinetics by glycemic components according to the developmental stages of worker-bees (Apis mellifica mellifica, L.)	1. 1. The main following correlations have been found between the α-glucosidase kinetics and the glycemia is determined in worker-bees-haemolymph. 2. 2. The maximum velocity (VM) is positively correlated with the trehalosemia (T) within each stage, but negatively from one stage to another. 3. 3. The affinity constant (K) is positively correlated with the glucosemia (G) within each stage, and negatively, again, over the entire development range. 4. 4. The Hill coefficient (nH) is only negatively correlated with the glucosemia within each stage. 5. 5. These enzymic mechanisms allow an auto-control of the (T)/G) ratio, as a complement to other (hormonal) ways of glycemic regulation. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Information-statistical analysis of social interaction and communication: An analysis-of-variance approach	Using informational statistics, an analysis-of-variance model is developed for separating the exclusive effects of two simultaneously present factors on the variability of the ongoing behaviour of a reference subject. In particular the following factors are considered: the preceding behaviour of the reference subject itself and the preceding behaviour of its partner. Effects due to the latter are usually regarded as representing communication. The model is compared with other information-statistical models for social interaction proposed in ethological research. Three properties are discussed: structural complexity, the rationale for identifying relevant effects and the efficiency in measuring them. With respect to measuring communication it is shown that several existing models confounded inter-individual and intra-individual effects in behaviour sequences. It is pointed out that different analytical frameworks (e.g. Markovian stochastic processes or analysis-of-variance) can use the same information-statistical formalism but give rise to different interpretations. Finally, the relation between the complexity of inter- and intra-individual effects in interaction sequences and the structure of information-statistical models is discussed. In Appendix I computational procedures are specified; in Appendix II a Monte Carlo procedure for testing observed variability measures is presented. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Anti-Rheumatic Drugs: Present Deadlock and New Vistas	This chapter discusses anti-rheumatic drugs. The broadly accepted views on anti-rheumatic drugs in present clinical use have been discussed mainly as background information. The side effects of clinically used anti-rheumatic drugs or rather, biopharmaceutical and structural modifications required to abolish side effects, have also been discussed in this chapter. It discusses several drugs that are not anti-inflammatory but do benefit rheumatoid arthritis patients, influence events that are either not involved in conventional inflammatory animal models or their possible involvement has not been sufficiently explored. Besides rheumatoid arthritis, there are two other joint conditions in which inflammation dominates: gouty arthritis induced by monosodium urate crystal deposits and pseudo-gout. The chapter discusses physiological mechanisms, as they seem to operate (as defective autoregulatory processes) during rheumatoid arthritis to cause the unpredictably fluctuating spontaneous remissions. © 1980, Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press.

Effect of Sex Allele Homo-Heterozygosity on Honeybee Colony Populations and on their Honey Production 1. Favourable Development Conditions and Unrestricted Queens	Virgin queens were each mated to two brothers, giving three groups of queens producing offspring with different combinations of sex alleles. In all, 26 500 brood cells were individually examined to determine brood survival rates; also 7720 measurements of brood areas were made in colonies, weekly in 1977 and at 3-weekly intervals in 1978. Of 32 queens, 8 produced brood of 50% survival rate, 14, of 75% and 10, of 100%. Influence of the composition of sex alleles on the brood area was apparent 3 weeks after equalization of colony populations. Similar brood areas were found in all three groups of colonies during spring and autumn, but in summer colonies with brood of 50% and 75% survival rates produced 68% and 82%, respectively, of the brood area found in normal colonies. When queens in normal colonies laid fewer than 1000 eggs daily, those producing brood of lower survival rates were able to replace non-surviving larvae by new eggs, but this was not possible with higher laying rates. Colonies with brood of 50% and 75% survival rates had (in relation to normal colonies) 79% and 89% of the worker population in spring. In summer normal colonies had 30 000 workers, and those with brood of 50% and 75% survival rates only 35% and 93% as many, respectively. In autumn the values were 65% and 91%. Colonies with brood of 50% and 75% survival rate produced 50% and 102%, respectively, of the 12 kg of surplus honey harvested from normal colonies. Interaction occurred between the progress of the season and the amount of brood, worker population and honey produced by the three groups of colonies. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Rapid Estimation of the Number of Sex Alleles in Panmictic Honeybee Populations	A simple formula, based on Kerr’s (1967), is proposed for estimating the number of sex alleles in a panmictic honeybee population. Only the mutation rate and the number of colonies need be known. Values are in agreement with those obtained by other methods, especially with a mutation rate of 10−5. The only exception is the population on Kangaroo Island, S. Australia (Woyke, 1976), which is not considered to be a panmictic unity. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Cuticular lipid biosynthesis in the scorpion, Paruroctonus mesaensis	The synthesis of cuticular and hemolymph lipids in the scorpion Paruroctonus mesaensis, was examined using radiolabeled acetate and palmitic acid. Incorporation of 1‐14C‐acetate into cuticular lipids was very low (0.03–0.13% of injected label), with the hydrocarbons exhibiting only trace (CPM's not significantly higher than background) radioactivity after 24 hours. Cuticular alcohols had the highest incorporation (ca. 80%) followed by free fatty acids and triglycerides. Hemolymph lipids also showed poor incorporation of labeled acetate (0.01%) and little activity in the hydrocarbon fraction. Incorporation of 1‐14C‐palmitic acid into cuticular lipids (0.86–1.21%) and hemolymph lipids (0.62–1.00%) was slightly higher, but still well below incorporation values observed for insects. The majority of the label appeared in the free fatty acids; hydrocarbons continued to show only trace radioactivity. Except for differences in the relative amounts of specific components, cuticular and hemolymph hydrocarbons were similar in composition. These results suggest that hydrocarbon biosynthesis in adult scorpions is very low during the intermoult period or that other compounds are preferred precursors.

Spermathecal ultrastructure of the insect Rhodnius prolixus stal	The paired spermathecae of Rhodnius are simple tubular out‐pocketings of the common oviduct. Each consists of a short muscular proximal duct and the distal glandular region with a blind tapering end. The spermathecal wall has a cuticular intima, slender columnar epithelial cells and ensheathing longitudinal striated muscle, connective tissue, tracheoles, and nerves. Glandular epithelial cells possess an elaborate apical secretion‐filled tubular inpocketing with an extensively folded plasma membrane. Laterally, cells interact by desmosomes, septate desmosomes, and extensive interdigitations. The cytoplasm is rich in longitudinally oriented microtubules associating with membrane densities along the invagination, lateral, and basal plasmalemmae. Apical concentration of mitochondria suggests their role in secretion or ion transport. The possible role of the spermathecae in maintaining the stored luminal sperm and its role in transmitting the mating stimulus is considered in light of the epithelial ultrastructure. The ultrastructure of the spermathecae of Rhodnius differs significantly from that of other insects. Copyright © 1980 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.			1980-01-01
Effect of weather factors on honeybee flight activity and colony weight gain	For three consecutive years, the flight activity from 10 honeybee colonies was recorded for a whole day at the beginning, middle and end of the flow. The outgoing flights started at about 9.00 h reach a maximum between 14.00 and 16.00 h and ceased at about 21.00 h. Multiple correlation coefficients of humidity, temperature, wind speed and light intensity with flight activity ranged from + 0.701 to + 0.978, all highly significant. Correlation coefficients of temperature with flight activity ranged from + 0.532 to + 0.947, also highly significant. There was a significant direct relationship between flight activity and colony weight gain 30 min later. This weight gain was correlated with honeybee activity and the above four weather factors (+ 0.490 to + 0.837, all highly significant). The mean daily flight activity of a colony was highly significantly correlated with the total weight gain of the colony at the end of the season (− 0.766 to + 0.879). This relationship was not significant on a day with no weight gain. Mean flight activity significantly differed between years. Overwintered colonies flew more than package colonies. A single day’s activity was related to the total seasonal weight gain of the same colonies. The results suggested that a single day–s gain is also related to the total seasonal gain, and that by weighing colonies on two consecutive mornings the highest-gaining colonies could be selected for breeding. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Further evidence of insect growth disruption by neem seed fractions	Four panially purified neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) seed fractions, NN 18–701, NN 18–705, NN 18–79a and NN 18–79b, have been tested for growth disrupting activity with two holometabolous insects, Ephestia kuehniella Zell. and Apis mellifera L. The neem fractions were applied topically to the spinning stage of last larval instar of E. kuehniella and third larval instar of A. mellifera. Fraction NN 18–79a was most effective, followed by NN 18–705, in causing metamorphic disturbances in both the insects; NN 18–79b was third in effectiveness, while NN 18–701 was almost inactive. However, fraction NN 18–705 showed higher antifeeding activity than fraction NN 18–79a. The treatment of E. kuehniella larvae with the neem fractions caused delayed larval development, and in NN 18–79a treatment, many died as larval‐pupal intermediates; pupal and adult malformations were also observed. In A. mellifera, maximum mortality occured immediately before larval‐pupal ecdysis. It seems that the insect growth disrupting activity exhibited by neem seed fractions NN 18–705 and NN 18–79a, is independent of feeding inhibition. Weiterer Nachweis einer Hemmung der Insektenentwicklung durch Fraktionen aus Neemsamen Vier angereicherte Fraktionen aus Neemsamen (Azadirachta indica A. Juss), NN 18–701, NN 18–705, NN 18–79a und NN 18–79b, wurden auf Entwicklungshemmung bei zwei holometabolen Insekten, Ephestia kuehniella Zell. und Apis mellifera L., getestet. Die Neemfraktionen wurden dem letzten Larvenstadium (Spinnlarven) von E. kuehniella und dem dritten Larvenstadium von A. mellifera topikal appliziert. Die Fraktion NN 18–79a verursachte bei beiden Insekten die stärksten Metamorphosestörungen, gefolgt von NN 18–705 und NN 18–79b, wahrend NN 18–701 kaum aktiv war. Fraktion NN 18–705 hatte aber bei Bienenlarven eine stärkere Fraßabschreckung als NN 18–79a. Mit Neemfraktionen behandelte E.‐knehniella‐Larven entwickelten sich verzögert oder überhaupt nicht weiter. Mit NN 18–79a starben viele als Larven‐Puppen‐Zwischenformen; Mißbildungen von Puppen und Adulten wurden ebenfalls beobachtet. Bei A. mellifera lag das Maximum der Mortalität unmittelbar vor der Larven‐Puppen‐Ecdysis. Die durch die Neemfraktionen NN 18–705 und NN 18–79a verursachte Entwicklungshemmung scheint nicht von ihrer fraßabschreckenden Wirkung abzuhängen. 1980 Blackwell Verlag GmbH			1980-01-01
The deutocerebrum of the cockroach Blaberus craniifer burm. Spatial organization of the sensory glomeruli	The objective of this work is to describe the glomerular organization of the deutocerebrum in Blaberus craniifer and to test the hypothesis that the glomeruli are identifiable. The problem is studied using the techniques of analytical geometry, i.e., by measuring the location of the glomeruli in cartesian coordinate systems. Computerized geometrical and statistical techniques are described for the three‐dimensional reconstruction and quantitative study of these brain structures. The invariance of the glomerular organization, and consequently the identifiability of the glomeruli, is based on three criteria: (1) the number of glomeruli per hemideutocerebrum (hDTC) is a constant (109); (2) the position of the glomeruli is symmetrical in the two sides of one individual and identical in the same side of two individuals, except for small local variations, (3) the dimensions of two positionally homologous glomeruli are statistically equal in the same and in different individuals, except for a macroglomerulus which is found only in the male. The causes of variability, from experimental and biological origin, are discussed and quantitatively evaluated. The interindividual biological variability, not ascribable to differences in size between brains, expressed as a 95% interval, is estimated to be 27 μm for the location of glomeruli and 12 μm for the diameter of glomeruli.

The effect of huddling on thermoregulation and oxygen consumption for the naked mole-rat	1. 1. Individual and huddled naked mole-rats became progressively hypothermic at lowered ambient temperatures; tb = 20.6 + 0.41 Ta. 2. 2. Oxygen consumption of individual mole-rats increased more than that of huddled mole-rats at Ta < 34°C. 3. 3. Huddling behaviour considerably reduced the mass-specific thermal conductance from 0.25 ml O2 g-1 °C-1 (individual) to 0.12 (group of four) at Ta = 20°C. 4. 4. Thus, huddled mole-rats are unlike other endotherms since they maintain the same Tb as individuals but at a reduced metabolic cost. 5. 5. Huddled mole-rats had lower rates of evaporative water loss than individuals, at high Ta because of their lower exposed surface area and VO2 (per individual). © 1980.			1980-01-01
Corpora Cardiaca‐Allata Complex of the Larvae of the Pink Bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella. An Ultrastructural Study in Relation to Diapause	Raina, A. K., Borg, T. K. 1980. Corpora cardiaca‐allata complex of the larvae of the pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella. An ultrastructural study in relation to diapause. (Department of Entomology, North Dakota State University of South Carolina, School of Medicine, Columbia, U.S.A.) — Acta zool. (Stockh.) 61(2): 65–77. The corpora cardiaca (CC) and corpora allata (CA) of the pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella, were studied at the ultrastructural level during induction maintenance, and termination of larval diapause. The CC is composed of 5–6 intrinsic secretory (IS) cells, glial cells, and axons that carry electron dense (ED) and electron lucent (EL) granules from the brain. The IS cells produce ED granules with an average diameter of 110 ± 26 nm. During diapause, the axons with ED granules showed large accumulations of neurosecretory granules, but the axons with the EL granules contained lesser amounts. The CA is made up of approximately 25 large cells and axons that pass through the CC from the brain. Most of the axons take up a peripheral position. A characteristic feature of CA cells during diapause was the presence of stacks of convoluted tubules of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) that may be associated with juvenile hormone synthesis. The IS cells of the CC appeared to be inactive during diapause. 1980 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences			1980-01-01
Genetic distance: A simple quantitative measure of biological relatedness	We propose a new quantitative method of establishing the biological relatedness of two organisms, by means of comparison of the experimentally observed, differential-melting-curves of their DNAs which are assumed to depend on the detailed structure of the corresponding base pair sequences. In the light of recent experimental and theoretical results discussed in this paper, this assumption seems to be well justified. In the case of viruses and bacteria, analysis of available experimental data, demonstrates the straightforward applicability of the method in quantitative determinations of relatedness. In spite of certain difficulties arising in the application of the method to eucaryotes, we believe that it still could serve in obtaining at least first-order estimates of eucaryotic relatedness. © 1980, All rights reserved.		genetic distance, heredity, methodology, Eukaryota	1980-01-01
A hemolytic polypeptide from the venom of the red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus	The venom of Pogonomyrmex barbatus was analyzed with a view to elucidating the chemical nature of the agent responsible for direct hemolysis. Gel filtration experiments indicated the mol. wt of the active substance, termed barbatolysin, to be ca. 3000. Barbatolysin was isolated in nearly pure form by isoelectric focusing and was found to be a strongly basic polypeptide containing 34 amino acid residues. The relative susceptibility of erythrocytes from different animals was compared using venoms of P. barbatus, P. badius and Apis mellifera. Barbatolysin was not lethal for mice, but mouse lethality was associated with a second venom component having an isoelectric pH of 8·0 and a mol. wt of 8000. The information obtained suggests that there is a functional resemblance between the venoms of P. barbatus and A. mellifera with respect to direct-acting hemolysins. © 1980.		ant venom, hemolysin, insect venom, animal experiment, barbatolysin, blood and hemopoietic system, drug analysis, drug toxicity, hemolysis, intoxication, mouse, Amino Acids, Animal, Ant Venoms, Arthropod Venoms, Cattle, Dogs, Erythrocytes, Goats, Guinea Pigs, Hemolysins, Hemolysis, Horses, Human, In Vitro, Isoelectric Focusing, Lethal Dose 50, Mice, Peptides, Rabbits, Rats, Sheep, Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.	1980-01-01
The effects of honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) venom and two of its constituents, melittin and phospholipase A<inf>2</inf>, on the cardiovascular system of the rat	The cardiovascular effects of whole lyophilised honey bee venom and its major constituents, melittin and phosphatidate 2-acylhydrolase, EC 3.1.1.4 (phospholipase A2) have been studied in the anaesthetised rat and on the isolated perfused rat heart. Single bolus injections of whole venom (5-20 μg) irreversibly paralysed the isolated heart in 30-60 sec; perfusion of lower concentrations (1-8 μg/g tissue/min) caused paralysis over longer periods. In the whole animal, bee venom produced two differing responses on blood pressure depending on resting levels. In animals with a mean blood pressure of 95/67 mmHg, venom (0·5 mg/kg body weight) caused an increase of about 20 mmHg in 30 sec; in animals with a mean blood pressure of 138/112 mmHg, venom (0·7 mg/kg body weight) caused a marked fall. In both cases blood pressure returned to pre-venom levels after 5 min. Electrocardiographic changes were noted 15-20 min after envenomation, principally T wave elevation followed by ST-segment depression. The majority of these effects can be ascribed to the main constituents of honey bee venom; melittin (20-40 μg) irreversibly paralysed the isolated heart in 37-64 sec, phospholipase A2 was inactive. In the anaesthetised animal, melittin (200 μg/kg) slightly increased blood pressure but did not invariably affect ECG, whereas phospholipase A2 was profoundly hypotensive. The cardiotoxicity of melittin was less marked in the whole animal. © 1980.		hymenoptera venom, metformin, phospholipase a, animal experiment, arthropod, blood pressure, cardiotoxicity, cardiovascular system, drug comparison, drug toxicity, electrocardiography, heart, heart rate, honeybee, in vitro study, intoxication, rat, short survey, Anesthesia, Animal, Bee Venoms, Heart, Hemodynamics, Male, Melitten, Pentobarbital, Phospholipases, Phospholipases A, Rats, Urethane	1980-01-01
The toxicity of diflubenzuron to honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies in apple orchards	The effect of diflubenzuron on honey bees in apple orchards in southeastern England was studied in 1976. In two experiments apple trees cv. Cox's Orange Pippin, in full flower and with honey bees foraging on the blossom, were sprayed with diflubenzuron at 0.11, 0.20 or 0.40 kg a.i.†/ha, HCH at 0.25 kg a.i./ha or malathion at 2.52 kg a.i./ha. Diflubenzuron did not reduce the numbers of adult or larval bees, whereas HCH or malathion killed many adult bees. In a third experiment in 1978 in eastern England diflubenzuron at 0.22 kg a.i./ha was sprayed on to bees returning to their hive. Neither adult nor larval bees were killed by this treatment. Small quantities (0.11 and 0.30 μg/g) of diflubenzuron were found in samples of honey from hives sited in plots treated with this insecticide. Copyright © 1980, Wiley Blackwell.

Amino Acids in Pollens and Nectars of Citrus Cultivars and in Stored Pollen and Honey from Honeybee Colonies in Citrus Groves	Total amino acids and crude protein levels were analysed in pollens from flowers of nine citrus cultivars, and in stored pollen from three honeybee colonies in citrus groves. Free amino acids were determined in the nectars from six cultivars and in three citrus honeys. Although the protein levels of pollens from different cultivars ranged from 6·2% to 20·7%, the percentage of individual amino acids was relatively constant. Aspartic acid and glutamic acid were the predominant amino acids in the pollen from flowers. Stored pollen contained 17·1% to 22·6% protein, and higher amounts of proline than flower pollen. Nectars contained 7·5 to 79·1 mg/100 g of amino acids. Wide variation was observed both in the numbers and in the levels of amino acids in the nectars. In nectars in which they were found, proline and serine were the predominant amino acids. In contrast, the kinds and amounts of amino acids were fairly constant in the honey samples, proline being the major one. Unlike most plants, Citrus has low levels of proline in pollen and high levels in nectar. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01

Immunochemical and electrophoretic identification of the vitellogenin proteins of the queen bee (Apis mellifera)	1. 1. Vitellogenin was localized in laying queens' and workers' ovaries and in eggs using antisera against emerging and laying queens' ovaries in double-diffusion, immunoelectrophoresis and radioimmunoelectrophoresis analyses. 2. 2. Vitellogenin was preparatively separated by polyacrylamide gradient (5-11%) gel electrophoresis as band X, and the eluate was used to prepare antiserum against vitellogenin. 3. 3. Vitellogenins were detected in the haemolymph of both laying and non-laying females of the two castes, but not in that of drones. 4. 4. Vitellogenin was separated by isoelectric focusing into 9 components with pI values between 5.9 and 7.2. 5. 5. Vitellogenin (band X) was separated into 26 components by SDS-polyacrylamide gradient (5-15%) gel electrophoresis. 6. 6. Female-specific proteins were present in the haemolymph of the two castes, but only a part of them were vitellogenins. 7. 7. Vitellogenins were found in the fat body and ovaries of laying queens, but not in those of emerging ones. 8. 8. No vitellogenin was found in royal jelly nor in the mid-gut of laying queens. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Queen pheromone transfer within honeybee colonies	ABSTRACT. The observations provided strong circumstantial evidence that workers in a queen's court obtain queen pheromone on their antennae, and that queen pheromone is distributed through the colony during antennal contact between workers. Workers that had just left the court of a mated or virgin queen had an increased tendency to make reciprocated antennal contacts with other workers. This tendency was reinforced when the workers concerned licked the queen in addition to palpating her with their antennae, probably because they spent longer in the court. The first workers contacted by those leaving the court also had an increased tendency to make reciprocated antennal contacts. Antennal contacts were more likely to be initiated by bees other than those from the queen's court. Workers from the court and those they first contacted, participated in food transfer more than did workers selected at random. Workers that licked a virgin queen subsequently participated in food transfer more than those that palpated her with their antennae only. Within about 5 min of leaving the court, a worker's participation in reciprocated antennal contacts and in food transfer diminished to the level of non‐court workers. Workers chosen at random made more transient and non‐reciprocated antennal contacts when in a colony with a mated queen than when in a colony with a virgin queen. Copyright © 1980, Wiley Blackwell.

Environmental and social costs of pesticides: A preliminary assessment	A study was made of the indirect costs that result from pesticide usage in the United States. These costs included: 45,000 annual non-fatal and fatal human pesticide poisonings; $12 million in livestock losses; $287 million in reduced natural enemies and pesticide resistance; $135 million in honey bee poisonings and reduced pollination; $70 million in losses of crops and trees; $11 million in fish and wildlife losses; and $140 million in miscellaneous losses. The estimated total of $839 million annual losses attributed to environmental and social costs of pesticide use represents only a small portion of the actual costs. A more complete accounting of the indirect costs would probably be several times the total reported. The results of this preliminary assessment underscore the serious nature of the environmental and social costs of pesticide use.		pesticide, cost, economic aspect, geographic distribution, United States, Apis mellifera, Apoidea, losses, pesticide use, poisonings, United States	1980-01-01
Electrophoretic purification of soluble trehalase from Drosophila melanogaster by selective unstacking	Specific activity of soluble trehalase from Drosophila melanogaster has been increased at least 10 times by preparative electrophoresis using selective unstacking. However, enzyme yield was poor, with only 17% of the original activity recovered. A comparison of Km of crude and partially purified trehalase revealed no difference (0.650 and 0.666 mm, respectively).

A review of safety tests on baculoviruses	In the late 1960's the degree of safety testing required of new candidate pesticides reached a climax. During this period, the nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) of Heliothis zea (Boddie) underwent a series of tests as thorough as those required for chemicals by the Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.) in the U.S.A. and by guidelines recommended by W.H.O. These included long term carcinogenicity and teratogenicity tests, tests on primates and tests on man. Indeed, the tests were far more demanding than the tests for chemicals because they examined the possibility of infection of test animals by the insect viruses. They led to the registration of a pioneer viral insecticide containing this NPV produced in caterpillars. Two other products from Lepidoptera, containing NPVs of Orgyia pseudotsugata (McDunn) and Lymantria dispar L. have satisfied the E.P.A. registration requirements. The NPV of Neodiprion sertifer (Geoffr.) (Hym.) has proved harmless in extensive tests, including long term tests. Another 3 NPVs, those of Autographa californica (Speyer)Spodoptera littoralisBoisd. and S. exempta (Walk.) passed tests not including the long term tests. Also a non-occluded baculovirus of a coleopteran, Oryctes rhinoceros L., has passed extensive pathogenicity tests and tests in cell lines. A number of other NPVs have been partially tested and limited tests have been made on 2 granulosis viruses (GV). The NPVs proved harmless to-and unable to replicate in-microorganisms, non-insect invertebrate cell lines vertebrate cell lines, vertebrates, plants and non-arthropod invertebrates. Replication was unusual in insects outside the insect family in which the virus was first found. GVs occur only in Lepidoptera, most are believed to be very specific and none have replicated in cell lines from insects or other animals. In addition, the rapidly expanding discipline of Invertebrate Pathology has failed to find incidence of NPVs and GVs infecting hosts outside the above stated host ranges. This is in reality a vast body of evidence matched only in extent by the absence of incidence of NPVs and GVs from the publications of medical, veterinary and phytopathology science. This evidence, and the accrued data from specific safety testing, gives increasing confidence that individual NPVs and GVs of Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera are very specific. This confidence suggests that new NPVs and GVs in these orders need be subjected only to a reduced range of the more challenging tests and to tests designed to reveal harm originating from the insect species used for virus production and from contaminants. © 1980 Le François.			1980-01-01
Biometric study of the corpora allata in scaptotrigona postica during post-embryonic development	Evidence from several papers indicates that corpora allata are important in insect development, at least during metamorphosis and the reproductive stage. In light of the morphological and functional variation among sexes and castes, a comparative study has been made on Scaptotrigona postica.At the beginning of metamorphosis the corpora allata of the queen were larger than those of the worker and male; this confirms the existence of a real dichotomy in the female caste. The corpora allata of the queen showed three cycles of activity, but those of the worker and male only one. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Sequence Organisation in Nuclear DNA from Physarum polycephalum Interspersion of Repetitive and Single‐Copy Sequences	Nuclear DNA from Physarum polycephalum is shown to contain three sequence components by reassociation kinetic analysis; a foldback component consisting of 6% of the DNA, a component with the properties of repetitive sequences comprising 31% of the DNA, and a majority component containing 63% of the DNA which reassociates with the kinetics characteristic of single‐copy sequences. The complement of repetitive sequences is comprised of about 80 families of repeated elements, each containing approximately 1800 repeats per family. On average, these sequences are 6.4% richer in guanine and cytosine than total Physarum nuclear DNA. The repetitive sequences within a single family appear not to be identical, since on denaturation and annealing they give rise to collections of heteroduplexes less stable than native DNA. It is calculated that these duplexes are about 10% mismatched on average. Hydroxyapatite binding of DNA fragments of different sizes containing reassociated repeated elements demonstrates that these sequences are interspersed with single‐copy sequences in a large portion of the Physarum genome. These observations are confirmed by direct examination of reassociated DNA using the electron microscope. In this manner it is shown that repetitive sequence elements possess a wide spectrum of lengths averaging 590 nucleotide residues, and they are separated by intervening segments of DNA about 930 residues in length.

Purification and properties of a-glucosidases of the honey bee apis mellifera l.	Two kinds of a-glucosidase (I and II) were isolated from honey bees by salting-out chromatography with ammonium sulfate. α -Glucosidase 1 was purified by chromatography on CMcellulose and gel filtration on Sephadex G-I00. α -Glucosidase II was purified by chromatographies on DEAE- and CM-cellulose and by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-I50. Both enzyme preparations were homogeneous in tests by disc electrophoresis. The molecular weight of —-glucosidases I and II was estimated to be approximately 9.8 x 104 and 7.6 x 104 respectively, by SDS disc electrophoresis. α-Glucosidases 1 and II were glycoproteins whose carbohydrate moieties were about 25% and 15%, respectively. Their pH optima were 5.0. Both a-glucosidases readily hydrolyzed phenyl- α -glucoside, sucrose and maltose. —-Glucosidase 1 showed no activity toward isomaltose and soluble starch, but —-glucosidase II showed relatively high activity toward isomaltose and slight activity toward soluble starch. © 1980, by the Agricultural Chemical Society of Japan.			1980-01-01
A second microsporidian in the honeybee	A microsporidian with a cylindrical spore 3.5 to 5.0 μm in length and 0.6 to 1.0 μm in diameter from three honeybee workers collected in southwestern Georgia is reported. Brief descriptions of developmental stages from wet and dry fixed smears and electron micrographs are given. Its lack of diplokarya, the presence of a single nucleus in the spore, and the presence of filopodia that appear to engulf host cytoplasm are its outstanding features. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Sterol utilization in honey bees fed a synthetic diet: Effects on brood rearing	The dietary sterols, cholesterol, campesterol, sitosterol, stigmasterol and 24-methylenecholesterol, were tested for their ability to support brood rearing in the honey bee, Apis mellifera L., by adding them singly to a chemically-defined worker bee diet. Diet supplemented with 24-methylenecholesterol supported the greatest survival of worker bees, but diet supplemented with either 24-methylenecholesterol or cholesterol supported the production of nearly equivalent amounts of sealed brood and more than any of the other three sterols tested. Diets containing stigmasterol, sitosterol, campesterol, or no supplement produced less sealed brood, in decreasing order. © 1980.			1980-01-01

Localization of short‐term memory in the brain of the bee, Apis mellifera	ABSTRACT. Fixed honey‐bees were conditioned to a scent in a one‐trial learning paradigm. In contrast to free‐flying colour‐conditioned bees, fixed scent‐conditioned bees do not show a biphasic time dependence of the conditioned response. Small metal probes were used to cool localized areas of the antennal lobes, alpha‐lobes, and calyces of the mushroom bodies of the brain at various times after conditioning. Localized cooling impaired the formation of memory in all three structures. The susceptibility to impairment after conditioning lasted approximately 3 min in the antennal lobes, 7 min in the alpha‐lobes, and 10 min in the calyx area. It was possible to determine the influence of the contralateral hemisphere (relative to the learning antenna) by conditioning bees with only one antenna. No contralateral impairment was found in the antennal lobes; there were minor effects in the alphalobes; contralateral cooling led to reductions of the conditioned response only in the calyx area. The temperature dependence of memory impairment was different for the antennal lobes and the mushroom bodies (alpha‐lobes and calyces). The latter were most sensitive to cooling at 5°C. No correlation between cooling duration and impairment of memory was found in the antennal lobes, but there was a linear relation between impairment and cooling duration in the alpha‐lobes. Brief cooling (5 or 10 s) resulted in significant impairment of memory formation only in the calyx area. A series of control experiments proved that the impairment of memory is due to a reversible block of neural activity. It was possible to show that the impairment is specific for the three neural structures analysed, by cooling the lobula of the optic system at various times after conditioning. Lesions of the brain or application of KCl also resulted in time‐dependent reductions of the conditioned response. Cooling the entire animal at various times after conditioning led to similar memory impairment to that resulting from localized cooling of the alphalobes. Copyright © 1980, Wiley Blackwell.

Flight patterns of foraging bees relative to density of artificial flowers and distribution of nectar	Flight patterns of honeybees (Apis mellifera ligustica) were quantified as the bees foraged among artificial 'flowers' for sugar solution ('nectar'). Bees exhibited considerable directionality on successive flights which minimized repeat visits to flowers and they usually made short flights to nearby flowers, thus minimizing flight time. The change in direction on successive flights between flowers were independent of the number of immediately preceding consecutive rewarding visits but decreased as the number of non-rewarding visits increased. Flight distances were short after visits to rewarding flowers but increased as the number of immediately preceding non-rewarding visits increased. The bees' rate of caloric intake (calories/time) was highest at the floral arrays having the highest density, and it was greater at arrays with clumped nectar-distributions than at those with randomly distributed nectar. These findings are explained in terms of the observed flight patterns. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.			1980-01-01
The development of juvenile hormone sensitivity in alatae of the aphid Megoura viciae	The juvenilizing effects of JH and JH mimics applied topically during pre- and postnatal development have been examined in alatiform larvae of the aphid Megoura viciae. Dose-response curves for the mimic hydroprene (ZR-512) indicate that sensitivity is greatest in the 3rd instar, rising progressively from the prenatal (embryonic) period through instars 1-2 and again declining precipitiously at the beginning of the final (4th) larval instar. This response pattern may be associated with the dual role of JH which probably controls both the metamorphosis of the mother and her parthenogenetic mode of reproduction under long day conditions. In the 3rd instar assay, the relative dose-effectiveness of JH I, II and III was 1 : 25 : 100. A 50% response was elicited by about 0.2 ng of JH I. Characters used in the scoring system (wings, pterothorax, abdominal sclerites) were all highly JH-labile, whereas other adult characters such as ocelli, the genital duct system and particularly the antennal placoid sensilla, were much less easily suppressed. Differences in organ susceptibility and the delayed effects of JH are tentatively attributed to differences in the frequency of tissue binding sites and to their prolonged occupancy by exogenous JH. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Sequence organisation in barley and oats chromosomes revealed by interspecies dna/dna hybridisation	The organisation of the repeated and non-repeated sequences in barley and oats genomes has been investigated using the repeated sequences of the wheat, oats, barley and rye genomes as DNA probes. Labelled barley and oats fragments of different lengths (200 to > 7000 nucleotides were hybridised to the repeated sequence probes and the proportions of the labelled fragments re- naturing with the probe DNAs were determined. The average spacings of these sequences through the barley and oats genomes were inferred from the results together with the proportions of the genomes in which the renatured sequences are concentrated. Over 70 per cent of barley and oats DNAs belong to families of repeated sequences. The few copy or non-repeated sequences in these genomes have a mean length of around 700 nucleotide pairs and are interspersed between repeated sequences. These findings have enabled schematic maps of the barley and oats genomes to be drawn. Both genomes appear to be constructed mostly of short sequences with neighbouring sequences being distinguished by their repetition frequency (repeated or nonrepeated) or their homology with different repeated sequence probes. Short non-repeated sequences interspersed with short repeated sequences are concentrated in regions occupying 50 to 60 per cent of the barley genome and 40 to 50 per cent of the oats genome. Most of the remaining DNA consists of tandemly arranged repeated sequences of different evolutionary origins. It is postulated that much of this complex repeated sequence DNA could have arisen from amplification of compound sequences each containing repeated and non-repeated sequences. © 1980 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.			1980-01-01
Activity of soluble and membrane-bound threhalase in apterous and alate morphs of Aphis citricola	1. 1. The optimum conditions for trehalase activity of either soluble or membrane-bound trehalase of both apterous and alate morphs of Aphis citricola were determined. 2. 2. Sodium deoxycholate (DOC) act as a solubilizing agent for membrane-bound trehalase, with no appreciable effect on its activity. 3. 3. Alates exhibit about a 50% higher level of soluble protein compared with that of apterase. Trehalase activity of this fraction in alates is 70-85% higher than that in apterase, as determined per mg protein or per aphid. The activity of the membrane-bound trehalase was on the same level in both morphs when determined relative to mg protein. 4. 4. The relative high activity of the soluble trehalase in alates may reflect an increased energy supply needed for sustaining physical activity involved in aphid flight. © 1980.			1980-01-01

Diagnosis and treatment of anaphylactic reactions to Hymenoptera stings in children	Forty-four children (mean age 9.6 years) with a history of an allergic reaction(s) to an insect sting and with positive insect venom skin tests were studied. IgE antibodies (RAST) to honeybee phospholipase A and to yellow jacket venom were found in the sera of 78% and 77%, respectively, of these patients. The patients were immunized with the appropriate venoms over a 15-week course and most were then subjected to an in-hospital sting; there was a 3% reaction rate (1/37). Clinical protection was associated with a fivefold increase in anti-venom IgG. Five patients did not develop a significant increase in IgG antibody and they were treated more vigorously; four were stung subsequently without reaction. Two patients dit not react when stung in the field; positive identification of the culprit insect was obtained. Twenty patients were re-stung after one year of maintenance therapy; there was a single mild, delayed reaction. Immunotherapy also increased the IgE antibody against venom 3.7-fold at three months; after one year of therapy the IgE antibody level had decreased but was still 40% greater than at the outset. Immunotherapy was associated with a 25% incidence of local pain and swelling and a 6% incidence of systemic reactions. We conclude that venom therapy in children is safe and effective. The indications for initiating immunotherapy require further definition. © 1980 The C. V.

Specificity of sugar cane trehalase	An extract containing trehalase and invertase was prepared from apical internodes of sugar cane. The extract hydrolysed three glucosides: maltose, trehalose and sucrose. By reprecipitation with ammonium sulphate, maltase and trehalase activities appear to be due to different enzymes. As was also shown by differential inhibition and activation and by studies on the behaviour of both enzymes during growth, invertase and trehalase activities are attributed to different enzymes whose activities do not overlap. Invertase-free preparations confirm these results. Sucrose is a simple competitive inhibitor of sugar cane trehalase, excluding a regulatory role for this sugar. Sucrose was found at inhibitory levels in the first four apical internodes. A close correlation between sugar cane growth and invertase and trehalase levels was found in the apical internodes. Invertase has the greatest activity during growing, and trehalase reaches a maximum at maturity, prior to the flowering process. The high levels of trehalase in the flower suggest that the enzyme is involved in flowering or in related processes linked to seed formation. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Evolution of haplodiploidy: Models for inbred and outbred systems	Several new models are proposed for the evolution of haplodiploidy. Each of these models is evaluated for its ability to explain (1) special problems associated with transition to haplodiploidy from a population of diplodiploid progenitors, (2) current patterns of population structure in haplodiploid and related species, and (3) the evolution of genetic systems similar but not identical to haplodiploid systems. Of the new models, three are based on special conditions associated with inbreeding. Close inbreeding provides for the automatic effects of reduced problems in expressing recessives, lowered differences in gain from heterozygosity (to produce both heterotic effects and a greater variety of offspring) between haploid and diploid males, effective protection of haploids from direct competition with diploids, and a mechanism for the spread of haplodiploidy through gains derived from increased ability to control sex ratio. These models differ in the context where gain from sex ratio control is expressed. Pathways for the evolution of haplodiploidy in outbreeding populations are also discussed. Females who parthenogenetically produce haploid males have high genetic relatedness to their sons. If the sperm of these males is used to make both sons and daughters, i.e., through matings with diplodiploid females, there may be a net gain for haplodiploids. Another outbreeding model, modified from S. W. Brown (1964, Genetics 49, 797-817), deals with selection for females producing haploid males in populations where there are driving sex chromosomes. Biases created by drive in sex ratio may allow haplodiploid females to be the only effective producers of males in the population. Several of the new models explain the whole range of haplodiploid and related adaptations and provide predictions that appear to be more consistent with the known structure of contemporary populations than those available in current models. © 1980.		animal, article, biological model, breeding, diploidy, evolution, female, haploidy, male, parthenogenesis, sex ratio, Animal, Breeding, Diploidy, Evolution, Female, Haploidy, Male, Models, Genetic, Parthenogenesis, Sex Ratio, Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.	1980-01-01
Biosynthesis of wax in the honeybee, Apis mellifera L.	The composition of the cuticular wax of the honeybee is quantitatively different from that of the comb wax. The major component of the cuticular lipids is hydrocarbon, which comprises 58% of this wax. In contrast, hydrocarbon comprises only 13-17% of the comb wax, and monoester is the largest component (Tulloch 1971). The major fractions of the cuticular wax were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography, and were shown to be qualitatively similar to those of the comb wax. The incorporation of injected radio-labelled acetate into hexane extractable wax by worker honeybees not actively producing comb wax resulted in the recovery of much of the radioactivity in the hydrocarbon fraction. In insects actively producing comb wax, a higher percentage of radioactivity was recovered in the monoester fraction. A dramatic effect of age on the distribution of radioactivity from acetate into the various wax fractions from honeybees studied in the summer months was observed. In insects from eleven to eighteen days following emergence to adults, the major wax component synthesized was monoester, whereas in younger and older insects, hydrocarbon was the major wax component formed. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments using insects actively producing comb wax showed that the abdomen produced significant amounts of monoester, hydrocarbon, and other esters, whereas the thorax synthesized mostly hydrocarbon. These data show that the epidermal cells and wax glands each produce a wax with a distinct composition, and that the age and seasonal differences observed in wax synthesis are due to the presence or absence of active wax glands. © 1980.			1980-01-01
An electron microscopic study of spermatogenesis in the drone of scaptotrigona postica (hymenoptera, apidae)	Gonocyst growth in the drone of S. postica is characterized by a series of 5 synchronous mitoses in which cytokinesis is incomplete, and the original cells remain interconnected until spermatozoa formation.During meiosis the division of spermatocytes I was terminated with an anomalous metaphase plate formation at the end of prophase (I). A concentric endoplasmic reticulum encircled the metaphase chromosomes; though microtubuleswere present, spindles were not formed. This abortive division also affected the particular behavior of the centrioles. Although the centrioles proliferated during prophase I, they did not give rise to a spindle, but became associated with the formation of centriolar blebs at cell surface, and seemed eventually to be eliminated.In S. postica, the chromosome number is maintained due to the abortiveness of the first meiotic division; therefore, chromosome distribution is normal during the subsequent division. The second meiotic division resulted in the formation of two spermatids, one of which has a greatly reduced amount of cytoplasm. Nevertheless, bothspermatids formed what look like normal sperm cells. Thus, the Scaptotrigona drone produces 2 rather than 4 sperm cells from each spermatocyte. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.			1980-01-01
EFFECT OF INTRACELLULAR INJECTION OF EGTA AND TETRAETHYLAMMONIUM CHLORIDE ON THE RECEPTOR POTENTIAL OF LOCUST PHOTORECEPTORS	Abstract— The depolarizing photoreceptor potential of locust, Valanga irregularis, as that of other arthropods, has an initial transient phase that declines to a stable sustained phase. In this work, the effect of intracellular injection of EGTA and TEA on these phases was studied. (1) Reversal potential of the transient phase was higher than that of the sustained phase. (2) EGTA and TEA enhanced both phases and the enhancement was more prominent in the sustained phase. (3) Resting potential was shifted slightly upward by the injection. The amplitude of the maximum response was also increased. (4) Current injected through an electrode filled with 2 M KCl had a significant effect on the shape of the response depending on the direction of the current. (5) It is suggested that the activation of K+ conductance induced by an increase of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration causes a decrease in amplitude of the sustained phase.

The effect of pretraining procedures and discriminative stimuli on the development of food selection behaviors in the toad (Bufo terrestris)	The present research explored the ability of the toad (Bufo terrestris) to discriminate between palatable and unpalatable prey objects based on prey color (Experiment 1) and background color (Experiment 2). The first experiment investigated the effects of prior experience with a prey object on the subsequent discrimination task. The results indicated that prior positive experience with the palatable prey object facilitated the early development of the discrimination. The second experiment showed that the toad could discriminate between identical prey objects on the basis of background color. © 1980 Academic Press, Inc.		animal experiment, central nervous system, feeding behavior, Animal, Association Learning, Bufonidae, Color Perception, Discrimination Learning, Food Preferences, Reinforcement (Psychology), Taste	1980-01-01
The control of nest depth in a digger wasp (Sphex ichneumoneus L.)	Golden digger wasps, Sphex ichneumoneus L. (Sphecidae), are a solitary, ground-nesting species that dig burrows to particular depths in the soil. I develop and evaluate alternative hypeses about the mechanisms controlling digging behaviour. By altering the wasps' burrows as thare digging, I show that they are not digging for some prescribed length of time nor are they diggingtil they reach some suitable environmental characteristic deep in the soil. Rather, they appear be digging until they reach a particular tunnel length, making corrections if the tunnel is too shallor too deep. This distance can be altered somewhat by surface environmental conditions. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Alcoholic bouin fixation of insect nervous systems for bodian silver staining. II. Modified solutions	A previously devised synthetic equivalent of 'aged' alcoholic Bouin (Duboscq-Brasil) fixative was modified in various ways to discover which of the chemical changes brought about by aging were important in improving fixation and staining. Effects were tested with ventral nerve cord ganglia of the cockroach Periplaneta americana, locust Schistocerca gregaria, and honey bee Apis mellifera. Formation of reaction products, chiefly ethyl acetate and diethoxymethane, seemed to play only a subsidiary role: neither individually appeared essential as long as a sufficient quantity of one or the other was present. In place of diethoxymethane, ethyl acetate concentration could be increased to 25% with little effect on results. Reduction in concentration of two of the original constituents, formaldehyde and ethanol, appeared to be the principal factor in improving fixation. Varying the concentration of each original constituent individually revealed that formaldehyde mainly increased glial staining, ethanol increased tissue shrinkage and reduced overall staining intensity, acetic acid improved preservation, and picric acid decreased glial staining but produced few other effects within a wide range of concentrations, though its omission seriously impaired overall preservation and staining. Varying the ethanol and acetic acid concentrations simultaneously confirmed that they acted in opposite ways. A decrease in ethanol and an increase in acetic acid both improved results. The optimum mixture, 'improved synthetic alcoholic Bouin' (40% formaldehyde 0-15: ethanol 25: acetic acid 5: ethyl acetate 5: diethoxymethane 15: picric acid 0.5: water to 100), gives better preservation and more intense staining, and formaldehyde content can be varied to give the degree of glial staining required. Without formaldehyde glial staining is virtually eliminated, while preservation and staining of the neurons appears unaffected. This modification seems to offer a valuable advance in technique. © 1980 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.		arthropod, fixation, histology, methodology, nervous system, nervous tissue, silver impregnation	1980-01-01
Observations on insect pollinators of Lycopersicon peruvianum and L. esculentum in relation to the production of F<inf>1</inf>hybrid tomato seed	Bombus griseocollis (DeGreer) was found to be the most common visitor to flowers of Lycopersicon peruvianum at Fort Collins (Larimer County) Colorado. Five other species of Bombus were less frequently observed on the flowers along with an occasional Apis mellifera L. No pollinating insects were observed visiting blossoms of L. esculentum during the entire flowering period. An efficient system to attract insect pollinators is apparently present in L. peruvianum but not in L. esculentum. We suggest that this system be transferred to L. esculentum genetically to make possible the production of inexpensive F1 hybrid tomato seed. A strategy for accomplishing this transfer is presented. Beobachtungen über Insekten als Bestäuber bei Lycopersicon peruvianum und L. esculentum in Beziehung zur Produktion von F1‐Hybridentomatensamen Die Hummel, Bombus griseocollis (DeGreer) erwies sich als haufigste Besucherin der Blüten von L. peruvianum im Gebiet von Fort Collins (Larimer County) in Colorado. 5 andere Bombus‐Arten zeigten geringere Frequenz, ebenso die Honigbiene, Apis mellifera L. Dagegen wurden während der ganzen Blütezeit bei L. esculentum keine bestaubenden Insekten in den Blüten beobachtet. Augenscheinlich ist nur bei L. peruvianum, nicht aber bei L. esculentum ein wirksames Anlocksystem fur Bestauber entwickelt. Es wird angenommen, daß dieses System von L. esculentum genetisch übertragen wird, um die Produktion von F1‐Habridentomatensamen zu ermöglichen.

Insect Pollination of Sunflower (Helianthus Annuus) in Pakistan	In 1975 and 1976 bee visitors on ‘Armaveric’ sunflower were Andrena fulvicrus, Apis dorsata, A.florea, Ceratina viridissima and Xylocopa dissimilis especially during early and middle parts of the day. Studies on bagged and open seed heads, and on those sprayed with phosphamidon, showed the need for insect pollination for a high yield of good quality seed. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Immunological comparison of phospholipases A<inf>2</inf>present in rattlesnake (genus Crotalus) venoms	The immunological properties of phospholipase A2 present in venoms from seven species of rattlesnakes (genus Crotalus) from different geographical distributions have been compared. Rabbit antiserum to purified PLA2 of Crotalus scutulatus salvini venom was used, employing inhibition of enzymic activity and immunodiffusion techniques. The amount of antiserum required for 50% inhibition of the PLA2 activity in the venoms varied from slightly more than that required for inhibition of the activity in the homologous venom to a large amount (effectively zero inhibition). A particularly close relationship in the antigenic makeup was observed between the phospholipases of C. s. salvini and C. atrox venoms as evidenced by inhibition of enzymic activity and immunodiffusion studies. No immunological cross reactivity was observed between the enzymes of the subspecies C. s. salvini and C. s. scutulatus. The results suggest extensive variations in the antigenic structure of the phospholipase molecules. The findings may also have some taxonomic significance. © 1980.		antigen, phospholipase a, snake venom, animal experiment, immunodiffusion, preliminary communication, reptile, Animal, Comparative Study, Crotalid Venoms, Immunodiffusion, Molecular Conformation, Phospholipases, Phospholipases A, Rabbits, Species Specificity	1980-01-01
Metabolism of tyramine in the central nervous system of the moth Manduca sexta	Three distinct metabolites of tyramine are produced by central nervous tissue of pharate-adult Manduca sexta incubated in vitro with [3H]-tyramine. The chemical identities of these metabolites have been sought by a combination of electrophoretic, chromatographic, hydrolytic and enzymic procedures. One of the compounds is N-acetyltyramine, and the others appear to be β-alanyltyramine and a sugar conjugate, possibly of N-acetyltyramine. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Fluorimetric method for the determination of juvenoid esterase activity in insects	Esters of JH-III and of other juvenoid acids with 4-methylumbelliferone are hydrolysed by carboxylesterase enzymes present in the haemolymph and tissues of insects. The rate of their hydrolysis can be easily monitored due to the intensive fluorescence of free 4-methylumbelliferone. The fluorimetric method described makes possible routine determinations of picomole amounts of the hydrolysed juvenoid ester. Carboxylesterase enzymes that hydrolyse 4-methylumbelliferyl esters of JH-III have a Km of 0.93 × 10-6 M. These and other such juvenoid esterases have pH optima between 7.5 and 8.0. They occur in the haemolymph of various insect species and are extremely sensitive to inhibition by diisopropylphosphorofluoridate. In contrast, the monoacyl lipase enzymes that hydrolyse 4-methylumbelliferyl oleate are virtually insensitive to the inhibitor. It is concluded that the minimum, hormonally effective, in vivo concentration of many juvenoid esters occurs far below the Km values of the hydrolytic enzymes thus protecting them from metabolic inactivation. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Application of methoxymercuration-demercuration followed by mass spectrometry as a convenient microanalytical technique for double-bond location in insect-derived alkenes	The positions of double bonds in olefins can be readily determined by a sodium borohydride reduction of their methoxymercuration products followed by mass spectrometry. Fragmentation of the methoxy derivative in the mass spectrometer results in cleavage on either side of the methoxy group to give intense fragment ions which are characteristic of each isomer. This simple and convenient microanalytical technique was applied to several synthetic standards and insect derived olefins, including the alkenes from the cuticular lipids of the honeybee Apis mellifera L. © 1980 Plenum Publishing Corporation.			1980-01-01

Immunological methods based on antigen-coupled bacteriophages	Simple chemicals, many proteins, nucleic acids or polysaccharides can be coupled to bacteriophages without completely destroying their infectivity. The coupled phages are then sensitive to inactivation by the relevant antibodies. Thus it is possible to construct phage inactivation assays for antibodies or inactivation inhibition assays for antigens. The advantages of the bacteriophage methods include superior sensitivity and good stability of the reagents. The phage inactivation method defects preferably high-affinity antibodies, but what really matters is a high avidity. Because of the polyvalency IgM antibodies can have a high avidity associated with moderate affinity, and therefore low amounts of IgM class antibody, for instance natural antibody, are often measurable by this test. The chemical conjugation inactivates a proportion of the bacteriophages. If the antigen can be made chemically reactive (self-coupling), approximately 10% of the phage particles escape this inactivation and can serve as indicators of antibody action. When the antigen cannot be made chemically reactive, this inactivation is more complete and the phage assay is less satisfactory. © 1980.		immunoglobulin m, antibody detection, bacteriophage, methodology, virus inhibition, Animal, Antibody Affinity, Antibody Specificity, Bacteriophage phi X 174, Bacteriophages, Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic, Human, Immunologic Techniques, Neutralization Tests, Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, T-Lymphocytes, T-Phages	1980-01-01

The value of white clover Trifolium repens L., Cultivar S100 planted on motorway verges to honeybees Apis mellifera L.	During two years the preferences shown by bees for five cultivars of white clover (S100, S184, Sabeda, Kent Wild and New Zealand Huia) were tested. Honeybees and bumblebees visited all the cultivars, but S100, the cultivar commonly planted on motorway verges, was one of the most attractive to them. © 1980, All rights reserved.			1980-01-01
Some Properties of Acetylcholinesterases Partially Purified from Susceptible and Resistant Green Rice Leafhoppers, Nephotettix Cincticeps Uhler (Hemiptera: Deltocephalidae)	Properties of acetylcholinesterases (AChE) in the green rice leafhopper were examined using partially purified normal and modified AChEs. The modified enzyme was much less sensitive to inhibition by propoxur and malaoxon than the normal one, but highly sensitive to inhibition by diazoxon. Substrate specificity and effect of pH on activity of the normal enzyme were similar to those of the bovine erythrocyte AChE used as a reference enzyme, but those of the modified AChE were obviously different from those of the other enzymes. On the other hand, difference of the normal and modified AChEs in the Km values of substrates was rather small, i.e., by a factor of less than 2. It may be concluded that the modified AChE alters in a binding site, which is related to the reaction with inhibitors, but different from the site for the intrinsic substrate acetylcholine. © 1980, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

Studies on a peptide with red pigment-concentrating and hyperglycemic activity from the cephalic endocrine system of the honeybee, Apis mellifera	Shrimp red pigment-concentrations hormone (RPCH), locust adipokinetic hormone (AKH), and locust Compound I all elevate hemolymph lipid in locusts and concentrate pigment in shrimp erythrophores. In addition, RPCH and AKH both elevate hemolymph carbohydrate in cockroaches. Material with comparable biological activity has been reported in many insects, but not in representatives of the order Hymenoptera. Distilled water head extracts of the honeybe, Apis, exhibited red pigment-concentrating activity in the shrimp Leander and hyperglycemic activity in the cockroach Periplaneta. Chemical characterization of the active substance in Apis extracts showed that like RPCH, AKH, and Compound II, it was heat stable, soluble in butanol and methanol, degraded by proteolytic enzymes, and localized in the cephalic neuroendocrine system. Similarly, like RPCH and Compound II, but unlike AKH, the Apis substance eluted at 1.2 Vt during Sephadex G-25 gel filtration. The data thus provide the initial demonstration that the endocrine system of at least one hymenopteran contains a peptide that is chemically and biologically comparable to the RPCH/AKH/Compound II group of hormonally active peptides. Furthermore, the results support the hypothesis that such peptides may be commonly used as hormones in holometabolic insects. In addition, pure Compound II was shonw for the first time to be hyperglycemic in the cockroach. © 1980.		carbohydrate, lipid, red pigment concentrating hormone, animal experiment, arthropod, drug analysis, endocrine system, hemolymph, Animal, Bees, Biological Assay, Blood Glucose, Cockroaches, Decapoda (Crustacea), Grasshoppers, Head, Hemolymph, Invertebrate Hormones, Male, Oligopeptides, Pigmentation, Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.	1980-01-01
Genetic Background of Sexuality in the Diploid Drone Honeybee	According to the latest version of the genie balance hypothesis, diploid drones should show super-male characters. Almost 38 thousand measurements or counts on haploid and diploid drones, and queens and workers, showed that (except the testes and structures on the wings) all characters were larger in diploid than in haploid drones. Many body parts of the haploid drone were larger than those of females, but some (such as mouthparts and abdomen parts) were smaller. Diploid drone body parts, being larger than those of the haploids, showed (in relation to the females) super-male character in half the dimensions investigated and, in the other half, inclination toward female characters ranging from intersex through caste and female to super-female characters. Of 10 body parts larger in females than in haploid drones, only one was smaller in diploid than in haploid drones, exhibiting a super-male character. The others tended toward female characters. In size, diploid drone body parts were closer to the queen than to the worker. Thus the main difference between the haploid and diploid drone was the larger size of the diploid and not a shift in one direction of sexuality; this disagrees with the genic balance hypothesis. The sexuality of diploid drone body parts depends upon their size and upon the relation to the haploid drone and to the females. However, the size of different body parts is not the result of genie balance, but of higher polyploidization of body tissues. This hypothesis enables a forecast to be made of sexuality of body parts not yet investigated. Higher polyploidization will cause larger body parts in diploid than in haploid drones. Diploid drone body parts will show super-male character if the parts are larger in the haploid drone than in females, and an inclination toward the female character if the parts are smaller in the haploid drone than in the females. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Effects of carbon dioxide and cold anaesthesia on the hoarding behaviour of the honeybee	Hoarding behaviour of groups of newly emerged adult honeybees was measured after they had been exposed to CO2 for 10 min, or exposed to CO2 for long enough to immobilize them, or exposed to cold. Both CO2 and cold affected hoarding behaviour. Bees exposed to CO2 for 10 min initially hoarded less, and later hoarded more, than controls. The hoarding rate of bees exposed to CO2 only long enough to immovilize them, or exposed to cold, was generally depressed throughout the experiment. Due to the complex changes in hoarding that follow CO2 treatment, cold is judged to be the preferred anaesthetic for use in hoarding experiments. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Studies in warning coloration and mimicry. VIII. Further evidence for a frequency-dependent model of predation.	Laboratory experiments used toads, Bufo terrestris, and treefrogs, Hyla cinerea, as predators and honeybees Apis mellifera as models. Bees from which the stinging apparatus had been removed served as mimics. Model and mimic bees were offered randomly with the models at frequencies of 10%, 30%, and 50% to the toads and 10%, 20%, and 50% to the treefrogs. The corresponding percentages of the model-mimic population eaten were 53.6%, 35.3%, and 19.8% (toads) and 29.6%, 17.4%, and 7.0% (treefrogs). The frequencies of bees eaten as a function of percent models in the prey population can be described by a mathematical model of predation. Predator memory values (n) of 8.0 (toads) and 28.7 (treefrogs) were obtained. Various factors affecting the behavior of the predator with respect to the value of n are discussed: toxicity vs distastefulness, alternate prey, and predator strategy. It is concluded that n is better viewed as a risk-taking strategy on the part of the predator than as a simple memory parameter. -Author		Apis mellifera, Bufo terrestris, honeybee, Hyla cinerea, toad, treefrog	1980-01-01
The effect of juvenile hormone on pupal pigmentation of Pieris brassicae L.	The role of juvenile hormone (JH) in the morphological colour adaptation of pupae of Pieris brassicae controlled by environmental factor was analyzed. First the effects of JH I and its analogue, Farnesyl-Methyl-Ether (FME) were tested. Secondly the JH-titres of the last instar larvae were measured under various light conditions which influence the future pigmentation of the pupae. During the sensitive period, which occurs before pupation, blue light (410 nm) produces the strongest, darkness medium, and yellow light (570 nm) the lightest pigmentation of the pupae. JH I as well as FME has an inhibiting effect on the formation of the black spots in the cuticle. However, this effect only becomes apparent (a) if the insects are kept under blue light during the sensitive period (which normally leads to a strong black pigmentation) and (b) only when these animals were treated with JH I or FME either at the beginning, or 10 hr after the beginning of the sensitive period. In the last larvae instar, JH could be found only during the sensitive period. Fourteen hours after the beginning of the sensitive period the JH concentration reaches a maximum of 30-100 pg JH per insect. The JH-titre resulting from blue light conditions is significantly different from those of the larvae kept under white or yellow light. An additional maximum of 60 pg JH per animal was found 8 hr/after the beginning of the sensitive period. Obviously, JH affects the process of pigmentation of the pupae, but the described results are not sufficient to explain thoroughly the regulation of pigmentation modified by environmental factors. The effects of further factors are discussed. © 1980.			1980-01-01

Ultrastructure des organes retrocerebraux de Lasius niger l. (Hymenoptera : Formicidae)	The ultrastructure of the retrocerebral system has been studied in hyperactive workers of the ant, Lasius niger. The paired elongated corpora cardiaca consist of 2 parts: the glandular part that lies in a dorsolateral position, and the more developed nervous part. In the neural area, 4 types of neurosecretory axons can be distinguished according to the size and density of their granules. The glandular cells contain numerous dense granules and large dense bodies whose nature is uncertain; they mingle with the axons of only one type. Each of the 2 anterior corpora allata is located near the nervous part of each corpus cardiacum; they consist of about 12 large cells whose plasma membrane shows many digitations; 2 types of axons can be seen in the dilated intercellular spaces. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Ein mathematisches Simulationsmodell zur Abschätzung der Populationsentwicklung im Bienenvolk (Apis mellifera L.) nach Befall mit der Milbe Varroa jacobsoni Oud.

The effect of volume, ventilation and overheating of bee colonies on the construction of swarming queen cups and cells	1. 1. Experiments were carried out during two swarming seasons to study the effects of increased hive volume and ventilation, as well as that of colony overheating on the construction of swarming queen cups and cells, issuing of swarms and honey yields. 2. 2. Queen cups were constructed by all colonies, but their number varied from one year to another. Only one cup, out of 10 or 20, was transformed to a swarming queen cell. 3. 3. Fewer queen cups were transformed to queen cells by colonies maintained inside large-volume hives (low population density) than by congested colonies. 4. 4. Increased hive volume and ventilation exerted an inhibitory effect on the construction of swarming queen cups, cells and on issuing of swarms. 5. 5. Overheating of congested bee colonies significantly affected the early construction of swarming queen cups, cells and their swarming. 6. 6. Although, non-significant at P < 0.05, the honey yields obtained from colonies in high-volume, ventilated hives, were higher than those from control colonies. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Activity of β-Galactosidase in the Midgut of the Honeybee	The presence of β-galactosidase in the honeybee is reported here for the first time: activity was found in midgut homogenates of the adult worker. When lactose was used as the substrate, honeybee β-galactosidase at 37°C was most active at pH 4·0–5·0, when hydrolysis of lactose was completed in 60 min. The gut β-galactosidase showed a temperature optimum of 37°C, and was not stable at room temperature. The β-galactosidase had a Km constant at 24 mM.

Development of the endoplasmic reticulam during human spermatogenesis	Human primary spermatocytes show a special development of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). During the leptotene-zygotene stages a cisterna of ER surrounds a third or half of the nucleus closely associated with the nuclear envelope and connected with it. In the following stages of the first meiotic prophase, stacks of these cisternae appear closely related to the nucleus and show connections with other cytoplasmic cisternae which are free in the cytoplasm. In the secondary spermatocytes and spermatids, the number of ER cisternae joined to the nucleus decreases; in contrast, the number of free ER cisternae increases. Another peculiar differentiation of the ER, such as the annulate lamellae (AL), appears in the late stages of the first meiotic prophase in relation with the nuclear envelope. AL are conspicuous in secondary spermatocytes and spermatids. In spermatids, AL appear either joined to the nucleus or free in the cytoplasm, in close proximity to the Golgi complex. Finally, AL and other membranes of the ER are released in the cytoplasmic droplets of the maturing spermatids. © 1980 S. Karger AG, Basel.			1980-01-01
Pollination of the rain-forest tree Syzygium tierneyanum (Myrtaceae) at Kuranda, Northern Queensland	The identity, abundance and foraging behaviour of pollinators of the self-compatible, mass-flowering Syzygium tierneyanum were investigated. Forty-five species of nectarivorous animals were recorded. Diurnal visitors included seven bird, nine butterfly. four moth (including two hawkmoth), two bee, two ant, one wasp, three blowfly, one fruit fly, two beetle and one weevil species. while nocturnal visitors included one bat and 12 moth (including three hawkmoth) species. Floral dimensions were such that only the vertebrate and larger insect species regularly contacted anthers and stigmas while foraging. Of these groups the feral honey bee (Apis mellifera) was the most common flowet visitor. Honeyeaters and hawkmoths appeared to be the most important native pollinators; they were abundant in the study area and visited numerous flowers (50-250) in quick succession (1-3 s per flower) on each foraging bout. The only major differences in foraging times observed in the pollinator array were between diurnal, diurnal and crepuscular, and nocturnal floral visitors. Spatial partitioning of the nectar resource was limited to one instance of territoriality involving a Macleay’s honeyeater (Meliphaga rnacleayana) on a densely flowering branch prior to peak blooming time, occasional aggressive chases by honeyeaters, and a division of foraging modes into rapid, erratic flights of 0.5-4 m between flowers (hawkmoths) as against nearest-flower movements (all other groups). This lack of major spatial partitioning may have been due to the mass flowering of S. tierneyanum and the resultant superabundance of nectar. The vast majority (c. 99.95%) of interflower movements observed in foraging bouts of birds (and of hawkmoths) were within the same plant. This suggests that most seeds of S. tierneyanum may be derived from self-pollination. © 1980 CSIRO. All rights resereved.			1980-01-01
Amplification of the classical complement pathway by the venom of the Mojave rattlesnake (Crotalus scutulatus scutulatus)	The lytic attack of human red blood cells by complement was enhanced by the venom of the Mojave rattlesnake (Crotalus scutulatus scutulatus). Lysis, however, of sheep red blood cells by complement was not enhanced by this venom. Western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) venom was anticomplementary. Enhanced lysis of human red blood cells by Mojave venom required that the red blood cells be sensitized with antibodies and that the complement system be intact. Heat inactivation of complement (56°C, 30 min) prevented lysis of red blood cells. Moreover, heating of the Mojave venom (66°C, 60 min) prevented enhanced lysis. Lytic enhancement was time, dose and temperature dependent. It is postulated that membrane active venom components enhance the efficiency of the complete complement cascade for red blood cell lysis to occur, because venom increased the lytic reaction rate. © 1980.		complement, snake venom, blood and hemopoietic system, complement activation, dose time effect relation, drug response, hemolysis, human cell, in vitro study, normal human, Animal, Complement Activation, Complement Pathway, Classical, Crotalid Venoms, Erythrocytes, Guinea Pigs, Heat, Hemolysis, Human, In Vitro, Sheep, Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.	1980-01-01
The process of differentiation during spermatogenesis in bees (Hymenoptera, apidae)	The structural changes during spermatogenesis were studied on developing spermatogonia in drone testes of seven species of bees including the honeybee Apis mellifera and six other stingless bees. In view of the uniqueness of the spermatogenic process in the honeybee haploid drone this study was made in order to compare the events characteristic of spermatogenesis in other bees. Based on the results obtained we conclude that usually the primary spermatocytes undergo an abortive first meiotic division and further an unequal division of the secondary -spermatocyte. This mechanism in associated to the formation of centriolar blebs. The main difference observed is concerned with the premeiotic cell division (4 in Apis and 5 ones in other bees). The poliploidy seems to have no effect on the chromosome distribution in meiotic cells even if occurs the pairing of the homologous. Very few interespecific variations during spermatid differentiation were confirmed. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.			1980-01-01
In vitro N-Acetylation of biogenic amines by tissues of the european corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis Hübner	[14C]-N-Acetyltryptamine was the major product of tryptamine metabolism using whole larval European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) (Hübner) homogenates, as well as homogenates of corn borer brain, suboesophageal ganglion, nervecord, gut, Malpighian tubule, fat body and carcass, with either [14C]-tryptamine or [14C]-acetyl CoA as the labelled substrate. Indoleacetic acid and indoleacetaldehyde, the products of tryptamine metabolism by monoamine oxidase (MAO), were barely detectable, indicating that tryptamine metabolism in both neural and non-neural larval corn borer tissues is catalyzed predominantly by an arylamine acetyltransferase (AAT) rather than MAO. The highest specific activity of AAT was found in brain homogenates, although the highest activities per insect equivalent of tissue were found in carcass and fat body homogenates. The AAT activity in brain and carcass homogenates towards eight indolealkylamines and phenylethylamines showed clear differences in substrate specificity, particularly in the preference found in carcass but not brain homogenates for β-hydroxylated phenylethylamines over unsubstituted analogues. These results suggest that neural AAT may be a different enzyme than that found in non-neural tissues. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Zum Meidenlernen ungenießbarer Beute bei Vögeln: Der Einfluß der Faktoren Umlernen, neue Alternativbeute und Ähnlichkeit der Alternativbeute	The process of learning to avoid an unpalatable insect was investigated in 35 caged starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Following a 2 × 2 × 2 design three factors were examined: relearning—an insect palatable at first is later on made unpalatable, new alternative prey, and similarity of appearance of alternative prey. The learning process was delayed by each of them, whereby the effect of the third factor was much stronger than those of the first and second ones. The effects are combined by multiplication rather than by arithmetic summation. Under difficult learning conditions some birds ceased to operate the insect feeder used. From a comparison of experimental and field conditions it is concluded that in the field birds learn to avoid unpalatable insects rather quickly. The significance of the results for Batesian mimicry is discussed. In Käfigversuchen wurde geprüft, wie Stare (Sturnus vulgaris) unter verschiedenen Bedingungen ein vergälltes Insekt meiden lernen. Dabei wurde der Einfluß folgender Faktoren auf den Lernvorgang untersucht: a) Umlernen: ein vorher unvergälltes Insekt ist im Lernversuch vergällt; b) neue Alternativbeute: das neben dem vergällten gebotene Insekt ist für den Vogel neu; c) Ähnlichkeit der Alternativbeute: das vergällte und das unvergällte Insekt des Lernversuchs sind einander ähnlich. Aus den drei Faktoren, die jeweils entweder wirksam oder nicht wirksam waren, ergaben sich durch Kombination 8 verschiedene Versuchsbedingungen (Versuchsplan drei Faktoren in zwei Stufen), die an je einer Gruppe von 4 oder 5, insgesamt an 35 Staren getestet wurden. Alle Vt erhielten dasselbe vergällte Insekt; die einzelnen Gruppen unterschieden sich nur durch die Alternativbeute im Lernversuch und/oder die vor dem Lernversuch gebotenen Insekten. War keiner der Faktoren wirksam, so lernten die Vt sehr rasch, das vergällte Insekt abzulehnen, d. h. schon nach einer Sitzung in mehr als 90% der Fälle. Demgegenüber verzögerte der Faktor Umlernen den Lernvorgang und verursachte ein etwas niedrigeres Meideniveau (6.—10. Sitzung: 83%). Der Faktor neue Alternativbeute bewirkte zwar, daß die Vt in der 1. Sitzung schon 43% der vergällten Insekten mieden, führte aber zu einem noch niedrigeren Meideniveau (72%). Die Kombination beider Faktoren hatte wohl eine weitere Verzögerung des Lernvorgangs, aber keine weitere Absenkung des Meideniveaus (73%) zur Folge. Bei dem Faktor Ähnlichkeit der Alternativbeute mieden die Vt erst spät, d. h. nach sechs Sitzungen, durchschnittlich mehr als 50% der vergällten Beute. Kam zu diesem Faktor noch Umlernen hinzu, so wurde die 50%‐Marke erst nach sieben Sitzungen überschritten. Waren die Faktoren Ähnlichkeit und neue Alternativbeute kombiniert, so hatten die Vt Schwierigkeiten mit der gestellten Aufgabe: Alle lehnten nach anfänglichem Probieren nicht nur den vergällten, sondern auch den unvergällten Insektentyp ab. Nur zwei lernten später, den unvergällten zu fressen, die übrigen drei verloren das Interesse am verwendeten Insektengeber. Noch größere Schwierigkeiten ergaben sich für die Vt, als alle drei Faktoren gleichzeitig wirksam waren: Sie mieden lange Zeit das unvergällte Insekt häufiger als das vergällte, offensichtlich weil sie aufgrund ihrer Vorerfahrung die Vergällung dem falschen Insektentyp zuordneten. Auch hier lernten nur zwei der Vt, das unvergällte Insekt zu fressen. Eine formale Auswertung der Werte für die Lerndauer ergibt, daß die Wirkungen der drei Faktoren sich nicht rein additiv verhalten, sondern daß entweder zur additiven Wirkung eine Wechselwirkung zwischen den Faktoren neue Alternativbeute und Ähnlichkeit hinzukommt oder daß sie sich multiplikativ verhalten, wobei die multiplikative Gleichung die Versuchsdaten am besten wiedergibt. Die quantitativen Aussagen werden dadurch eingeschränkt, daß Generalisation das Verhalten der Vt beeinflußte und daß einige auf schwierige Lernbedingungen nicht mit einer quantitativen Antwort (verlängerter Lerndauer), sondern qualitativ, d. h. mit der Weigerung, den Insektengeber weiter zu bedienen, reagierten. Aus dem Lernverhalten der Vt und einem Vergleich der Versuchs‐ mit Freilandbedingungen ergibt sich der Schluß, daß Vögel im Freiland ungenießbare Insekten rasch meiden lernen, da die Lernbedingungen hier meist günstig sind und da Vögel dazu neigen, sich bei evtl. doch auftretenden schwierigen Lernbedingungen an problemloser erreichbare Beute zu halten. Dies wird sicher durch das vielfältigere Beuteangebot und die räumliche Verteilung der Beutetiere im Freiland erleichtert. Die Bedeutung der Befunde für das Verständnis Batesscher Mimikry wird diskutiert. 1980 Blackwell Verlag GmbH			1980-01-01
Neuroanatomy of the visual afferents in the horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus)	The central nervous system of Limulus consists of a circumesophageal ring of fused ganglia and a paired ventral nerve cord. The anterior portion, the protocerebrum, receives sensory inputs including visual information. Three optic nerves, one each from the lateral eye, median ocellus, and ventral eye enter each side of the protocerebrum. The central connections of each optic nerve were determined by staining cut nerve trunks with cobalt chloride. The lateral optic nerve innervates the lamina, medulla, optic tract, ventral central body, and ocellar ganglion. The branching patterns of single axons, probably those of eccentric cells in the lateral eye retina, were observed. Single, large‐diameter axons in the lateral optic nerve ramify at seven loci including sites in each of the structures innervated by the lateral optic nerve as a whole. The median optic nerve innervates the ocellar ganglion, central body, optic tract, and medulla. Three types of branching patterns were observed for single, large‐diameter fibers in the median optic nerve. One type bypasses the ocellar ganglion and innervates the central body. A second type passes through the ocellar ganglion and optic tract without branching and innervates the posterior medulla. A third type innervates the ocellar ganglion, ventral central body, optic tract, and medulla. The ventral optic nerve is composed of large‐diameter axons of ventral photoreceptors. Each axon enters the ganglion cell layer of the medulla and branches over a planar area less than 150 μm in diameter. We also observed that axons from mechanoreceptors on the anterior carapace innervate the posterior neuropil of the medulla, and that about 5% of the neurons in the medullar ganglion cell layer send axons to the ipsilateral circumesophageal connective.

Fine structural aspects of the developing compound eye of the honey bee, apis mellifera L.	We studied the postembryonic development of the compound eye of the worker honey bee on the light and electron microscopy levels. During the late third and early fourth larval instars the cells of the optic primordium became organized into preommatidial cell clusters. Each cluster contained four prospective cone cells, nine prospective retinula cells (of which the ninth was centrally located and shorter than the other eight), and an undetermined number of prospective pigment cells. During ommatidial differentiation that was characterized by ommatidium and crystalline cone elongation, the ninth retinula cell moved laterally, and each retinula cell elaborated a rhabdomer. Possible roles of membrane junctional specializations and cytoplasmic microtubules in the processes of differentiation are discussed. © 1980 Academic Press, Inc.		animal experiment, arthropod, compound eye, electron microscopy, embryo, organogenesis, visual system, Animal, Bees, Cell Differentiation, Eye, Larva, Metamorphosis, Biological, Microvilli, Organoids, Photoreceptors, Pigments	1980-01-01
Occurrence of Melanosis and Other Diseases in the Queen Honeybee, and Risk of their Transmission During Instrumental Insemination	Melanosis-like symptoms occur frequently in honeybees in Denmark. Investigation revealed great variation among colonies and among apiaries. No correlation was found between thesymptoms and drone-laying or otherwise ineffective queens, or the occurrence of Nosema apis. Several yeast species were isolated from queens with melanosis-like symptoms or ineffective queens, but no isolates caused either melanosis-like symptoms or other indications of disease. Paecilomyces lilacinus caused a lethal disease when introduced into the reproduction organs of instrumentally inseminated queens, and it is probable that similar ‘spontaneous’ infective may occur during mating. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Insulin-like and glucagon-like peptides in insect hemolymph	Haemolymph from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta (L.), was examined for insulin-like, glucagon-like and gastrin-like peptides. Several immunoreactive components similar in size to vertebrate insulin and glucagon were separated by gel filtration of acid extracts of larval and pupal haemolymph. No gastrin-like peptide was detected. These results provide evidence that at least two of these peptide hormones are transported in haemolymph to target tissues in insects. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Purification and Properties of α-Glucosidases of the Honey Bee Apis mellifera L.	Two kinds of a-glucosidase (I and II) were isolated from honey bees by salting-out chromatography with ammonium sulfate. a-GIucosidase I was purified by chromatography on CM-cellulose and gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. a-Glucosidase II was purified by chromatographies on DEAE- and CM-celluIose and by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-150. Both enzyme preparations were homogeneous in tests by disc electrophoresis. The molecular weight of a-glucosidases I and II was estimated to be approximately 9.8 x 104 and 7.6 x 104, respectively, by SDS disc electrophoresis. a-Glucosidases I and II were glycoproteins whose carbohydrate moieties were about 25% and 15%, respectively. Their pH optima were 5.0. Both a-glucosidases readily hydrolyzed phenyl-a-glucoside, sucrose and maltose. a-Glucosidase I showed no activity toward isomaltose and soluble starch, but a-glucosidase II showed relatively high activity toward isomaltose and slight activity toward soluble starch. © 1980, Japan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Agrochemistry.

Acceptance by Honeybee Colonies of Larvae in Artificial Queen Cells	Some factors affecting the acceptance of grafted queen cells were studied. Acceptance was low (32%) when queen pheromone (9-oxodec-trans-2-enoic acid) was present in the wax of artificial queen cups. Statistically significant differences were found between the acceptance rate of queen cups made of: (a) beeswax from old brood combs (86·6%), (b) fresh beeswax (76·6%), (c) capping wax, beeswax foundation, or equal parts of paraffin and old beeswax (70%). Pure paraffin cells were not accepted at all. Acceptance was independent of the time of day or night when grafting was done. Acceptance of cells primed with royal jelly containing 10% bee-stored pollen was 50·9%, but 93·3% for control cells primed with pure royal jelly. Royal jelly containing 10% stored pollen caused much rejection when added to cells containing developing queen larvae. Acceptance was 86·2% for cells primed with royal jelly containing 10% honey, but only 52% with royal jelly containing 5% honey and 5% stored pollen. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Evidence and Action of Cannibalism Substance in Apis Cerana Indica	Of 26 colonies investigated, 11 were headed by Apis cerana indica queens sibling-mated to several drones. The queens produced diploid drone larvae in about 25% of worker cells. Altogether, 9734 eggs were individually recorded, and the survival rate of brood was monitored on successive days. All the results showed that diploid drone larvae of Apis cerana are not eaten by nurse bees during the first day of larval life as in Apis mellifera. In unfavourable environmental conditions some were eaten in place of worker larvae. Many diploid drone larvae were eaten in their second day of life, but some were reared even until the fourth day, and in favourable conditions some probably reach the adult stage. This suggests that A. cerana diploid drone larvae secrete much less cannibalism substance at the beginning of larval life, but later produce it for a much longer period of life, than do A. mellifera diploid drones. This is another specific difference between the two species of Apis, indicating an earlier evolutionary stage in A. cerana. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Hoarding Behaviour and Life Span of Inbred, Non-Inbred and Hybrid Honeybees	Caged groups of 50 newly emerged workers (Apis mellifera carnicd) stored the sugar solution provided (and in other experiments honey) in empty comb in their cages. On average, non-inbred workers took the food significantly faster than inbred workers, and hybrid workers took it faster than inbred workers of their parental lines. These results are discussed with respect to earlier results showing a difference in recruiting ability between inbred and non-inbred colonies. On average non-inbred workers lived longer than inbred workers, and hybrid workers longer than workers from their parental lines. Implications are discussed of inbreeding depression and heterosis, for both hoarding behaviour and length of life of workers, in relation to the theory of genetic load in haplo-diploid systems. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Sterol utilization in honey bees fed a synthetic diet: Analysis of prepupal sterols	The sterols of prepupal honey bees, Apis mellifera L., from brood reared by workers fed chemically-defined synthetic diets containing cholesterol, campesterol, sitosterol, stigmasterol, 24-methylenecholesterol, or no sterol over a 12-week period were isolated, identified, and quantified. The major sterol present in each prepupal sample was 24-methylenecholesterol, but significant levels of sitosterol and isofucosterol were also present in every case, as was a very small percentage of desmosterol (usually < 1%). This is the first report of isofucosterol being identified in the sterols of the honey bee. A considerably larger percentage of each dietary sterol was found in prepupae reared by workers fed that particular sterol in the diet. This was most dramatic in the case of the cholesterol diet in which case cholesterol content increased to as much as 17.2% of the prepupal sterols, whereas cholesterol had not exceeded 2.2% in samples from other diet regimens. However, stigmasterol comprised no more than 6.3% of the total sterols in any sample from prepupae fed the stigmasterol diet. The preponderance of 24-methylenecholesterol in all prepupae, regardless of the dietary sterol provided to the workers, as well as the lesser quantities of sitosterol and isofucosterol present in all samples, suggest a unique system of utilization and metabolism of these dietary sterols by the worker bees. Apparently they make available to the brood varying amounts of unchanged dietary sterol plus considerable and fairly constant portions of 24-methylenecholesterol, sitosterol, and isofucosterol drawn from their own sterol pools. © 1980.			1980-01-01

The effect of light on glycogen turnover in the retina of the honeybee drone	The retina of the compound eye of the drone (Apis mellifera) comprises two distinct classes of cells: the photoreceptors and the glial cells. The photoreceptors contain mitochondria and the photopigment (rhodopsin). The glial cells do not contain mitochondria, but large amounts of glycogen granules. Light stimulation causes intraglial glycogen metabolism to accelerate. Since glial cells are not directly excitable by light, it is deduced that the absorption of light by rhodopsin must somehow cause a signal to pass the glial cells to activate the glycogen metabolism.		glycogen, rhodopsin, animal experiment, arthropod, compound eye, photostimulation, retina, visual system, Animal, Bees, English Abstract, Glycogen, Male, Models, Biological, Neuroglia, Photic Stimulation, Photoreceptors, Retina, Rhodopsin	1980-01-01
Assay of carbaryl in honey bees (apis mellifera) by high-performance liquid chromatography	A method for detecting and measuring carbaryl in poisoned honey bees (100 ng per bee) using high-performance liquid chromatography is described. Clean-up of extracts on a Florisil column removed all substances that interfered with fluorescence detection and most that affected ultraviolet detection at 215 nm. Gas chromatography of carbaryl derivatives was not consistently useful because bee constituents interfered either with the formation of derivatives or with detection. Only the N-acetyl derivative was formed quantitatively in the presence of cleaned-up bee extracts, but the nitrogen-specific detector was sometimes, and the electron-capture detector always, subject to interference from bee constituents remaining after clean-up.		carbaril, arthropod, bee, liquid chromatography	1980-01-01
Ultrastructure of Invertebrate Chemo-, Thermo-, and Hygroreceptors and Its Functional Significance	Chemo-, thermo-, and hygroreceptors are primary sensory cells, which bear one or several modified cilia whose membranes are specialized to take part in the transduction process. These membranes must be exposed to the stimuli but also be protected against desiccation, mechanical, and other injury. Hence, a variety of structural specializations is found that serves these functions. In insects, chemo-, thermo-, and hygroreceptive sensory cells are located exclusively in sensilla, which are organelles built up by a definite number of characteristic cells. During development, the innermost enveloping cell produces a cuticular sheath (scolopale), which envelops the dendritic processes for varying distances along their course through the receptor lymph cavity. This sheath producing cell is surrounded by the trichogen cell, which is itself surrounded by the trichogen cell. These cells build up shaft and socket, respectively, of the cuticular outer structures during development. The perikarya of all cells of the sensillum are enclosed within the epidermis. © 1980 Academic Press Inc.		arthropod, chemoreceptor, electron microscopy, hygrometry, thermoreceptor	1980-01-01
Laboratory Measurement of Honey Production in the Honeybee I. A Model for Hoarding Behaviour by Caged Workers	The relationship was examined between honey production by 14 colonies and hoarding behaviour by workers from these colonies in laboratory cages. Hoarding of sugar syrup in the test cages (wt/bee/day) on days 5–15 after emergence seemed to be correlated with honey production. Hoarding on days 7–9 was highly correlated with colony weight gain (r = +0·684, P < 0·01), on days 5–6 and 10–15 less so, and on days 1–4 and 16-20 not at all. Analysis of variance revealed highly significant differences between source colonies for hoarding on days 7–9 (P < 0·001). These results provide the basis for a model of hoarding behaviour, in which hoarding in the cage on days 5–15, and particularly days 7–9, is related to honey production. Workers held for their first 7 days in a colony hoard syrup during the next 3 days similarly to newly emerged workers, not like workers 8–10 days old. The correlation for days 7–9 in the cages was apparently due to adjustment to life in a cage, after which amount of syrup they hoard falls into relationship with their colony’s production. This measurement of hoarding behaviour, unlike previously reported measurements, seems likely to be useful in a honeybee selection programme for increased production. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
In vivo control of haemolymph-α-glucosidase kinetics by glycemic components according to the developmental stages of worker-bees (Apis mellifica mellifica, L.)	1. 1. The main following correlations have been found between the α-glucosidase kinetics and the glycemia is determined in worker-bees-haemolymph. 2. 2. The maximum velocity (VM) is positively correlated with the trehalosemia (T) within each stage, but negatively from one stage to another. 3. 3. The affinity constant (K) is positively correlated with the glucosemia (G) within each stage, and negatively, again, over the entire development range. 4. 4. The Hill coefficient (nH) is only negatively correlated with the glucosemia within each stage. 5. 5. These enzymic mechanisms allow an auto-control of the (T)/G) ratio, as a complement to other (hormonal) ways of glycemic regulation. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Information-statistical analysis of social interaction and communication: An analysis-of-variance approach	Using informational statistics, an analysis-of-variance model is developed for separating the exclusive effects of two simultaneously present factors on the variability of the ongoing behaviour of a reference subject. In particular the following factors are considered: the preceding behaviour of the reference subject itself and the preceding behaviour of its partner. Effects due to the latter are usually regarded as representing communication. The model is compared with other information-statistical models for social interaction proposed in ethological research. Three properties are discussed: structural complexity, the rationale for identifying relevant effects and the efficiency in measuring them. With respect to measuring communication it is shown that several existing models confounded inter-individual and intra-individual effects in behaviour sequences. It is pointed out that different analytical frameworks (e.g. Markovian stochastic processes or analysis-of-variance) can use the same information-statistical formalism but give rise to different interpretations. Finally, the relation between the complexity of inter- and intra-individual effects in interaction sequences and the structure of information-statistical models is discussed. In Appendix I computational procedures are specified; in Appendix II a Monte Carlo procedure for testing observed variability measures is presented. © 1980.			1980-01-01
Anti-Rheumatic Drugs: Present Deadlock and New Vistas	This chapter discusses anti-rheumatic drugs. The broadly accepted views on anti-rheumatic drugs in present clinical use have been discussed mainly as background information. The side effects of clinically used anti-rheumatic drugs or rather, biopharmaceutical and structural modifications required to abolish side effects, have also been discussed in this chapter. It discusses several drugs that are not anti-inflammatory but do benefit rheumatoid arthritis patients, influence events that are either not involved in conventional inflammatory animal models or their possible involvement has not been sufficiently explored. Besides rheumatoid arthritis, there are two other joint conditions in which inflammation dominates: gouty arthritis induced by monosodium urate crystal deposits and pseudo-gout. The chapter discusses physiological mechanisms, as they seem to operate (as defective autoregulatory processes) during rheumatoid arthritis to cause the unpredictably fluctuating spontaneous remissions. © 1980, Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press.

Effect of Sex Allele Homo-Heterozygosity on Honeybee Colony Populations and on their Honey Production 1. Favourable Development Conditions and Unrestricted Queens	Virgin queens were each mated to two brothers, giving three groups of queens producing offspring with different combinations of sex alleles. In all, 26 500 brood cells were individually examined to determine brood survival rates; also 7720 measurements of brood areas were made in colonies, weekly in 1977 and at 3-weekly intervals in 1978. Of 32 queens, 8 produced brood of 50% survival rate, 14, of 75% and 10, of 100%. Influence of the composition of sex alleles on the brood area was apparent 3 weeks after equalization of colony populations. Similar brood areas were found in all three groups of colonies during spring and autumn, but in summer colonies with brood of 50% and 75% survival rates produced 68% and 82%, respectively, of the brood area found in normal colonies. When queens in normal colonies laid fewer than 1000 eggs daily, those producing brood of lower survival rates were able to replace non-surviving larvae by new eggs, but this was not possible with higher laying rates. Colonies with brood of 50% and 75% survival rates had (in relation to normal colonies) 79% and 89% of the worker population in spring. In summer normal colonies had 30 000 workers, and those with brood of 50% and 75% survival rates only 35% and 93% as many, respectively. In autumn the values were 65% and 91%. Colonies with brood of 50% and 75% survival rate produced 50% and 102%, respectively, of the 12 kg of surplus honey harvested from normal colonies. Interaction occurred between the progress of the season and the amount of brood, worker population and honey produced by the three groups of colonies. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Rapid Estimation of the Number of Sex Alleles in Panmictic Honeybee Populations	A simple formula, based on Kerr’s (1967), is proposed for estimating the number of sex alleles in a panmictic honeybee population. Only the mutation rate and the number of colonies need be known. Values are in agreement with those obtained by other methods, especially with a mutation rate of 10−5. The only exception is the population on Kangaroo Island, S. Australia (Woyke, 1976), which is not considered to be a panmictic unity. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Cuticular lipid biosynthesis in the scorpion, Paruroctonus mesaensis	The synthesis of cuticular and hemolymph lipids in the scorpion Paruroctonus mesaensis, was examined using radiolabeled acetate and palmitic acid. Incorporation of 1‐14C‐acetate into cuticular lipids was very low (0.03–0.13% of injected label), with the hydrocarbons exhibiting only trace (CPM's not significantly higher than background) radioactivity after 24 hours. Cuticular alcohols had the highest incorporation (ca. 80%) followed by free fatty acids and triglycerides. Hemolymph lipids also showed poor incorporation of labeled acetate (0.01%) and little activity in the hydrocarbon fraction. Incorporation of 1‐14C‐palmitic acid into cuticular lipids (0.86–1.21%) and hemolymph lipids (0.62–1.00%) was slightly higher, but still well below incorporation values observed for insects. The majority of the label appeared in the free fatty acids; hydrocarbons continued to show only trace radioactivity. Except for differences in the relative amounts of specific components, cuticular and hemolymph hydrocarbons were similar in composition. These results suggest that hydrocarbon biosynthesis in adult scorpions is very low during the intermoult period or that other compounds are preferred precursors.

Spermathecal ultrastructure of the insect Rhodnius prolixus stal	The paired spermathecae of Rhodnius are simple tubular out‐pocketings of the common oviduct. Each consists of a short muscular proximal duct and the distal glandular region with a blind tapering end. The spermathecal wall has a cuticular intima, slender columnar epithelial cells and ensheathing longitudinal striated muscle, connective tissue, tracheoles, and nerves. Glandular epithelial cells possess an elaborate apical secretion‐filled tubular inpocketing with an extensively folded plasma membrane. Laterally, cells interact by desmosomes, septate desmosomes, and extensive interdigitations. The cytoplasm is rich in longitudinally oriented microtubules associating with membrane densities along the invagination, lateral, and basal plasmalemmae. Apical concentration of mitochondria suggests their role in secretion or ion transport. The possible role of the spermathecae in maintaining the stored luminal sperm and its role in transmitting the mating stimulus is considered in light of the epithelial ultrastructure. The ultrastructure of the spermathecae of Rhodnius differs significantly from that of other insects. Copyright © 1980 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.			1980-01-01
Effect of weather factors on honeybee flight activity and colony weight gain	For three consecutive years, the flight activity from 10 honeybee colonies was recorded for a whole day at the beginning, middle and end of the flow. The outgoing flights started at about 9.00 h reach a maximum between 14.00 and 16.00 h and ceased at about 21.00 h. Multiple correlation coefficients of humidity, temperature, wind speed and light intensity with flight activity ranged from + 0.701 to + 0.978, all highly significant. Correlation coefficients of temperature with flight activity ranged from + 0.532 to + 0.947, also highly significant. There was a significant direct relationship between flight activity and colony weight gain 30 min later. This weight gain was correlated with honeybee activity and the above four weather factors (+ 0.490 to + 0.837, all highly significant). The mean daily flight activity of a colony was highly significantly correlated with the total weight gain of the colony at the end of the season (− 0.766 to + 0.879). This relationship was not significant on a day with no weight gain. Mean flight activity significantly differed between years. Overwintered colonies flew more than package colonies. A single day’s activity was related to the total seasonal weight gain of the same colonies. The results suggested that a single day–s gain is also related to the total seasonal gain, and that by weighing colonies on two consecutive mornings the highest-gaining colonies could be selected for breeding. © 1980 International Bee Research Association.			1980-01-01
Further evidence of insect growth disruption by neem seed fractions	Four panially purified neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) seed fractions, NN 18–701, NN 18–705, NN 18–79a and NN 18–79b, have been tested for growth disrupting activity with two holometabolous insects, Ephestia kuehniella Zell. and Apis mellifera L. The neem fractions were applied topically to the spinning stage of last larval instar of E. kuehniella and third larval instar of A. mellifera. Fraction NN 18–79a was most effective, followed by NN 18–705, in causing metamorphic disturbances in both the insects; NN 18–79b was third in effectiveness, while NN 18–701 was almost inactive. However, fraction NN 18–705 showed higher antifeeding activity than fraction NN 18–79a. The treatment of E. kuehniella larvae with the neem fractions caused delayed larval development, and in NN 18–79a treatment, many died as larval‐pupal intermediates; pupal and adult malformations were also observed. In A. mellifera, maximum mortality occured immediately before larval‐pupal ecdysis. It seems that the insect growth disrupting activity exhibited by neem seed fractions NN 18–705 and NN 18–79a, is independent of feeding inhibition. Weiterer Nachweis einer Hemmung der Insektenentwicklung durch Fraktionen aus Neemsamen Vier angereicherte Fraktionen aus Neemsamen (Azadirachta indica A.

Die Neemfraktionen wurden dem letzten Larvenstadium (Spinnlarven) von E. kuehniella und dem dritten Larvenstadium von A. mellifera topikal appliziert. Die Fraktion NN 18–79a verursachte bei beiden Insekten die stärksten Metamorphosestörungen, gefolgt von NN 18–705 und NN 18–79b, wahrend NN 18–701 kaum aktiv war. Fraktion NN 18–705 hatte aber bei Bienenlarven eine stärkere Fraßabschreckung als NN 18–79a. Mit Neemfraktionen behandelte E.‐knehniella‐Larven entwickelten sich verzögert oder überhaupt nicht weiter. Mit NN 18–79a starben viele als Larven‐Puppen‐Zwischenformen; Mißbildungen von Puppen und Adulten wurden ebenfalls beobachtet. Bei A. mellifera lag das Maximum der Mortalität unmittelbar vor der Larven‐Puppen‐Ecdysis. Die durch die Neemfraktionen NN 18–705 und NN 18–79a verursachte Entwicklungshemmung scheint nicht von ihrer fraßabschreckenden Wirkung abzuhängen. 1980 Blackwell Verlag GmbH			1980-01-01
